</table><p>Rotorua HomeBased Childcare requires further development with developing systems and processes that will guide effective operations and sustainability, and will inform change and improvement over time.</p><p>In addition, formalising the processes and design of self-review needs to be implemented. This will support effective evaluation and further improve teaching practice linking to quality learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotorua HomeBased Childcare is a licensed all-day, home-based education and care service operating in the Rotorua region. It is privately owned and operated and is licensed for 40 children including up to 20 under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the roll of 56, included 16 MƒÅori children.</p><p>The licensee, who is a qualified, fully registered teacher and the owner and operator of the service, coordinates and oversees the education and care for children who attend. Children are placed with educators, who care for up to four children at any one time in their own home. In addition, a second qualified and fully-registered visiting teacher visits children in educators' homes. The quality of education in the network is overseen by the licensee. She works alongside the visiting teacher to provide professional learning support and development of educators' knowledge and skills in teaching and learning.</p><p>The service's philosophy recognises that everyone has a role to play in the development of the child, and the early years are an important part in that. Children benefit from strong relationships based on trust and a positive learning environment. Educators work alongside parents to create a flexible and natural atmosphere in which children can flourish. In this role, they are helping to build caring relationships and promote an understanding of the world children live in.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for the service which was established in 2015.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is welcoming to children and their whƒÅnau. Respectful relationships support whƒÅnau to get to know the educators well. WhƒÅnau and educators are matched on enrolment to support a sense of wellbeing and belonging. Children are encouraged to be confident in their relationships with educators that promote a love of learning.</p><p>Children's learning is supported by curriculum and resourcing that focuses on exploration and creativity. Trips and excursions into the community are promoted to extend learning. Playgroups and regular events foster social competence between children of varying ages. Children are encouraged to take risks and face challenges outside of the home. Individual interests are documented through assessment, and educators support engagement in activities. Ongoing feedback to parents through an online assessment system encourages feedback. The curriculum enables children to enjoy a range of learning experiences.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years enjoy responsive and nurturing relationships. Individual rhythms and home routines are followed to promote continuity of care. Transition into and out of the service is seen as a tool to build social competency. Children benefit from calm and unhurried interactions that support them to develop confidence in who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>A strong level of trust between educators and the visiting teacher promotes sharing of information and knowledge through regular visits. Educators are provided with leadership experiences through the expectation of taking turns running weekly playgroup activities. Professional learning and development meetings, held on a termly basis provide educators with some understanding of learning experiences and outcomes. Educators are provided with learning opportunities that build on their skills in order to grow and nourish children's curiosity.</p><p>Leadership is collaborative and transparent across the service. Consultation processes have been promoted to support positive relationships. Policies and procedures have been developed and reviewed with multiple voices sourced through this process. An approach to internal evaluation has been explored. However, development is necessary to better support high-quality practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for this service are to develop key leadership and governance capabilities. Particular priority needs to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a current and purposeful strategic plan that outlines direction, and provides the basis for monitoring development and ongoing review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unpacking the centre philosophy so that it is relevant and enacted by all educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an appraisal process, system and policy to effectively guide qualified teachers/educators through the registration procedure, and build visiting teacher capability and leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning and development about planning and assessment practices for educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bicultural curriculum where children's language, culture and identity is evident in the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rotorua HomeBased Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management policies and procedures. To meet requirements the service needs to improve in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update current policies and procedures so that there is clear alignment with current regulatory requirements, including appraisal for educators and visiting teacher that supports teacher registration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reporting and quality assurance systems through robust internal evaluation, which promotes ongoing improvement particularly in relation to a deeper engagement in annual/strategic plan,</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008,</em> GMA5, GMA6, GMA7]</i></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rotorua HomeBased Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>27 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
