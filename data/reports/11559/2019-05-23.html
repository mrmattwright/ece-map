</table><p>Kamo Kids Educational Childcare Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kamo Kids Educational Childcare Centre is located in a residential and business area of Kamo. It is licensed to provide education and care for up to 50 children from two years to school age. More than half of the children enrolled are MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers are currently reviewing the centre's philosophy to reflect their vision of positive outcomes for children. At the heart of the philosophy is celebrating each child as a unique individual and providing a curriculum that is responsive to their emerging interests and strengths. Teachers are committed to extending children's learning, sparking their curiosity and passion for learning.</p><p>The centre has a new head teacher since the 2015 ERO review. Most of the teaching team are qualified early childhood teachers. An untrained teacher and a teacher aide/kaimahi support the teaching team. The centre manager oversees all personnel matters.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report commented positively about many aspects of teaching that contribute to children's learning. These good practices are still evident. Leaders and teachers have reviewed and strengthened the identified areas for development. The head teacher is focused on building leadership capacity, and a reflective, inquiring and collaborative team culture, to achieve positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are articulate and confident explorers who lead their own learning. They are independent, enthusiastically engage in activities and find an interest to explore. Children are sociable, play well with their peers and form strong friendships. They confidently approach and engage with teachers. Children have a deep engagement with te reo MƒÅori that is purposefully integrated into the learning programme.</p><p>Children benefit from a calm, caring and settled environment that fosters their sense of belonging and meaningful engagement in play. A culture of care and kindness pervades the centre. Effective teaching practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>warm, inclusive and respectful relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interactions with children that foster their sustained engagement in play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skilful use of research and theory that builds teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers communicating with each other and children to support seamless transitions throughout the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>managing transitions within the centre and to school.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are embedded in the centre philosophy and underpin teaching practices and curriculum planning and assessment. The programme is child-led. Play and having fun are valued, and the environment is viewed as the 'third teacher'. The indoor and outdoor areas are inviting and stimulating. Teachers plan environments and play areas to provoke children's interests and support their engagement in learning.</p><p>A strong commitment to building resilient, independent and confident children underpins the curriculum. Teachers plan learning opportunities in science, environmental sustainability, creativity, and early literacy and mathematics. Increased integration of children's languages and cultures in the curriculum is evident.</p><p>Teachers have improved the quality of planning. Children's learning is well documented and analysed in portfolios. Teachers make appropriate links to research and theory to enrich the analysis of children's learning and development.</p><p>Teachers have strengthened their focus on building learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. They actively seek parent aspirations and contributions, and use this to inform programme and individual planning. Teachers provide a range of approaches for parents and whƒÅnau to give feedback and use these valuable perspectives as part of internal evaluation.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have built a team culture that is highly reflective and open to learning. 'Teaching as inquiry' is supporting teachers to critically reflect on areas of interest in their teaching practice or within the curriculum. Sound appraisal processes support teachers to identify meaningful goals and be innovative in their practices. Leaders make very good use of external expertise to support the centre manager and head teacher.</p><p>The centre's well-defined mission statement guides all operations and practices. A clear policy framework and internal evaluation, support staff to review a range of practices. The centre manager is appropriately committed to building sustainable leadership for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepening learning outcomes and teaching strategies in documented planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teacher capacity to challenge children's thinking and engage them in complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using the Quality Practice Template to strengthen links between teachers' evidence and reflections, and the Teaching Standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involving all teachers in the development of strategic and annual plans, and including strategic goals for ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kamo Kids Educational Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>23 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
