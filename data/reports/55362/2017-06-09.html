</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sagata Ana Childcare is an aoga amata providing a Samoan language service for children aged six months to five years. The aoga opened in 1988 and is affiliated with the Samoan Catholic Association. It operates in an historic building owned by the Catholic Diocese in the grounds of St Anne's Catholic Primary School and next to Newtown Primary School.</p><p>The aoga provides full-day education and care for a maximum of 25 children, including up to five children under two years of age. Most of the children enrolled are Samoan. The aoga promotes mixed-age programmes and also provides separate areas for babies and toddlers to play and sleep. Children of all ages access the outdoor space.</p><p>The supervisor, manager and many staff have a long association with the centre. All staff are Samoan and all speak gagana Samoa fluently. A management committee consisting of parents and staff provides governance support for the centre. The centre's philosophy promotes values and practices that align with the Catholic and fa'a Samoa context. It also recognises the Treaty of Waitangi and the place of Maori as tangata whenua. Teachers have participated in professional learning to help them support children's literacy learning.</p><p>ERO's 2012 report for the centre identified many areas of good practice including positive teaching practices and noted that there had been improvements in the learning environment. Areas identified for improvement in that report have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed at the start of the day. Children settle well and play in areas of their choice, and are well supported by their teachers. Children are kind, and play well together or alongside each other. They are socially and physically confident. Older children look out for and care for toddlers. They enjoy conversation with each other and adults, and are happy in their play.</p><p>Teachers enhance the pride that children, staff and parents have in Samoan language, culture and identity. Gagana Samoa is used consistently and modelled well by teachers throughout the programme. Children enjoy group times and the opportunities they have for music and movement and to greet each other in Samoan.</p><p>Teachers have positive, affirming interactions with children, demonstrating fa'aaloalo (respect) in their practice. They are gentle and attentive, and promote alofa for children. Teachers use respectful care approaches and value children's choice and decision making.</p><p>Children under two are well cared for with nurturing and sensitive support. Teachers provide very good support for children with special learning needs and make good use of specialist expertise. These good practices promote children's wellbeing, sense of security, and trust in adults.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They are supportive of each other and the goals and values of the aoga, including promoting children's joy in learning. They plan learning programmes based on 'O le Fala Mafafau', a thinking mat concept that identifies children's interests, dispositions and next steps for learning. This approach works alongside teachers' planning for monthly events and themes, literacy and numeracy, and music, movement and performance. Teachers prioritise opportunities to build children's oral language in learning programmes.</p><p>Children could benefit from centre leaders promoting further opportunities for literacy and numeracy in the context of play. Leaders and teachers could also improve children's independent access to learning resources, and use teaching strategies and practices that enhance children's creativity and critical thinking.</p><p>Centre leaders support teachers in their work and provide opportunities for staff to access professional learning. They provide good opportunities for parents to be involved in the centre, and welcome their input and ideas.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre include leaders and teachers developing learning programmes that promote increased levels of challenge for children.</p><p>In addition, the manager and supervisor would benefit from external support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the number of qualified staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' appraisal processes so that they meet the practising teachers' criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote staff understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool for ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that policies and practices align with changes in legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sagata Ana Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, centre leaders should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all furniture is secured so it does not move in the event of an earthquake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the building currently has a current warrant of fitness.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sagata Ana Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>9 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
