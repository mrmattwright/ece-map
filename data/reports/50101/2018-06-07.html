</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KIDZ @ 303 is one of two Central Baptist Kindergarten (CBK) services located in Whanganui. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 22 children aged up to two. Of the 30 children currently enrolled, ten are MƒÅori.</p><p>The service philosophy is to 'celebrate awesomeness alongside children, whƒÅnau and community through nurture and learning from a Christian kaupapa'. The values of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, wairuatanga and respect provide the foundation of expected outcomes for children. A peaceful and respectful approach is intentionally practised to cater for the specific needs of infants and toddlers.</p><p>This ERO evaluation is one of two reviews of services owned and governed by the Whanganui Central Baptist Kindergarten and Cr√®che Trust. Two CBK managers have oversight of the day-to-day operation of the centres. The team leader is the curriculum lead. All staff are fully qualified.</p><p>Key next steps identified in the October 2013 ERO report were to continue to strengthen teacher response to children‚Äôs ways of learning and partnerships with parents. Progress is ongoing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a curriculum that supports their sense of belonging and wellbeing. They freely choose from a range of appropriate activities within a calm, settled environment. Children are given space and time to explore, investigate and make sense of the world around them. They are curious and show empathy to others.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is developing. Children participate in waiata and karakia. Recent professional learning has increased teacher confidence to engage with te ƒÅo MƒÅori resources. This should continue to strengthen their use of te reo MƒÅori in meaningful contexts.</p><p>Teachers have highly respectful and responsive relationships with children. Routines are used as an opportunity to nurture and connect with children. Their independence and self-care skills are fostered. Consistent caregiving promotes children‚Äôs sense of security.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported in an inclusive environment. Teachers work with external agencies and parents to identify, progress and monitor learning goals for these children.</p><p>A well-considered transition process supports children‚Äôs sense of belonging as they move through the CBK centres. Teaching teams share important information and regularly review the support needs of transitioning children and their families.</p><p>How well teachers respond to children‚Äôs culture, language and identity is the focus of a current service wide internal evaluation. Acting on the findings of this review will be necessary to more effectively promote connection to children‚Äôs diverse cultures. In particular, staff should consider how to better reflect these aspects through assessment, planning and the daily programme.</p><p>Leaders have identified that developing a deeper understanding of strategies that foster educational success for MƒÅori is a next step. ERO‚Äôs external evaluation confirms this. As the relationship with local iwi grows added learning and understanding should enhance teacher confidence in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers are yet to fully explore teaching strategies to respond to Pacific learners.</p><p>The recently revised assessment, planning and evaluation framework is yet to be fully embedded. Group planning supports children's ongoing learning through specific focus themes. Teachers identify learning goals and plans for individual children based on their interests, needs and developing skills. Leaders acknowledge that more consistently identifying children's learning will better support the evaluation of their outcomes.</p><p>Strong relationships with parents and whƒÅnau are evident. Daily communication between teachers and parents supports continuity of care and information sharing. Leaders and teachers are exploring ways to build on these relationships to strengthen learning partnerships. This should promote a more meaningful response to parent aspirations.</p><p>Internal evaluation is becoming established across the service. Leaders are purposefully progressing teacher understanding and use to better show learner-focused outcomes. Teachers and leaders actively engage in a range of reviews, including teacher inquiry, to inform decision making and ongoing improvement. A next step is to identify indicators of high quality practice to allow effective monitoring and evaluation of changes made.</p><p>Leaders are committed to supporting ongoing professional development of the teaching team. They provide useful advice and guidance for them to effectively implement the curriculum. Regular opportunities are offered to build capability and stimulate teacher reflection. The recently revised appraisal process should effectively support teachers to strengthen their practice.</p><p>A clear vision assists managers and staff set the strategic direction for the service. The recently revised philosophy is underpinned by shared values and beliefs of governance, management, teachers and parents. Trustees are well informed of progress towards strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthen the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and implement strategies to maintain children's connections to their culture language and identity, including those that promote educational success for MƒÅori and for Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KIDZ @ 303 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KIDZ @ 303 will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>7 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
