</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stokes Valley kindergarten is located in Stokes Valley and provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. It offers morning sessions five days per week for older children and a shorter session for younger children, three afternoons per week. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 45 children.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the October 2012 ERO report, a new teaching team, including a new head teacher, has been established.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: assessment; planning and evaluation; building the self-review and evaluative capacity of teachers; extending childrens‚Äô learning; strengthening the appraisal approach; enhancing the use te reo MƒÅori; and targeted support for teachers from the association.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a free-play based programme. They experience a warm and welcoming learning environment. Teachers work alongside children to support and extend their learning. Children with additional learning needs are well supported and monitored. Where appropriate, teachers liaise with external agencies.</p><p>The head teacher has a clear vision for the kindergarten that provides direction for staff. With the establishment of a new teaching team, it is timely to review the philosophy in consultation with the kindergarten‚Äôs community. Once this is established, a next step is to develop clear indicators of good practice.</p><p>The use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is developing in the kindergarten. A next step is for teachers to consult with their MƒÅori whƒÅnau to develop an understanding of aspirations for their child. This should assist in promoting and celebrating childrens‚Äô culture, language and identity.</p><p>Promoting success for Pacific children is in the early stages of development. Teachers have drawn on the strengths of their Pacific community to enhance the programme provided. A next development is to engage with their families to further their understanding of what success for Pacific children looks like in this context.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profiles show their participation and interest in the programme. Providing more in-depth analysis of the learning, and use childrens‚Äô interests as the foundation for their learning is a next step. Teachers should also show in these records how they add challenge and complexity to learning to better reflect the child‚Äôs progress over time. Teachers have developed a range of useful information to help support parents and childrens‚Äô transition to school.</p><p>Self review is developing in the kindergarten. This can be strengthened by drawing on a wide range of literature to develop indicators for success. In addition, they should continue to build their capacity to evaluate.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. Kindergarten leaders should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to provide more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These provide information about how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements, and at times, make recommendations. These reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review, the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO indentified priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>consulting with the kindergarten‚Äôs community to establish a philosophy based on shared values and then develop clear indicators of good practice</li>
<li>engaging with both MƒÅori and Pacific families to establish a shared understanding of success in this context</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the review process by improving the evaluative aspects.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stokes Valley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ERO identified that the outdoor safety surfacing is in need of repair and requires immediate attention by the association.<em>[Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: R46, 1 (C)]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stokes Valley Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
