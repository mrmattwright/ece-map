</table><p>Requires further development</p><p>Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE requires further support to improve its capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Current support to improve assessment, planning and evaluation processes has contributed to recent improvements and should continue. Other areas to develop and that require external support include:</p><ul>
<li>strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>performance management and appraisal</li>
<li>teaching practice</li>
<li>evidence-based self review.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE is supported and managed by the Ngati Ruanui Trust Limited, which is a subsidiary of Te Runanga o Ngati Ruanui Iwi. It strongly reflects the priorities of the Ngati¬†Ruanui Education Plan and demonstrates a commitment to a whƒÅnau-based approach to children‚Äôs care and learning.</p><p>In September 2014, the centre received its full license from the Ministry of Education after a period of being provisionally licensed. To address the areas for improvement identified in the relicensing process, leaders and staff have been involved in professional development.</p><p>Some progress has been made by the centre in:</p><ul>
<li>acknowledging and including parents' aspirations</li>
<li>planning, assessment and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>However, this ERO report finds that there is limited progress evident in developing:</p><ul>
<li>self review for improvement</li>
<li>performance management and appraisal</li>
<li>annual planning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre is licensed for 45 children including 15 up to two years. At the time of this review there were 35 children on the roll.</p><p>This is the first education review of the centre since it opened in 2009. The head teacher was appointed in 2013.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is welcoming to all children and their parents and whƒÅnau. Strong and respectful relationships are formed with each family, supporting children‚Äôs sense of belonging. Teachers demonstrate positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers acknowledge whakapapa as integral to the development of a sense of self, belonging and connectedness. Centre teachers successfully promote a kaupapa MƒÅori learning environment. Developing partnerships that support children‚Äôs learning with parents and whƒÅnau is a centre priority. This helps with children‚Äôs smooth transitions to the centre and on to school.</p><p>The importance of play as a vehicle for learning is valued. Teachers join in child and adult-initiated activities where children‚Äôs talk is encouraged, accepted and respected. Children make sense of the natural, social, physical and material worlds. They have a range of opportunities for creative and imaginative play and the outdoor area provides physical challenge.</p><p>Teachers seek ways to maintain children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity. Teachers learn about local hap≈´ and iwi, their history, sites of significance and kawa. They incorporate this into the programme in a meaningful and respectful manner. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are totally integrated in children‚Äôs daily learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô observations of children in everyday activities builds a picture of what children know, understand, feel, are interested in and can do. Teachers value and seek the contribution of children, parents and whƒÅnau. Staff communicate well orally with parents to share information about children‚Äôs learning. Teachers view each family and its knowledge of their child as an integral part of the service‚Äôs learning community.</p><p>There is a clear focus on the development of social skills. Teachers model and reinforce appropriate positive behaviours and children are ably assisted to self-manage.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well catered for and supported. Teachers use suitable strategies to promote learning and participation. The centre has good relationships with external agencies that are involved as needed.</p><p>Learning stories are a good record of children‚Äôs individual and group experiences. They link home experiences and show children‚Äôs involvement in centre activities and learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy and vision clearly articulate its values and sets a framework for centre operation. Leaders show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the service. The next step is to have all practice in the centre reflective of the philosophy and values.</p><p>Leaders are beginning to develop a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They are strengthening their capability to fulfil their roles. Strategic planning priorities and areas for development have been identified.</p><p>Significant external professional development contributes to improved assessment, so that teachers respond to children‚Äôs learning needs. Staff need to extend children's thinking and add complexity to tasks, and they require further knowledge as teachers to do so. Strengthening planning and assessment needs to be ongoing.</p><p>Staff performance management and appraisal have not occurred since 2011. The recently introduced process requires further development to bring about the necessary improvement to teaching. Professional learning should be clearly linked to strategic priorities and each teacher's individual development needs.</p><p>Self review is in its very early stages of development and lacks the necessary rigour to support ongoing improvements. External facilitators contribute to some recent development of review practice development. Ensuring review practices are sustainable is a next step. Policies and procedures have yet to be ratified or reviewed. All staff are police vetted, but procedures for ongoing police vetting or for new staff are not in place.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identifies, and centre leaders agree, that to improve the curriculum the next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>to continue to develop effective assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>further review the curriculum to ensure the programme is responsive to all children‚Äôs individual strengths and learning needs</li>
<li>to establish a shared understanding of robust evidence-based self review</li>
<li>to develop a framework that leaders and teachers can use to inquire into and evaluate the effectiveness of their centre practices, policies and decision making.</li>
</ul><p>The centre's strategic and annual planning should include:</p><ul>
<li>clear goals linked to measurable outcomes for children's learning</li>
<li>a process that allows leaders to determine progress towards achieving the goals</li>
<li>evaluation of the success of decisions and strategies.</li>
</ul><p>To support teachers to improve their practice, leaders need to implement a rigorous and robust appraisal process that includes:</p><ul>
<li>goal setting linked to outcomes for children</li>
<li>opportunities for teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their practice</li>
<li>observations of practice</li>
<li>quality feedback and feed forward</li>
<li>identifying the professional learning needs of individual teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>performance management of personnel</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>policies and procedures, including for police vetting.</li>
</ul><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>establish an evidence-based process for self review</li>
<li>implement and maintain a regular review cycle for policies and procedures</li>
<li>ensure a rigorous process of appraisal is implemented annually for all teachers and leaders that promotes improvement in teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>(<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA6; GMA7)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE will be within two years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title="">Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
