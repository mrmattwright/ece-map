</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wanganui East Kindergarten is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children and has a roll of 45. Sessions operate from 8.30 am to 2.30pm. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The governing board is responsible for setting overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is responsible to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two cultural advisors were recently been appointed to support teachers to realise potential and success for MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>There has been sustained progress in relation to the October 2012 ERO review areas for improvement. This has been well supported by focused leadership, and professional learning and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be self-directed learners in an environment that allows for individual interests to be explored. Children know and understand routines. They move freely and confidently between spaces, displaying a sense of belonging.</p><p>A wide range of resources supports and develops children's learning interests, including creative play. They engage freely with adults and their peers. Learning occurs in a fun, positive atmosphere.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on priorities for children‚Äôs learning: inclusiveness, family and whƒÅnau links to home and centre, socialisation, independence, perseverance, resilience and environment. The philosophy is evident in assessment, planning and evaluation across the kindergarten‚Äôs practice.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy has been developed with staff, families, whƒÅnau and children. It is underpinned by the association priorities. These are reflected in displays of parents' aspirations and in children's profiles.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs physical environment has been the focus of a thorough self-review process. A stimulating environment allows children to select spaces to explore and challenge themselves. Digital technologies enhance positive learning experiences.</p><p>The Priorities for Children‚Äôs Learning initiative was guided by the senior teachers‚Äô response to a recent ERO National Evaluation report. This comprehensive, sound and strategic framework is used to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation processes in each kindergarten.</p><p>Learning stories are well documented and track children's emerging interests and learning over time. They make explicit links between kindergarten experiences and developing literacy and mathematical concepts. Parents and whƒÅnau are encouraged to actively contribute to, and reflect on their child's learning.</p><p>Teachers know the children well and use conversation to extend children‚Äôs ideas and interests. Planning is a well-considered, collaborative and visible in the kindergarten. Teachers respond to children‚Äôs interests and ensure a range of easily accessible resources.</p><p>A variety of avenues is available for parents to support the kindergarten and to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning, including community events and social media. An inclusive, welcoming approach between teachers, parents, families and whƒÅnau is evident.</p><p>The wellbeing of all children is a strong focus of the kindergarten. Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers access a range of external support services, and work together with families to enhance children's progress and development.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are evident in the curriculum. There is a commitment from teachers to support the culture, language and identity of MƒÅori children. Continuing to explore whƒÅnau aspirations for their children to succeed as MƒÅori, is an identified next step.</p><p>A review of transitions focused on how effectively children are moving on to school. Connections with local schools are strengthened and transitions beyond the centre are thoughtfully managed.</p><p>A well-structured framework is providing teachers with a clear understanding of the purpose and process for self review. They are making very good use of self review to evaluate the impact of teaching and programmes on children‚Äôs learning, guide improvement and sustain effective practices. Leaders and teachers have identified the importance of further embedding the self-review framework to strengthen the quality of teaching to promote outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and ERO agreed on the following next steps:</p><ul>
<li>to continue to embed the 'Priorities for Children‚Äôs Learning' in all aspects of the curriculum</li>
<li>to explore whƒÅnau aspirations and develop a shared vision for MƒÅori children's success, as MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of the Whanganui Kindergarten Association is continuing to build teachers‚Äô capability to be more responsive to MƒÅori and Pacific children‚Äôs culture, language and identity to enhance culturally responsive practices. ERO affirms this direction.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wanganui East Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wanganui East Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
