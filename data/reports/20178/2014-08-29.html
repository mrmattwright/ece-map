</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Uplands Kindergarten is a sessional and full day community based kindergarten in Remuera. It is owned and operated by the Somervell Presbyterian Church. Christian values and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpin the centre philosophy and practices. The kindergarten operates from a purpose built facility on the lower ground floor of the church building. It provides good quality education and care for up to 43 children over the age of three.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by a management committee comprised of volunteers from the congregation, parent representatives, and members of the Church‚Äôs ministry team.</p><p>There are four fully registered teachers. The team is led by the full time head teacher.</p><p>Morning sessions are designed for children from approximately 3 to 5 years of age. The afternoon sessions focus on developing skills for 4 to 5 year old children to help prepare them for transition to school. Flexibility with sessional and full-day options are provided to suit the needs of the community.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the management committee and teachers have responded positively to areas for development and review identified by ERO. They continue to improve their self-review processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Relationships are caring and respectful. Parents and teachers engage in meaningful conversations. Children and parents demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing in the centre.</p><p>Children are eager to participate in the programme. They freely access the carefully prepared and very well resourced indoor and outdoor learning environments. In this supportive environment, children work independently or cooperatively in small groups. They are focused and purposeful, particularly with creative and imaginative play.</p><p>Children are confident, articulate communicators. There is a busy atmosphere of social interaction amongst children and as they play together. Children readily engage in meaningful conversations with adults. This is a very positive feature of the centre.</p><p>Teachers are warm, affectionate, and caring with children. They promote children‚Äôs independence, leadership, and decision making in learning programmes. They also encourage children to be active problem solvers and to manage relationships effectively with others during play. Teachers provide challenges for children and promote persistence and perseverance. Noise levels are sometimes too high. Teachers should continue to model and encourage appropriate noise levels.</p><p>Programme planning is displayed to provide greater opportunities for parents and children to view developments and contribute to the programme. Portfolios provide clear information for parents and children. Stories are well written and include photos of children taking part in activities. Teachers could consider making better links between stories to indicate children‚Äôs ongoing learning through their interests.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô self-review processes are thorough and well documented. They have made a good start on their bicultural journey through self review. This is visible in the kindergarten in displays of MƒÅori language, karakia, and picture books. Children sing waiata with enthusiasm. Teachers are keen to continue to find ways of ensuring that te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori are more frequently heard, spoken and seen. Staff have identified the need to continue with their bicultural journey.</p><p>The kindergarten is supported by a very committed management committee. Policies and procedures are reviewed regularly with teachers to guide all aspects of management and governance. This helps to sustain and promote good quality education and care for children.</p><p>There is strong leadership in the kindergarten. Teachers are highly valued and step up to other roles when necessary. They are recognised for their strengths and are provided with professional development that aligns with their appraisals. The head teacher benefits from professional development and networking to support her leadership and mentoring practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten managers identified that next steps for teachers are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their bicultural practice</li>
<li>develop self review so that it leads to meaningful and continual improvements to the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Uplands Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Uplands Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>29 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
