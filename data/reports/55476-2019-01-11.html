</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dot Kids Early Learning Centre Greenmeadows Preschool is located in Greenmeadows Napier. It provides all day education and care for children from two years to school age, five days a week. Of the 52 children enrolled at the centre, 17 identify as Māori.</p><p>The service philosophy focuses on valuing respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships with tamariki, whānau and kaiako. Since the December 2015 ERO report, the centre has experienced some changes to the teaching team that included an appointment of a new centre manager. Most teachers are fully qualified. The outdoor learning space has been redeveloped to extend physical learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included: evaluating the curriculum to measure the impact on children's learning; celebrating local historic features; and focusing on evaluating how well practices promote positive outcomes for children. Progress in these is ongoing.</p><p>Dot Kids Preschool, previously known as Little Guppies ECLC PreSchool, was purchased by Provincial Education Group Limited (the organisation) in May 2017. They provide governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nation-wide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to centre staff. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><p>This review was one of seven services in the Provincial Education Group Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy was developed with leaders and teachers to determine the key valued learning outcomes for children. Leaders should consider how the centre can best consult with parents, whānau Māori and their Pacific community to deepen their understanding of what educational success looks like for them and their children in this context.</p><p>Children actively engage in a play-based programme. They experience warm and respectful relationships. Teachers know children well, they work alongside them supporting their learning and building social competence. Physical wellbeing is actively promoted. The outdoor learning space provides appropriate challenge to extend children’s physical skills.</p><p>Aspects of te ao Māori are valued and promoted in the programme. Waiata Māori and tikanga practices are well understood by children. Encouraging teachers to use te reo Māori in everyday practice is a next step. Leaders should consider how they can weave a place-based curriculum, where places of significant to the centre are celebrated and acknowledged in the programme.</p><p>Teachers have begun to unpack the recently introduced <em>Tapasā: Cultural Competency Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners</em> to strengthen their practices to support children and their families of Pacific heritage.</p><p>Children’s voices are valued and drawn on to inform group planning. Teachers use this to help extend the learning experiences offered. Clearly identifying the learning outcomes expected should assist in deepening the planning for learning and evaluation.</p><p>Children’s learning journals show their engagement in the programme, developing friendships and identified interests. Teachers are beginning to consider the aspirations of children and parents in the ongoing design of the programme. To enhance assessment documentation, leaders and teachers should consider:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a share understanding of what is expected for assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening the analysis of the learning to more effectively plan for children’s learning and progress.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A recent parent survey has affirmed teacher practice and provided feedback for ongoing consideration. Leaders have been responsive to the survey findings.</p><p>The centre is focused on improving the quality of education and care of children through systematic self-review. Leaders should continue to build teachers’ capability in evaluation so they can effectively measure the impact of the curriculum and teacher practice on outcomes for children.</p><p>Collaborative ways of working are fostered and promoted in the centre. Teachers have opportunities to share their individual curriculum strengthens.</p><p>A sound appraisal framework is in place. Recent professional learning and development with the Education Council has resulted in a clearer understanding of effective appraisal and the six teaching standards. The organisation is providing guidance and support for teachers in meeting these expectations. Further consideration should be given to developing clear, specific and measurable goals.</p><p>The organisation's senior leadership has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvement, for the benefit of children and whānau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding and take on distributed leadership roles.</p><p>A formal reporting process is now being implemented that provides feedback to teachers about the focus of professional leaders' visits.</p><p>A recent national initiative led by the organisation is providing opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to the valued outcomes of the service. The organisation should draw from these national findings to inform their strategic direction.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consult with parents, whānau and families to determine what educational success looks like for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage greater use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weave a place-based curriculum into the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and Provincial Education Group agree that to further strengthen practice, their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor the progression of strategic goals, through measurement of improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use formal internal evaluation processes at senior leadership level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effectively use the findings of the national philosophy review to inform the organisation’s strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of DOT KIDS EARLY LEARNING CENTRE GREENMEADOWS PRESCHOOL completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of DOT KIDS EARLY LEARNING CENTRE GREENMEADOWS PRESCHOOL will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>11 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
