</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindy Bubz is one of a group of four privately owned education and care services, located in the Queenwood suburb of Hamilton. The centre is licensed for up to 25 children aged from 0 to 2.5yrs in two separate rooms for infants and toddlers. At the time of this review there were 51 on the roll.</p><p>The centre offers whole day, morning or afternoon sessions. The centre philosophy states that it offers a semi-structured programme with a focus on literacy and mathematics for children in a safe, warm and nurturing learning environment. An emphasis is also placed on developing positive, reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report, identified the need for centre leaders to undertake a review of culture and identity and develop strategies to focus on children‚Äôs interests and learning dispositions. These areas are being addressed but there are aspects that require further strengthening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a calm, settled environment. Teachers know children well and form respectful, nurturing and positive relationships with them and their families. Children are able to make connecting links with their home and the centre.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from a safe, stimulating setting that encourages exploration. Small group sizes with a high teacher ratio support children's communication development, including oral language and non-verbal skills. Responsive relationships encourage children to learn and provide support for their individual needs and care routines.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-resourced centre, which supports their developmental stages. Children learn about their local community with trips and visitors to the centre. Cultural festivals are celebrated, building awareness of cultural identity. MƒÅori children are supported by teachers leading daily waiata and using some basic words and phrases. Te reo MƒÅori is visible in wall displays. Resources, including books and puzzles, also support the bicultural curriculum for all learners. Consideration should now be given to more use of natural resources to further enhance learning</p><p>Children who require additional educational support are clearly identified and teachers work in close partnership with their parents and external agencies. Highly inclusive practice supports these children to experience positive learning outcomes.</p><p>Teachers carefully plan the environment, offering a wide range of learning activities and resources for children. There are opportunities for children to engage and work alongside teachers in small and larger groups. The focus on literacy and numeracy is highly visible within the outdoor and indoor areas. Transitions into and within the centre are well supported. These are responsive to the needs of individual children and parents. Children develop a sense of belonging, and feel safe, secure and ready to learn.</p><p>There are strong partnerships with parents and many opportunities for them to participate in their child's learning. Children's learning is shared through daily dairies, portfolios and termly progress reports, where learning outcomes and developmental milestones are clearly identified. A next step is to ensure the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children and other cultures are more visible in portfolios. Consideration should also be given to making portfolios more accessible and visible, allowing children and their parents to regularly revisit previous learning.</p><p>There is a clear vision and direction for the ongoing growth and development of the centre. The centre owners have collaborated with the teaching teams and goals have been developed that are regularly monitored by management and the supervisors. There is an alignment between the strategic plan, annual plan, philosophy, and teachers professional development. Sound systems and practices contribute to continuous improvement for children and their families.</p><p>The centre supervisor models inclusive practice, promotes a clear vision and sets high expectations for building the capability of teaching and learning. A newly implemented appraisal system has been introduced to build teacher capability. Teachers use inquiry goals to strengthen their capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. An effective process for internal evaluation is focused on enhancing learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The key next step for Kindy Bubz is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural assessment practices and the use of learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate the appraisal process to include regular mentoring and observations of teaching practice, which includes specific feedback and forward.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Bubz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindy Bubz will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>6 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
