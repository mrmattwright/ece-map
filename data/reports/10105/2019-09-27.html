</table><p>BestStart Tironui Road is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Tironui Road is licensed for up to 50 children. It provides for older children in the Papatūānuku room, and for up to 12 infants and toddlers in the Rūaumoko room. The centre caters for the neighbouring community and parents who work in the area.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. The organisation has re-branded all its early learning services. It provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business managers (BM) and professional services managers (PSM) lead the staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The majority of staff are long-;-o8userving in the centre. A centre manager has been appointed since the 2016 ERO review. A team leader and some of the staff have been employed recently. Areas for development that were identified in ERO's 2016 report have been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in BestStart's Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome parents and children on arrival. Children engage positively in the warm and responsive environment and play cooperatively. They help one another and develop tuakana/teina relationships where older children support younger ones. Teachers' conversations with children help them connect their home life with centre experiences. They encourage parents/whānau to be part of their children's learning.</p><p>The spacious environment offers challenge, opportunities for risk-taking, and a wide variety of rich learning materials that children use to extend their play. Teachers provide a responsive and varied curriculum that incorporates the interests of children and includes a strong literacy, mathematics and science focus.</p><p>Parents share their 'hopes and dreams' for their children informally and in formal interviews. Teachers use this information to build development plans for each child. Leaders and teachers are developing learning partnerships with families. These relationships enable teachers to know children and families, and their context and aspirations very well.</p><p>Teachers record children's progress and learning in individual assessment portfolios. Clear continuity of learning, including social and creative development, can be seen in the learning journeys of individual children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers explore their environment independently. Teachers use care routines, such as nappy changing, to have focused interactions with individual children. They use music and movement effectively to stimulate children's play. Teachers' intentional interactions with infants and toddlers support oral language development. Teachers actively promote children's understanding of te reo Māori, through their use of waiata, karakia and greetings.</p><p>The teaching team builds shared knowledge and the service's capacity by displaying information about planning and learning. Leaders seek professional knowledge to guide their practice. They share leadership and value the strengths and interests of individual teachers. Internal evaluation helps teachers to improve and extend their practice.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Leaders and teachers regularly revisit the centre's strategic goals and annual action plans to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include teachers continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the sense-making aspect of internal evaluation to refine centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen curriculum planning, using evaluation findings to improve programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Tironui Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>27 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
