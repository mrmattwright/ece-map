</table><p>BestStart Queenstown¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Queenstown, formerly known as ABC Queenstown, was recently relicensed under its new name. The centre is owned and governed by the BestStart group. BestStart managers regularly visit and support the centre.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 75 children, including 25 children under two years of age. Children come from many different countries and some are English language learners.</p><p>The frequent movement of families in and out of Queenstown results in ongoing changes in staff and children. Recently there have been significant changes in centre leaders, teachers and caregivers. All caregivers hold an overseas qualification in education. Multilingual staff use their language skills to support children and their families from other cultures.</p><p>The centre is purpose-built, with four classrooms and a large kitchen. Children move through each room, depending on their age and readiness. Children under two share one outdoor area and older children share another. The centre provides healthy food choices, including cooked meals.</p><p>The centre philosophy states that teachers believe in: growing respectful, trusting relationships with children and their whƒÅnau; the importance of bicultural inclusion; and providing a natural and sustainable environment where children can fulfil their potential.</p><p>ERO found that centre leaders and teachers had made good progress against most of the recommendations in the 2016 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of early childhood education reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families experience positive and caring relationships with centre staff who are welcoming and inclusive of children and families from other countries. Some children have developed strong friendships with each other.</p><p>Children benefit from a very well-resourced environment with many natural materials. Resources and equipment are well presented and easily accessible, enabling children to make choices independently. Teachers have given careful consideration to setting out appropriate resources to challenge children of different ages.</p><p>Children take part in a broad variety of learning experiences, and teachers plan activities in response to their interests and needs. Children's diverse cultures are celebrated within the programme. Early literacy and numeracy concepts are promoted and integrated throughout daily activities. Children have good opportunities to explore the outdoor environment and develop their physical skills.</p><p>Children under two years of age and those with additional needs are sensitively supported. The infant and toddler classrooms are specifically set up for that age group. A wide range of sensory resources provide interest and enjoyable learning.</p><p>Effective group and individual assessment and planning helps children to grow their social, emotional and physical skills, as well as their understanding of the world around them. Teachers regularly review and set new goals for children's learning and plan the particular strategies they will use to support this. Learning stories record increasing complexity in children's development and understanding over time. Ensuring children experience smooth transitions into, within and out of the centre is an important aspect of the centre programme.</p><p>The centre is very well supported by the BestStart organisation. Sound governance systems provide a comprehensive policy and procedure framework and internal quality assurance. BestStart provides strong support for building leader and teacher capacity through targeted professional development and robust appraisal, including teachers inquiring into the effectiveness of their own practice.</p><p>The strategic and annual plans clearly show the direction of the centre and the areas for future focus. The BestStart priorities and the centre's identified needs inform the centre's strategic goals. There is clear alignment from these plans to the goals in teachers' appraisals, professional development provided, and the internal evaluation topics. The evaluations lead to well-considered changes and better outcomes for children.</p><p>New teachers go through a planned induction process. They are ably supported by the BestStart area manager and other centre staff throughout the day. Some useful guidelines provide teachers with a consistent understanding of expectations for practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and BestStart managers have identified, and ERO's evaluation confirms, that leaders and teachers need to develop the centre's localised curriculum and philosophy to better show 'what learning matters' to this community and this team of teachers. Leaders and teachers need to extend internal evaluation to review how well interactions support children's:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learning, engagement and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oral language acquisition (particularly for English language learners)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>independence and self-management skills.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of individual assessment, planning and evaluation could be strengthened by teachers explicitly gathering parents' wishes for their child's learning and development, and creating goals that reflect this.</p><p>Leaders and teachers need to continue to increase their confidence and competence around te ao and te reo MƒÅori (particularly as there is a high number of new teachers and teachers from overseas at this centre).</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Queenstown completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
