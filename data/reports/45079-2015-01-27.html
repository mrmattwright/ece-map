</table><p>HoNey BeeZ Preschool &amp; Nursery is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>HoNey BeeZ is a family-owned and operated service. The centre philosophy has a strong focus on biculturalism and children‚Äôs understanding and appreciation of the natural world.</p><p>A number of recent staffing changes have been well managed. There are increased leadership roles in the nursery and preschool. These leadership opportunities are building staff capability and further strengthening a team approach to decision making.</p><p>Centre managers have addressed most of the areas for improvement identified in ERO‚Äôs November 2011 report. Children experience positive and supportive interactions. There is an improved process for planning, assessment and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well engaged in their play activities. They spend extended times with their chosen resources and keenly share their interests with teachers. Interactions with children are positive and inclusive within a homely environment. Relationships between teachers, children, parents and whƒÅnau are warm and respectful.</p><p>Teachers make good use of conversations to extend children‚Äôs oral language. A range of outside activities successfully foster children‚Äôs play and exploration. Children are well supported to try new activities that help to develop their physical skills.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô planning effectively promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers work well together to plan activities to meet the interests and needs of each child. They use <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New¬†Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, as the basis for planning and include local resources where appropriate. Programmes are well evaluated and next steps for planning are clearly identified.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is monitored and evaluated through learning stories. In the best examples teachers:</p><ul>
<li>outline what children are learning</li>
<li>describe how they will further extend children‚Äôs thinking and learning strategies</li>
<li>include child and parent comments on learning</li>
<li>recognise and celebrate aspects of each child‚Äôs cultural background.</li>
</ul><p>There is a strong bicultural focus throughout the programme and in the centre‚Äôs documents. Nearly all teachers use te reo MƒÅori well. Leaders and teachers have begun making good links with iwi and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective in their practice and this is helping them to improve learning and teaching. Managers have introduced a process for centre reviews that should improve the consistency and usefulness of review outcomes. Useful spontaneous reviews are carried out on a regular basis.</p><p>Managers have completed a plan with goals that will give more specific direction to developments and improvements within the centre. They are improving their support for teachers through a newly introduced appraisal programme. They recognise the need for ongoing professional development opportunities for leaders and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teaches are increasingly able to identify areas of good practice and the next steps for improvement within the centre. They have made a number of improvements to planning, assessment, appraisal and self review. The centre leaders and managers have clearly identified their next areas for development. ERO and the centre managers agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>build a shared understanding of planning and make use of the sound curriculum knowledge of individual teachers, for example in mathematics, to support learning and teaching</li>
<li>further develop consistency in the writing of learning stories and include more child and parent voice</li>
<li>complete job descriptions and use them as part of the appraisal process</li>
<li>develop priorities and more detailed long term planning so that the achievement of the centre‚Äôs goals can be effectively managed</li>
<li>build a shared understanding of self-review expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of HoNey BeeZ Preschool &amp; Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of HoNey BeeZ Preschool &amp; Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern Region</p><p>27 January 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
