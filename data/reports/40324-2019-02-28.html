</table><p>Kiwi Educare Ltd¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Educare Ltd is a privately owned early childhood centre located in the eastern suburbs of Rotorua. The centre provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. It is licensed for 36 children, including ten up to the age of two years. At the time of ERO‚Äôs review, 22 children were enrolled, including 12 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy makes a commitment to working in partnership with whƒÅnau to provide a loving and caring environment. Teachers aim to promote strong tuakana teina relationships among children.</p><p>There have been some changes to the teaching team since ERO‚Äôs 2016 evaluation. The centre manager is the only fully registered, qualified early childhood education (ECE) trained teacher. One teacher is secondary trained and provisionally registered and two are in their first year of ECE training. The remaining staff are unqualified.</p><p>The centre is yet to address areas identified for improvement in the March 2016 ERO report. These relate to leadership, management and programme implementation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO is concerned about the quality of care and education provided, and the capability and capacity in the centre to implement and sustain necessary change. Urgent attention must now be given to improving the quality and implementation of the curriculum; teaching practice; health and safety systems; resource provision and human resource practices.</p><p>While responsive tuakana teina relationships are evident between children, teachers, and parents, children are yet to experience a curriculum that suitably responds to their abilities, interests, and needs. The curriculum needs strengthening to ensure that:</p><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum is consistently reflected and implemented by all teachers</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers have knowledge and understanding of children's learning and development, and early childhood education theories and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are opportunities for exploration, inquiry and physical challenge, particularly for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is provision of sufficient resources, opportunities and teaching interactions that enhance and extend the learning, development and creativity of all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>assessment, planning and evaluation reflects the</em> interests, strengths, language, culture and identify of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning partnership with parents and whƒÅnau are developed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Whilst the centre manager has focused on building a cooperative team culture, centre leadership requires improvement to effectively guide professional practice to promote high quality education. In addition, leaders must implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an annual cycle of appraisal, that sufficiently and consistently meets the requirements of the Teaching Council for the issue and renewal of practising certificates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety policies and procedures that are sufficiently robust to ensure they consistently meet all regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practise, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure procedures related to administering of medication, monitoring and recording of sleeping children, emergency plans and drills, monitoring of the temperature in the sleep room and outdoor safety surfaces, nappy changing procedures and safe food handling are consistently implemented.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance related to curriculum, premises and facilities, health and safety and governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers and leaders planning, implementing and evaluating a curriculum that is consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and is informed by relevant theories and best practice which responds to children's learning interests, strengths, and capabilities of enrolled children</p>
</li>
<li>effective governance and management in accordance with good management practices, including meeting its obligations in relation to the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em> and <em>Health and Safety at Work Act 2015;</em> ensuring there are suitable human resource practices related to police vetting, selection and appointments, appraisal and professional learning and development</li>
<li>
<p>sufficient quantity and variety of equipment and materials indoors and outdoors for the learning and abilities of the children attending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nappy changing facilities that suitably foster children‚Äôs independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ready access to facilities for washing sick or soiled children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documentation related to relevant regulatory and licensing requirements, complaints procedure and building codes and by-laws is prominently displayed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is adequate provision of up-to-date first aid supplies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment are secure in case of an earthquake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when children leave the premises on an outing or an excursion, assessment and management of risks is undertaken specific to the location and that parents/caregivers have given prior written approval for the child's participation, and the proposed ratio for special excursions is shared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service develops and implements a procedure for the management of serious injury, illness or incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sufficient number of teachers hold a current first aid qualification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service develops and implements an annual management plan.</p>
</li>

ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Educare Ltd will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
