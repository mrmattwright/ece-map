</table><p>Three Little Birds Kaitaia¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Three Little Birds Kaitaia is a privately owned centre, which was purchased from ABC Kaitaia and re-opened in 2018. Many families have remained at the service since the change of ownership. The centre provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children, including a maximum of 10 under two years of age. Most children have MƒÅori heritage.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes respectful and trusting relationships, with a focus on the individual child and their whƒÅnau. It encourages a learning programme and environment that captures the child‚Äôs strengths, interests and culture through exploration, challenges and fun. The philosophy also places priority on incorporating bicultural practices in the programme.</p><p>The Three Little Birds organisation has two other centres in Whangarei. Centres are supported by an operations manager and a professional leader who provide administrative and professional support. The new centre manager oversees day-to-day centre operations. The teaching team includes long-serving and newly employed teachers.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Three Little Birds Kaitaia.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau are welcomed into the centre. Teachers recognise the importance of building respectful and responsive relationships with children and their families. Children are settled and show a good sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Children work well together in their play, both independently and alongside each other. They communicate confidently with adults and share their individual experiences. Children with additional learning needs are well provided for through external agency support.</p><p>Teachers gently support children‚Äôs play to extend their interests and learning and to promote oral literacy. Teachers in the tuakana space use open-ended questions very well. Encouraging children's self-management skills is part of the daily routines.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive caring attention from adults who know them well. Teachers respond to their individual needs and care routines, and support learning as children play. Infants and toddlers have good opportunities to mix with older children.</p><p>Teachers value and respond to children's diverse cultures. While karakia and waiata are visible in the environment, providing more prompts in the environment could help teachers to increase their use of te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Records of children's learning and development over time are evident in displays and portfolios. Children‚Äôs and parents‚Äô contributions are highlighted in learning stories. Teachers communicate with whƒÅnau informally to seek their aspirations and expectations. This information could be used to help plan the centre‚Äôs programme and respond to children's individual preferences.</p><p>A specialist management group provides good support, and keeps the owner informed about the centre operations. The management group has developed policies and procedures that are regularly reviewed by teachers and parents.</p><p>Managers are developing a new appraisal process to meet Teaching Council requirements. This will ensure that appraisals are personalised and meaningful for all staff, and monitored on an ongoing basis. Continued professional development should help to embed shared understandings about expectations for teaching, reflective professional practice and 'teaching as inquiry'.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning is aligned with the centre‚Äôs philosophy and vision. It is timely now to review and adapt strategic and annual plans so they provide clear guidelines for centre development.</p><p>Internal evaluation is having a positive impact on children's learning. It includes consultation with children, whƒÅnau, parents, managers and staff. Leaders use a systematic approach that is focused on improving the quality of teaching.</p><p>As a result of internal evaluation, there have been significant changes to the environment, particularly children's access to resources. To build on these improvements, leaders could consider improving learning resources to encourage greater exploration and complexity in children's play. They could also adapt the infants' learning environment to create a more inviting and comfortable space.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a curriculum that is more responsive to te reo MƒÅori, and the cultural identity of tamariki MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen teachers‚Äô knowledge of the strands, goals and learning outcomes of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase teachers' understanding of internal evaluation to support ongoing improvement to teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Three Little Birds Kaitaia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>29 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
