</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Kaitaia, in the far north, provides education and care for up to 42 children. It operates under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd, who provides organisational and professional support for the centre.</p><p>Over recent years the centre has maintained stable staffing, with most teachers being qualified and registered.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age in two areas to cater for their developmental levels. The centre reflects its community, with most of the children from MƒÅori or New Zealand European backgrounds.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2013 report on the centre noted good practice in the way teachers supported the development of children‚Äôs social skills and encouraged tuakana-teina relationships, where older and younger siblings spend time together. These good practices continue to be evident.</p><p>The centre also has responded positively to ERO‚Äôs 2013 recommendations. The centre has made good progress in strengthening the quality of the programme. It has taken steps to ensure that organisational policies and practices are effectively administered and provided good professional support for staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happy in the open and expansive environment. They play well together and confidently engage with other children and adults. Children mostly play close to where teachers are working. Infants and toddlers are involved in the whole centre programme for part of the day. They also have time apart to enable teachers to place greater focus on their individual and age-related stages of development. This approach strengthens the responsiveness of the programme, provides good learning opportunities and enriches all children‚Äôs education and care.</p><p>Children are involved in play which has evolved from their emerging interests over time. They have ready access to indoor and outdoor play areas. A variety of activities are available and the programme is well resourced. Wall displays provide a good account of what children have been doing.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is integrated into the daily routines and programmes. Teachers use te reo to give simple instructions as part of story-telling, and as part of language and numeracy learning. This inclusion of te reo reflects the cultural heritage of many of the centre‚Äôs children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Teachers consistently interact with the children. They involve themselves in children‚Äôs play. Teachers should now look at ways of supporting children to deepen the complexity of their play. The process of reflecting on and reviewing teaching practice and improving teaching techniques should also become a regular event in teachers‚Äô professional practice to enrich learning experiences for children.</p><p>Parents are encouraged and invited to feed back on the practices and policies of the centre. Centre managers and teachers are now looking to further involve parents/whƒÅnau in the centre through establishing strong learning partnerships where teachers and parents work together to support children‚Äôs learning and progress. The proposed parent committee, as outlined in the strategic plan, could foster these partnerships, further involving parents in building the foundations of their children‚Äôs learning and helping them to assist their children‚Äôs learning at home.</p><p>Teachers are developing programme planning and evaluating outcomes of these programmes on a monthly basis. To further ensure that they are constantly looking to improve their practice, teachers should now extend their written evaluation to include their next steps for promoting quality teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Self review practices are becoming embedded and are helping the centre manager and staff to improve the daily programme and ongoing practices. Staff have grown in confidence with the use of self review. They see its importance for centre improvement. Parents‚Äô input is seen as an important contribution to improving the centre.</p><p>Personnel from Kidicorp Ltd provide effective guidance for the centre. Regular and consistent organisational and leadership support from a professional external expert has been a significant contributing factor that has guided and promoted centre improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, Kidicorp representatives and ERO agree that managers should provide wholecentre professional learning for teaching staff in order to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop a process of reflective practice and promote ongoing improvement in teaching practice</li>
<li>continue to deepen self review relating to teaching and learning</li>
<li>strengthen leadership across the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Kaitaia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Kaitaia will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
