At the beginning of 2012, the kindergarten opened a new purpose-built centre on the existing site. The indoor and outdoor areas are well resourced, attractive and interesting for children.</p><p align="left">The children settle quickly on arrival and play well with each other. They confidently approach their teachers and engage in extended conversations with them. The children enjoy a wide range of well-chosen resources and well-planned activities. There is a busy but very calm feel to this centre. ERO observed children having fun with each other in their play.</p><p align="left">ERO observed teachers working well as a team and teachers taking time for conversations with parents. Teachers think carefully about how they will extend their children&rsquo;s experiences, language and thinking. They seek out relevant experiences and resources. A good example of this is their present focus on science skills and scientific ways of thinking. Individual learning goals are also set for each child.</p><p align="left">Teachers work closely with several community groups. They have close links with local schools and strategies to help children and their parents take this next step. Children enjoy a range of information, communication and technology (ICT) experiences.</p><p align="left">Teachers are reflective and they constantly look for ways to improve what they do and how they could better provide for their children. They and ERO identified that their next step is to further extend the M&#257;ori dimension in their work with children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of the:</p><ul>
<li>programme provided for children;</li>
<li>learning environment</li>
<li>interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The children learn and play in a very calm and settled environment. They quickly settle on arrival and are happy for their parents to leave them. The children play well alongside and with each other. ERO observed caring and respectful relationships between teachers, parents and children</p><p align="left">Teachers know the children and their families very well. Teachers know what the learning priorities are for each child and have a shared understanding of what strategies they will use to support that child. Teachers listen to and respond to what parents want for their children.</p><p align="left">ERO noted other strengths that contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing. These include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers finding specific resources and planning specific activities to provoke and extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning</li>
<li>teachers allow children to lead their own learning and assist and extend them when appropriate</li>
<li>teachers find effective ways to encourage children&rsquo;s independence, leadership and sense of responsibility</li>
<li>a well resourced and carefully set out learning environment where children can move easily between different areas and find quiet areas for undisturbed play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers constantly review how well their programmes and practices promote children&rsquo;s interest and enthusiasm for learning, and their well being. This has led to well-informed changes and improved practices.</p><h4>Areas for review and development</h4><p align="left">The teachers and ERO have identified the following areas for review and development.</p><p align="left">Teachers need to strengthen their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori and better integrate this into the day-to-day learning and centre practices.</p><p align="left">The strategic plan needs to identify the centre&rsquo;s priorities for development.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Jonathan Rhodes Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

They have close links with local schools and strategies to help children and their parents take this next step. Children enjoy a range of information, communication and technology (ICT) experiences.</p><p align="left">Teachers are reflective and they constantly look for ways to improve what they do and how they could better provide for their children. They and ERO identified that their next step is to further extend the M&#257;ori dimension in their work with children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions. If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region&nbsp;</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
