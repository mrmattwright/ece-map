</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jonathan Rhodes Kindergarten nestles in the heart of North East Valley, Dunedin. It is in a modern purpose-built building.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for up to 40 children aged from two years to school age. It has recently changed its opening hours to align with the school day. However, some children still attend for either the morning or the afternoon. The kindergarten has stable staffing and all teachers are qualified.</p><p>The kindergarten has made positive progress on the recommendations of the 2012 ERO report. This includes the development of a strategic plan and a greater inclusion of a Māori dimension in the programme. </p><p>The kindergarten operates under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK) umbrella. DK provides management and professional support for the teachers. This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a very settled and cooperative way. The kaupapa or philosophy of Jonathan Rhodes Kindergarten is for children to become independent, resilient and socially competent. The teachers plan experiences and set up resources and the environment with these goals in mind.</p><p>The teachers listen carefully to children and seek their opinions and points of view. They have a useful system to plan for individuals and groups of children. The plans build on children’s interests and enthusiasms and set challenges for children’s learning.</p><p>The teachers value parents’ wishes for their children’s learning and invite families to bring their skills and knowledge into the kindergarten programme. The teachers have identified they could enrich the programme further through more meaningful partnerships with parents.</p><p>Children and their families have a strong sense of belonging at the kindergarten. Children have strong friendships with one another. Teachers know the families well, and are supportive and responsive to their needs.</p><p>Children and teachers have explored Māori concepts such as manaakitanga through children caring for each other and the environment. The children have learnt a kindergarten mihi and children’s own whānau mihi are valued. The children use te reo Māori through the day and the teachers are working to increase their own knowledge and confidence with te reo Māori and te ao Māori.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of experiences in the well-resourced kindergarten. Features of the programme that support children’s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>rich oral language and early-literacy experiences</li>
<li>using iPads as a tool for learning</li>
<li>exploration of the natural world</li>
<li>interesting outings in the local community and having visitors to the kindergarten</li>
<li>celebrating events such as Mātariki and Polyfest.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers make a great team. They work collaboratively and value each other’s strengths. They share common understandings about what is important for children and their families. They reflect on their practice and actively seek professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers have a good idea of what they want for the future of the kindergarten. Their ideas have been developed into a strategic plan which shows the priorities and actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Related systems such as professional learning, appraisal, self-review topics and senior teacher support should align with the strategic focus. The teachers are developing their understanding of self-review.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>When teachers next review the kindergarten philosophy it would be useful if their beliefs were stated more clearly. This would enable them to evaluate more efficiently how well they are meeting their expectations for children’s learning.</p><p>The teachers with the support of their senior teacher should also continue to:</p><ul>
<li>create closer partnerships with parents in setting learning goals for children</li>
<li>increase their knowledge and skills around te ao Māori and Māori perspectives</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of effective self-review including use of evaluative questions and robust indicators.</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive are evaluative, show how well the DK’s vision and goals are met, and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent high quality practice across all kindergartens within the DK.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jonathan Rhodes Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jonathan Rhodes Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>4 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
