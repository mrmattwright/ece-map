</table><p>Maungawhau Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maungawhau Playcentre in Mt Eden is run as a family cooperative, providing five sessions each week for children up to school age. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children up to the age of two years. Since the 2015 ERO review, this centre has merged with a nearby Playcentre.</p><p>Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning together. The centre's philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children and promotes social opportunities for children and families. Sessions are guided <em>by Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive reports. Positive features identified in the 2015 ERO report continue to be strongly evident. Recommendations for enhancing practice in 2015 included strengthening self review, bicultural practices, assessment, planning and evaluation. Centre members have responded very positively to these recommendations.</p><p>The new Playcentre Aotearoa structure is now fully operational. It provides a sound management framework and support personnel to help parents/whƒÅnau to manage their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres‚Äô funding and provides adult education programmes for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The learning environment is attractive and well resourced. Centre members' strengths and skills are complementary and enable them to provide a range of interesting activities to link in with the natural world. Parents/whƒÅnau encourage physically active and challenging play. Children use the extensive indoor and outdoor areas well and experience a full range of learning opportunities that provide a wide scope for imaginative and collaborative play.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau are a positive, guiding presence. They follow children's lead as they engage in play, responding to their conversations and providing extra resources that might bring more complexity to their thinking. Adults model oral language well, through sharing stories and conversations. They extend children's vocabulary as opportunities arise through their responses to children's interests.</p><p>Playcentre's 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi' philosophical approach is reflected in centre members' commitment to incorporating bicultural practices in programmes for their children. There is very effective centre leadership for this focus. Parents/whƒÅnau are becoming more confident to include te reo and waiata MƒÅori incidentally in sessions. There are good resources within the centre to help extend centre members' knowledge of te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>Children's portfolios reflect the Playcentre philosophy, valuing parents as first teachers. Portfolios provide good records of children's learning over time. Learning stories celebrate each child as a member of a family and the wider Playcentre whƒÅnau. Identifying the relevant links between children's learning and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> would help to strengthen these records.</p><p>Centre members have adopted planned approaches to implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. They make decisions collectively at regular meetings. Centre members have developed strategic and annual planning to guide their progress. Internal evaluation leads to change and improvement. Centre members who are engaged in higher levels of Playcentre adult education are guiding the further development of internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the use of the language of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> in documentation, to better reflect planning, assessment and evaluation discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for development in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of internal evaluation to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the region.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungawhau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>17 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
