<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Selwyn Park Kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). The kindergarten caters for up to 30 children and offers four school-day sessions and one half-day session for children from Dargaville and the surrounding areas. NKA support staff have worked consistently with staff since the 2009 ERO report to upgrade the indoor and outdoor learning environments. The centre is now an attractive and functional place for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>A professional practice manager (PPM) from NKA, provides professional support and advice to staff to encourage the development of high quality teaching and learning programmes and effective administration systems. The head teacher, who was new at the time of the 2009 review, has settled well into her role. NKA has provided her with professional training to continue to develop the skills needed to lead the staff team.</p><p>There is a high number of M&#257;ori children enrolled at the kindergarten. Children from P&#257;keh&#257;, Pacific and Asian backgrounds also attend. Children are very settled and engaged in the programme. They show high levels of independence and are articulate communicators. Children display developing levels of social competence.</p><p>Teachers have developed inclusive relationships with wh&#257;nau. M&#257;ori language, tikanga and beliefs are highly valued within daily kindergarten practice. Children and teachers interact freely with each other as do parents and teachers. Teachers provide support to parents that is appropriate and relevant to individual family circumstances.</p><p>Staff work well as a team. The administrator fulfils her role efficiently and provides valuable support to the teaching team. Teachers have reorganised learning environments to make resources more accessible to children, encourage their independent exploration, and to help them to follow their particular learning interests. Teachers consider how they can further extend children&rsquo;s learning. They reflect on their teaching practice and engage in professional discussions based on current theories and research.</p><p>ERO recommends that teachers now review and refine curriculum planning practices to add complexity to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Selwyn Park Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSelwyn Park Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>At the time of the 2009 ERO report, the kindergarten had just begun providing longer sessions for four days of the week and retained one half-day session per week. Increased numbers of staff improved opportunities for teachers to work more closely with wh&#257;nau and children.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Competent children.</em> Children are independent learners who capably facilitate their own play. Their ability to negotiate positive outcomes, compromise and manage their relationships with other children, is evident. They interact confidently with adults and have developed firm friendships with their peers. Children are respectful and display a strong sense of responsibility for the care of one another and the learning environment.</p><p>Positive relationships between wh&#257;nau and staff. Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for children and their wh&#257;nau. Relationships are trusting and respectful. Children, parents and teachers communicate with one another openly. Parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children are noted by teachers and are incorporated in to planning.</p><p><em>Teaching practice.</em> Teachers have built sound relationships with the kindergarten&rsquo;s community. They engage in conversations frequently with children and use resources to prompt thinking. They stimulate children&rsquo;s learning by asking openended questions, and promote children&rsquo;s ability to reason and solve problems. Teachers are responsive to new ideas and are open to learning new skills.</p><p><em>Tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori.</em> Children are continuously developing a deepening competency in the use and understanding of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Children greet their friends and teachers in the M&#257;ori language and mihi to visitors. Parents like the fact that their children are learning to speak in both the M&#257;ori and English languages. Children are beginning to display the ability to translate phrases, words and numbers spontaneously between languages. Teachers model man&#257;kitanga (hospitality), whakawh&#257;ungatanga (building family connections) and te reo for children.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> Teachers use self-review procedures effectively to bring about improvement. Where needed, they introduce theoretical foundations and research articles to guide positive change. They have produced effective annual and strategic planning which is used to identify areas for improvement.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Add complexity to the quality of learning. Teachers should add complexity to learning by:</p><ul>
<li>reading more frequently to children and providing opportunities for children to participate in small group discussions</li>
<li>researching with children and demonstrating how they can use science resources to increase their knowledge about the scientific world</li>
<li>reviewing the learning environment to ensure children experience a broad range of areas of play.</li>
</ul><p>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau. Teachers could consider working with wh&#257;nau to develop a shared understanding of how children learn and the role of family in supporting that learning. They could also better support children&rsquo;s move into the school environment by strengthening transition to school procedures.</p><p><em>Curriculum planning.</em> Teachers could consider:</p><ul>
<li>the benefits of using different types of record keeping to support planning for learning</li>
<li>adding parent and child voice to curriculum planning processes</li>
<li>identifying what the necessary components of learning stories are for assessing and planning possible next steps for learning</li>
<li>ensuring that planning demonstrates linked progressions of children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Philosophy. Teachers should review the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and add indicators of good practice to define focus areas identified within the philosophy statement.</p><p>Improvement to self review. Teachers could revisit the Ministry of Education selfreview guidelines to help them consider ways to document reviews more precisely.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Selwyn Park Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>display and analyse the hazard list</li>
<li>analyse accident documentation.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO, teachers and the professional practice manager agree that teachers should review and refine curriculum planning practices to add complexity to and extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>19 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-selwyn-park-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Selwyn Park Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Selwyn Park Kindergarten.</p><p>Selwyn Park Kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). The kindergarten caters for up to 30 children and offers four school-day sessions and one half-day session for children from Dargaville and the surrounding areas. NKA support staff have worked consistently with staff since the 2009 ERO report to upgrade the indoor and outdoor learning environments. The centre is now an attractive and functional place for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>A professional practice manager (PPM) from NKA, provides professional support and advice to staff to encourage the development of high quality teaching and learning programmes and effective administration systems. The head teacher, who was new at the time of the 2009 review, has settled well into her role. NKA has provided her with professional training to continue to develop the skills needed to lead the staff team.</p><p>There is a high number of M&#257;ori children enrolled at the kindergarten. Children from P&#257;keh&#257;, Pacific and Asian backgrounds also attend. Children are very settled and engaged in the programme. They show high levels of independence and are articulate communicators. Children display developing levels of social competence.</p><p>Teachers have developed inclusive relationships with wh&#257;nau. M&#257;ori language, tikanga and beliefs are highly valued within daily kindergarten practice. Children and teachers interact freely with each other as do parents and teachers. Teachers provide support to parents that is appropriate and relevant to individual family circumstances.</p><p>Staff work well as a team. The administrator fulfils her role efficiently and provides valuable support to the teaching team. Teachers have reorganised learning environments to make resources more accessible to children, encourage their independent exploration, and to help them to follow their particular learning interests. Teachers consider how they can further extend children&rsquo;s learning. They reflect on their teaching practice and engage in professional discussions based on current theories and research.</p><p>ERO recommends that teachers now review and refine curriculum planning practices to add complexity to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
