</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children‚Äôs Education Centre is a well established service that operates within the grounds of the Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT). It provides full day care mostly for the children of students and staff at the Institute, and also welcomes a small group of children from the local community. The cultural diversity of families and staff is celebrated as a valued feature of the centre. Children benefit from the large team of qualified and experienced staff.</p><p>Prior to 2012, the service operated as two centres that separated infants and toddlers from children over two years old. In 2012 the two centres were merged under one licence for 90 children, although both areas have continued to function separately. This is the first ERO review of the centre under the combined licence.</p><p>MIT provides management and personnel systems to support the centre but delegates daily administration to a centre manager. She is assisted by an administrator and two team leaders who are taking increasing responsibility for the teachers in their areas. The centre philosophy is focused on the uniqueness of each child. This focus is supported by a primary caregiver system that encourages closer partnerships between children, key teachers and families.</p><p>Previous ERO reviews have identified positive and trusting relationships between children and staff. ERO noted that good quality programmes that incorporated the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy underpinned a focus on early literacy, numeracy and science. Flexible routines and responsive interactions supported the nurturing care of infants and toddlers. These good practices continue to be features of the service and reflect the centre philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and settled in the centre. They benefit from positive relationships with teachers and from tuakana/teina opportunities to learn alongside their peers. Children are busy, often independent learners who confidently access resources and enjoy the challenges of an extensive, inviting outdoor environment. Many engage well in meaningful conversations with adults and work cooperatively to share resources and play together in small groups.</p><p>A particularly calm environment for infants and toddlers encourages their social development and fosters their exploration of resources. Children are supported well through teachers‚Äô extensive knowledge of their families and cultures, relaxed routines for care, and the sensitive transitions throughout the centre. In this environment children show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers consistently support children's play. They engage children in conversations about their interests and ask questions that prompt ideas for play. Within the primary caregiver structure teachers know children very well and encourage individual interests. They celebrate children's diversity and have engaged in professional development to help with their support for children with special needs. A newly appointed team leader has a special interest in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. She plans to focus on developing teachers‚Äô skills to enhance the success of MƒÅori children as MƒÅori.</p><p>Primary caregivers plan programmes for their individual groups. Programmes for older children often explore group interests while infant and toddler programmes focus more on individual developmental tasks and early socialisation. Many teachers record children's learning well in narrative assessments but, as a team, staff recognise that the quality and continuity in their learning stories needs further development. As the three older groups all share the same play area and work with all adults, it may be useful for teachers to collaborate more in their planning, and to re-establish their on-line discussions so that they can share learning progress more effectively.</p><p>Parent surveys indicate enthusiastic support for the centre. Parents are very positive about teaching practices, the services provided for children, cultural recognition, and communication strategies. Families express a sense of belonging in the centre and appreciate the information they receive about the programme and children's learning. Parents have opportunities to be involved in the centre through a parent committee, excursions and consultation processes.</p><p>MIT supports the centre well. It provides considerable internal professional learning for staff and encourages individual training initiatives. The centre manager liaises with MIT to provide appropriate appraisal processes for teachers and to manage the appointment and induction of staff. She fosters mentoring and peer support among teachers.</p><p>The centre manager has guided reviews of several centre practices and each of the teaching teams has review processes in place. While these support positive outcomes, there is a need to strengthen self review in order to improve the centre‚Äôs management framework and to enhance the teaching focus on extended learning for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager, team leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing development of self-review processes to improve policies and to evaluate all aspects of teaching and learning</li>
<li>using the manager‚Äôs SWOT analysis process to continue the development and implementation of strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>continuing the focus on programme management so that planning, assessment and evaluation build consistently and effectively on children's interests and the complexity of their play</li>
<li>strengthening teachers‚Äô understanding of their roles in extending children‚Äôs learning so that they can develop planning beyond the provision of resources and activities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manukau Institute of Technology Children's Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Manukau Institute of Technology Children's Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 June 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
