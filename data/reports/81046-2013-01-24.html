<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Weston Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Weston Playcentre is one of 37 playcentres administered by the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). It is one of four playcentres centres in the Oamaru region. These four centres have close and supportive links with each other.</p><p>Weston Playcentre is situated in a semi-rural setting next door to the local school and many families attending are farmers. The centre is open five mornings a week and offers programmes for children from birth to five years. The sessions are run by educators and parents who have completed the necessary playcentre training. There are good numbers of parents in training for playcentre qualifications. Most children attend only the playcentre and stay until they start school.</p><p>The playcentre has recently been relicensed under the 2008 licensing requirements. The parents have recently refurbished the outside deck area to make an all-weather play space.</p><p>The parents and educators have made very good progress in addressing the recommendations outlined in the 2009 Education Review Report.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the OPA umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in attractive and well-resourced indoor and outdoor settings. The centre resources are beautifully presented and well organised. Children can easily access these resources.</p><p>Many of the parents stay to settle their children and spend the session working alongside them. The education team gives clear direction to the parent helpers on the day and there are clear expectations of the parent help role.</p><p>Children benefit from many genuine conversations with the educators and parents. These conversations support children in their play and extend their thinking. Children play well with and alongside each other. Children stay for long periods of time at activities. They are encouraged and supported by parents and educators to make choices and be independent.</p><p>A feature of this centre is the strong routines and the useful learning that occurs through these times. Children are very familiar with the routines such as morning tea and group times where children can share news, sing familiar songs and practise letters and numbers.</p><p>The educators and parents have well established systems to identify children&rsquo;s next steps for learning. Many of the parents share their aspirations and goals for their children. These goals are displayed on the centre notice board. The education team actively seek to involve parents in planning for their children. They have systems for adding to the children&rsquo;s profile books. The profile books are attractive records of what children do at playcentre. These books are easily accessible to the children and their parents.</p><p>The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>make better and more frequent use of individual children&rsquo;s goals and aspirations when planning programmes</li>
<li>use these goals as the starting point to develop strategies (including interactions) and experiences to build on and extend individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>use the aspirations and goals to guide what the educators and parents will write about to show progress being made in respect of these.</li>
</ul><p>Educators have a group plan to guide the term's activities. The term plan includes a specific focus on the integration of te reo M&#257;ori, learning about M&#257;ori myths and legends celebrating M&#257;tariki. In 2012 educators and parents have planned a wide range of activities and trips to broaden children&rsquo;s knowledge and skills. The next step is for educators and parents to:</p><ul>
<li>consider how they might better integrate individual children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and abilities within the group plan.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has established strong links with the local school. Children are well supported in their transition to school.</p><p>The parents and educators use spontaneous self review to make changes to the resources and environment. In-depth review is still a work in progress. The next step is for parents and educators continue to develop their use and understanding of in-depth reviews and how they gather multiple perspectives.</p><p>The centre is well supported by the centre advisor and has had good support from the Otago Playcentre Association during the relicensing process earlier in 2012.</p><h3>Governance and Management</h3><p>The OPA provides a comprehensive range of support to this and other playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing an action plan for all centres to be relicensed with the 2008 Regulations</li>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing support for employment processes</li>
<li>targeted support for playcentres requiring additional assistance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>The OPA executive and personnel hold regular meetings with a specific focus on each centre. They discuss best ways to support individual centres. Records from these meetings could be more specific about what support is provided and the difference it has made.</p><p>A strength of the OPA is the ongoing support provided by the centre advisors. The centre advisor effectively supports the parents and educators in developing their understanding of planning, assessment and self review.</p><p>Centre advisors should continue to build their knowledge and understanding of self review. They should use each centre's self review as evidence to assure the governors of the OPA how well the playcentre is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>OPA personnel need to further develop their understanding of self review and use the findings of self review to assure themselves of the effectiveness of their strategic goals and all aspects of the OPA management and operations.</p><p>The OPA governors have a sound policy framework to support the playcentre.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Weston Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>24 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
