</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bell Block Childcare is licensed to provide all-day education and care for up to 35 children, including eight up to the age of two years, at any one time. The service is governed by a parent committee which supports centre operations, property management and future improvements.</p><p>A centre manager has oversight of the day-to-day operations and a head teacher oversees curriculum development and implementation and provides professional leadership to the teaching team. The service sustains a high proportion of long serving staff. Of the eight teachers employed, seven hold current practising certificates with the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO report noted assessment, planning and evaluation as requiring further development. ERO's evaluation also identified the incorporation of bicultural practice and the effective use of self review as priorities for development. Teaching staff responded positively to the findings and accessed external professional development to improve these aspects of practice.</p><p>The Ministry of Education is providing professional learning support to the governance body to understand their roles and responsibilities. Governance members and centre leaders are also receiving external support to develop strategic and annual plans that give priority to curriculum development and provide a useful framework for evaluating the service's performance.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning and development is enhanced through their active exploration and engagement with the wide range of planned and spontaneous learning experiences available. They play amicably alongside their peers.</p><p>Inclusive practices are evident. Interactions between children and with staff are warm and respectful. Parents and whānau take the opportunity to be involved in the centre and increasingly their children's learning. These factors contribute positively to a family-focused calm, unhurried atmosphere and children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. </p><p>The allocation of teachers to specific age groups supports relationship-based teaching practice. Attentive teachers know children well. They provide timely support, and children enjoy sustained interactions with their key teachers. This is particularly notable in the responsive nurture given to the service's youngest children.</p><p>The principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to meaningful inclusion of te ao Māori are reflected in the centre philosophy and practice. Assessment practice and the curriculum respond well to children's interests, skills development and when appropriate identified needs.</p><p>Teachers create learning profiles for individuals. Increasingly learning stories demonstrate teachers' understanding of individual and groups of children's learning progress. However, evaluation of the effectiveness of curriculum decision making continues to need improvement.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should build their understanding of effective internal evaluation to sustain the good practice occurring and give priority to planning for ongoing improvement. Self review for accountability and practices to promote a safe emotional and physical learning environment are well embedded. Processes to evaluate the impact of teaching and the curriculum on progressing children's learning are less developed and as a consequence not well implemented.</p><p>Leaders have identified strengthening appraisal practice as a next step for development. The head teacher has undertaken professional development to build her leadership ability in this area.</p><p>More professional development and change is planned for 2017. This includes incorporating <em>Tātaiako</em>: <em>Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> in to all teachers' appraisals to build their knowledge and to provide an evidence base of how well teachers support Māori leaners and their whānau. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is a need to build leadership capacity to enable the service to sustain and continually improve outcomes for children. Priorities for development are in leading:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' ongoing professional learning through rigorous appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective internal evaluation of the curriculum and service philosophy. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bell Block Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bell Block Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>24 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
