</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Kaikorai is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. It provides full-day education and care for up to 75 children from 3 months to school age. Children learn in three classrooms and progress through these depending on their age.</p><p>The service is led by a centre manager and three head teachers. A BestStart Business Manager and BestStart Professional Services Manager visit regularly to support the service. There is a mix of qualified teachers and caregivers. The manager is new since the last education review in 2016.</p><p>The centre's vision for teaching and learning is that it is `meaningful, collaborative, respectful and fun'.</p><p>Good progress has been made on most of the areas identified for improvement in the last review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leadership is very effectively building positive conditions for teaching and learning by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>creating commitment to a shared vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership capacity across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setting and modelling clear expectations for teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building a positive and professional team culture.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These developments have resulted in increased confidence, collaboration and engagement across teaching teams which has led to more purposeful learning opportunities for children. Leaders are establishing effective systems and processes to sustain these conditions and to promote consistent centre-wide practices.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is increasingly evident and guiding practice. Leaders agree that they need to make the valued outcomes for children more explicit in the philosophy.¬†</p><p>Children's interests, strengths and needs are the basis of their learning. Teachers know individual children well and are intentionally planning to support their ongoing development. They nurture children's social and emotional and physical development by the way they relate to them and purposefully arrange the environment and resources. There is a clear focus on encouraging children's initiative and independence.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from warm, responsive and respectful interactions with teachers. They build genuine attachments to `key teachers' which promote their sense of security. Their learning environment is accessible, well-resourced and thoughtfully set up to promote exploration and challenge.</p><p>Teachers have built their knowledge, awareness and confidence in including aspects of te ao MƒÅori within the daily programme. As a result MƒÅori children regularly experience aspects of their language and culture. The culture, language and identity of all children and their families are highly valued and included in centre programmes and celebrations.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are developing strong partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. They actively seek, value and respond to parent and whƒÅnau wishes for their children's learning and development. Parents have many opportunities to learn about what happens for their children in their learning and to give feedback about what is important to them in centre operations. Teachers work closely with families and other specialists to plan and respond to the needs of children with additional needs.</p><p>Teachers use assessment effectively to show what children know, are interested in and can do. Increasingly, they are using assessment information well to identify children's progress and next steps on their learning pathways. The next step for teachers and leaders is to better use assessment information to evaluate the impact of their teaching.</p><p>There are well-developed systems and processes in place to help the service achieve BestStart expectations for high quality education and care. This includes regular monitoring of and support for the quality of practice and identifying what is going well and what the service needs to do next to improve. Leaders and teachers have been building their understandings of effective internal evaluation. There are meaningful staff appraisal practices in place. Professional learning is promoted at all levels of the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are for leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop teachers' capability to extend children's thinking, knowledge and vocabulary through rich interactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly identify valued outcomes for children in the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop teacher and centre-wide practices for inquiry and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make the links to practicing teacher criteria in the appraisal process more explicit.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Kaikorai Valley completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Kaikorai Valley will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>28 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
