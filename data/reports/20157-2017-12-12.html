</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Small is Beautiful is a well established, privately owned centre in Devonport. It provides morning and afternoon sessions for up to 20 children. Some stay for hours that are similar to a school day. The majority of children are from the local community and many have siblings who have previously attended the centre. The centre is staffed by four qualified teachers, including the centre owner/manager.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified good practices that have been maintained. Teachers continue to work collaboratively and share a philosophical belief that learning should be generated by the richness of activities available for children. The 2014 report identified areas for development relating to the use of assessment and planning, bicultural practices and self review. Since 2014, teachers have engaged in external professional development to enhance their practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, capable, and caring. They show respect, kindness, and concern for their peers. They are developing a sense of personal and social responsibility. Children approach teachers with trust and affection when requiring reassurance or assistance.</p><p>Responsive and caring relationships contribute positively to children‚Äôs emotional wellbeing and sense of belonging. Teachers know children and their families very well, and encourage children to share their home languages. Children with learning challenges are identified, supported, and referred to specialist agencies when necessary. Teachers are inclusive of children with varying abilities, and maintain the dignity of the child at all times.</p><p>Children learn in a home-like, attractive environment that is well resourced and reflects their ideas and interests. They have fun and are purposefully engaged. They play cooperatively and explore at their own pace. Teachers support children to develop the skills and dispositions of a successful learner.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to include literacy, mathematics and science as part of their play and discussions. Children are encouraged to be creative and expressive through art, music, dance and dramatic play. There is good provision for physical development.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations and view all children as competent learners. The centre‚Äôs philosophy, and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, inform the programme and teaching practices. Teachers have good knowledge about developmentally appropriate practices. They support children sensitively to engage in planned activities and encourage them to make choices.</p><p>Parent involvement is welcomed. Frequent communications with parents keep them well informed about their children‚Äôs progress. Teachers have strong links with community groups, outside agencies and other education services. Supporting children to have a smooth transition to school continues to be a much valued feature of the centre. Parents are highly appreciative of the education and care their children receive, and are very supportive of the teachers.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô commitment to biculturalism is reflected in the centre environment, and has been supported by extensive professional development. Teachers and children use words and phrases of te reo MƒÅori in routines and conversations. They show respect for tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. They are enthusiastic about professional development and contributing to internal evaluation. Performance management practices promote quality teaching. The supportive working environment and staff stability also have a positive impact on programmes and outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre owner provides strong professional leadership. Managers make good use of research to inform their strategic direction and policies. There is a strong alignment between the centre vision, philosophy and strategic plans. There are well established management and administration systems.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>exploring ways to more consistently record how teachers extend children‚Äôs thinking and how individual interests are developed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing more evaluative processes that involve deeper analysis, and focus on the effectiveness of teacher practices and their impact on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Small is Beautiful Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety, and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Small is Beautiful Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>12 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
