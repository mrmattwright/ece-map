</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>White Heron Learning Centre - Otara is licensed to provide early childhood education for up to 35 children, including up to 10 under two years of age. The centre operates from one building on an attractive well maintained site. Children play in age-related groups in two separate areas. Most children who attend identify as Samoan. The centre has a strong focus on gagana Samoa.</p><p>The White Heron Learning Centre - Otara is one of four privately owned centres. The licensee has developed policies and procedures to guide centre operations. A new supervisor manages the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy highlights the importance of children‚Äôs diversity, and their cultural and social backgrounds, recognising the special qualities of every child who attends the service. The curriculum reflects the interests of the children and the aspirations of parents and aiga.</p><p>The 2011 ERO review recommended that centre managers use external professional support to develop a long-term strategic plan, promote programmes that extend children‚Äôs emerging interests, and further improve self-review practices. Centre members continue to address these recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and happy in the centre. They interact positively with one another and have a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. They have access to a range of activities and experiences and work well together independently and in small groups. They are confident to explore their surroundings and experiment with the resources available to them. Teachers encourage children‚Äôs participation in activities.</p><p>Teachers value the language, heritage and cultures of all children and their families. Relationships between teachers, children, parents and aiga are strong. Parents are encouraged to be active partners in their children‚Äôs learning. Teachers keep families well informed about the programme through learning stories and regular discussions.</p><p>The teacher-led programmes are presented in a variety of ways to prompt children‚Äôs interests. Teachers plan the programmes and resources around themes and interests. They include daily activities that focus on literacy and mathematics. Children‚Äôs play shows that they have multiple ideas and interests. The challenge for teachers is to consistently provide learning extension and to consider the potential for children‚Äôs learning experiences when setting up the learning environment.</p><p>Teachers have made good use of a Ministry of Education supported professional development programme to develop children‚Äôs early concepts about literacy and mathematics through music. Children and teachers have many valuable opportunities to learn and perform a diverse range of songs in Samoan, MƒÅori and English. Respect for biculturalism is evident in the centre environment and in centre practices. Some teachers confidently take responsibility for integrating waiata and te reo MƒÅori into the programme.</p><p>Teachers plan their programmes, evaluate the learning that has taken place for children, and write an assessment in the children‚Äôs portfolios. Centre leaders have identified the need for teachers to reflect on their teaching and to link appraisal to expectations of effective teaching practice. They need to strengthen links in their teaching to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified the need to improve the quality of teaching practice. A restructuring of the supervisor network within the White Heron Learning Centre management is likely to strengthen professional guidance, curriculum advice, and mentoring for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>Leaders should ensure teachers can achieve a more child-centred programme designed to challenge children and promote learning. Centre leaders and ERO agree that important next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing centre-wide expectations that promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of the teacher‚Äôs role in supporting learning through child-directed play</li>
<li>continuing with the development of the teacher appraisal process to further encourage teachers‚Äô reflection about the impact of their teaching on children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>refining self-review practices through the use of specific criteria to help measure effectiveness</li>
<li>responding to children as capable and competent learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of White Heron Learning Centre - Otara completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of White Heron Learning Centre - Otara will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
