</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (211) is very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (211) Avonhead is one of 12 early childhood education and care centres in Christchurch owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The centre operates under the Kindercare philosophy, and management and accountability systems. An area manager works in partnership with centre leaders to guide the effective operation of each centre.</p><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (211) Avonhead is a purpose-built centre in the heart of Avonhead. It serves a diverse and culturally rich community. Many of the staff represent the home cultures of the children and families that attend the centre.</p><p>The centre provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age, in five separate rooms. These rooms are specifically designed to meet the developing needs of different age groups of children.</p><p>Most staff have been at the centre for a long period of time and are qualified and registered teachers. The leadership team, including a curriculum advisor, has worked together for a number of years. An on-site cook provides nutritious vegetarian meals and snacks for children.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have continued to sustain and build on many of the strengths outlined in the 2014 ERO report. There is a specific focus, service wide, on parent-education training to provide useful, informed support to families. Leaders are developing links with local schools to help support transition to school processes for children.</p><p>The leadership team has made good progress in addressing the recommendations from the previous review. This includes recent developments in assessment, planning and evaluation, placing an increasing focus on bicultural perspectives, and aligning self review to centre and curriculum priorities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 Kindercare Learning Centres reviewed in the Christchurch area in Term 1 2017.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers foster positive, inclusive, reciprocal relationships with children and families. They have a strong, shared vision and philosophy that support children to be ‘safe, loved and learning’ within well organised, purposefully presented learning environments. Children and families are well supported to make a positive transition into the centre and between rooms.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are respectful and sensitive to children’s home languages, cultures and identities. They are developing the use of te reo and tikanga Māori to provide a more bicultural curriculum for children. Teachers make meaningful connections with families and foster a good sense of wellbeing and belonging for them and their children. Significant cultural events and resources are an integral part of centre programmes. Children are encouraged to value their own and other cultures.</p><p>Leaders and teachers model care and respect for one another and for children. They place importance on promoting children’s social and emotional skills to help children develop a positive sense of themselves and the ability to initiate and maintain friendships.</p><p>Children in the under-two year old area are well supported by teachers who foster secure relationships through positive and responsive interactions. They have many opportunities to explore and make discoveries within a creative and stimulating environment. A curriculum of care provides a strong focus on children's wellbeing and personalised, respectful routines.</p><p>Children across the centre are actively involved in a wide range of interesting learning experiences that capture their curiosity and imagination. They are encouraged to be independent and confident about being involved in challenging physical activities and creative experiences. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into the programme in ways that are meaningful for children’s learning.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children’s learning interests through well-written learning records, the use of digital technologies, and regular conversations with teachers.</p><p>The centre is very well led and managed by an experienced and supportive leadership team. The unique strengths of teachers are well used to build on the skills of others such as increasing cultural competencies to respond to the diverse home cultures of children and families. Teachers attend regular professional learning and development to build on teaching practices and evaluation processes. Teachers' leadership and teaching potential are recognised and fostered through regular coaching and mentoring aligned to appraisal processes.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers work collaboratively to successfully implement Kindercare management, curriculum, and health and safety systems. They have developed a very reflective and evaluative team culture where teachers regularly discuss ways to continually improve learning and teaching practices.</p><p>Centre leaders have a strategic approach to the operation of the centre and to managing change and improvements to practices. A comprehensive, systematic self-review process is well aligned to centre priorities that are focused on ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team has identified and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that in order to build on the good practices that are evident, the key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural perspectives and practices</li>
<li>all teachers' capability to lead in-depth self review</li>
<li>new assessment processes across the teaching team.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd could consider:</p><ul>
<li>giving greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in key documentation</li>
<li>further developing strategic and annual action planning at centre level</li>
<li>formalising and documenting the procedure for appraisal and attestation in the Christchurch area</li>
<li>strengthening partnerships in learning with schools</li>
<li>evaluating how effectively current learning records provide opportunities for children to revisit their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres Avonhead (211) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres Avonhead (211) will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>13 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
