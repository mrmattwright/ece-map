</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Chapel Hill Kindergarten, located in the north east of Hamilton, provides education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of a charitable trust and is licensed for 40 children. The roll of 89 includes nine Māori children. The kindergarten's roll is multicultural with over ten different nationalities represented. It operates flexible hours with a combination of full day, morning or afternoon sessions. Many children attend the kindergarten on a part-time basis.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review leadership and staffing at the kindergarten have remained consistent. A new supervisor has been appointed to work alongside the experienced kindergarten manager to manage the kindergarten and provide professional leadership for the staff. At the beginning of 2016 the governance structure of the kindergarten changed. The management committee was disbanded and overall governance of the kindergarten is now provided by the trust. The trust continues to employ qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten's mission is to provide a programme that is based on Christian teaching values. Its philosophy is for children to be confident, competent life-long learners who are inquisitive about the world around them.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Staff have responded to the area for development in the 2013 ERO report relating to the multi-cultural nature of the kindergarten community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Chapel Hill Kindergarten is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from positive and caring relationships with their teachers. These relationships contribute to their wellbeing and belonging. Their sense of confidence and competence is supported by teachers' use of a wide range of effective teaching strategies. Māori children's language, culture and identity is recognised and acknowledged through teachers increased use of te reo Māori in their daily interactions, karakia at meal times, and the regular use of waiata. Well-known values that reflect the kindergarten's Christian philosophy contribute to children's growing self-management and self-help skills.</p><p>The kindergarten's programme strongly reflects its Christian special character. Leaders are considering implementing a more child-initiated programme that is more flexible and responsive to children's emerging interests. The current programme includes many teacher-led routines and activities. Positive features of the programme experienced by children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ready access to a wide range of good-quality resources and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities to interact with the natural world especially the kindergarten's pets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>frequent visits into the local and wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular celebrations that reflect the multi-cultural nature of the kindergarten community.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has an inclusive approach for children with diverse learning and behaviour needs. Leaders seek appropriate external support where required and work in collaboration with families to achieve positive outcomes.</p><p>Parents are actively included and involved in the life of the kindergarten. They have opportunities to meet formally with teachers twice a year to discuss their children's learning and progress. These partnerships are further strengthened by ready access to online portfolios that capture children's involvement in the programme. These individual digital portfolios effectively identify children's emerging interests, learning and development. Teachers should give consideration to how children can more readily access and revisit this valuable record of their learning.</p><p>Children and their families benefit from flexible, well-managed transition processes into the kindergarten. Leaders and teachers have established useful relationships with the local primary school that support children as they move on to school.</p><p>The well-respected kindergarten manager and supervisor provide an informed approach to leadership of the kindergarten. They have focused on building teacher capability to provide a more child-initiated programme. Leaders demonstrate their commitment to the kindergarten's special Christian character. They promote positive relationships with staff, trustees, families and children that contribute to the kindergarten's positive culture for learning. Leaders are continuing to develop useful self-review practices to inform decision making and ongoing development.</p><p>Trustees are continuing to provide supportive governance for the kindergarten focused on positive outcomes for children. They are also strongly committed to the kindergarten's special Christian character and providing equitable outcomes for all families. Trustees fund generous professional learning opportunities for teachers and employing registered and fully qualified teaching staff. Trustees and leaders should consider consulting with parents and teachers to develop a more specific strategic plan to guide ongoing kindergarten development and self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for kindergarten leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>access centre-wide ongoing professional learning for teachers to develop an agreed understanding of effective teaching practices within a child-initiated curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to ensure teachers receive regular and robust feedback about the effectiveness of their teaching practices and meet Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The trust and kindergarten leaders access external professional development for teachers to strengthen their shared understanding of effective teaching practice within a child-initiated programme.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Chapel Hill Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Chapel Hill Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>11 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
