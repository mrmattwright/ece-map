</table><p>Requires further development</p><p>To improve centre professional leadership, teaching practice, assessment planning and evaluation of the programme and self-review systems and processes.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p><em>‚Äú</em><em>Huakina mai ki a mƒÅtou katoa to kuaha o te mƒÅtauranga me te maramatanga kia koi ai o matua hinengaro i ngƒÅ wƒÅ katoa.‚Äù</em></p><p>A whakataukƒ´ gifted to the centre expresses the aspiration to open the door of learning so that minds may be sharp at all times.</p><p>ABC Rotorua Sunset is located in Sunset Road, Rotorua. The centre is licensed to provide a choice of all day and sessional education and care for 55 children including 15 under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review there were 67 children, including 12 children under two years old, 45 who identified as MƒÅori and a number of children from other ethnic groups. The under-two area is separate from and adjacent to the area for older children, each led by a head teacher.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support underpinned by Kidicorp‚Äôs clear vision and values. They undertake well-developed and rigorous self review and quality-assurance processes, as well as providing professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel.</p><p>Since the ERO review in March 2012, a new professional services manager (PSM) was appointed in June 2014. The head teacher has remained in her role and two teachers have joined the teaching team. Since the very recent resignation of the centre manager, the PSM has acted quickly to appoint a new centre manager and provide induction and support for her.</p><p>The PSM has identified important areas for review and development to improve outcomes for children and their families. He has implemented action plans and professional support to raise the quality of professional leadership, teaching practice, bicultural practice and communication systems in the centre.</p><p>The spacious outdoor areas are about to undergo extensive remodelling to provide children with further opportunities to learn and play in a natural environment. This is likely to provide improved visibility, access and transitions between the two age-based areas.</p><p>Good use is made of the complimentary centre van, without which some children would not be able to attend this centre.</p><p>An important next step is to review the centre philosophy in consultation with all staff and families. This is likely to lead to greater ownership and a clearer sense of direction for centre development. The centre‚Äôs current philosophy aims to educate and nurture each child and provide a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are learning in a secure home-like environment with well known routines and an appropriate range of equipment. Children enjoy playing and learning alongside their siblings and other friends. Teachers present materials that foster children‚Äôs emerging interests in literacy and mathematics learning. Trips and excursions to places of significance to local MƒÅori extend children‚Äôs knowledge of their local community and the wider world.</p><p>The head teacher in the under two area is providing effective leadership. Infants and toddlers are experiencing high-quality care and learning.</p><p>ERO observed the following good practices by some teachers in both areas:</p><ul>
<li>strong, trusting relationships evident amongst teachers, children and families</li>
<li>the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices</li>
<li>mathematical concepts and early literacy evident in teacher conversations and activities</li>
<li>caregiving that promotes strong and secure attachments for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>use of rich language and responsiveness to infants non-verbal cues.</li>
</ul><p>The consistent implementation of good teaching practices by all teachers should support the centre's philosophy and aspirations for high-quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the PSM have identified the need to build leadership capability in the centre. Aspects to develop and strengthen are:</p><ul>
<li>consistent day-to-day management and implementation of key centre operations</li>
<li>the provision of clear, appropriate and well-understood expectations</li>
<li>effective performance management of staff</li>
<li>centre self-review systems and processes that consistently develop and improve centre operations and outcomes for children</li>
<li>systems and processes for planning, assessment and evaluation of the centre programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Rotorua Sunset completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, implements the action plan developed by the PSM to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of ABC Rotorua Sunset will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
