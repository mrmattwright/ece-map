</table><p>Sunnynook Community Early Learning¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunnynook Community Early Learning is licensed to provide education and care for 25 children, including up to eight aged under two years. All children play together in a mixed-age setting. The centre hours of operation are similar to those of a school day, but some children attend either morning or afternoon sessions. Children and their families come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and many speak more than one language.</p><p>The service is situated in the Sunnynook Community Centre, and works closely with locally based agencies to promote positive outcomes for children. A management committee oversees governance of the centre. The Sunnynook Community Centre manager represents the service on the management committee.</p><p>A supervisor leads two other qualified teachers and an experienced reliever. Their teaching philosophy is strongly focused on providing equitable outcomes for children, working in partnership with their families/whƒÅnau. Teachers aim to build meaningful relationships with their community, and promote sustainability to develop children's care for and stewardship of the environment.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified many positive features, including teachers' skilful work to promote children's wellbeing and participation, effective leadership, and the sense of community in the centre. Areas for continued development were identified as the appraisal system, assessment and programme evaluation records, the philosophy, and strategic planning. The teaching team has responded very positively to these areas for development.</p><p>Since the previous review the service has undergone a name change. It was formerly known as Sunnynook Community Creche.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a positive sense of belonging in the centre environment. They confidently part from their whƒÅnau, are eager to explore, and settle easily into play. Children benefit from the mixed-age setting where they can play with their siblings, and there are opportunities for tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their families into the centre. Their gentle ways support children's wellbeing, investigations and risk taking. The teaching team are collaborative and supportive of each other. Their calmness underpins the pace of the programme.</p><p>Children are provided with many opportunities to develop their knowledge and awareness of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa. The environment contains many visual links to te ao MƒÅori, and te reo MƒÅori is woven through centre routines. The team has identified this as an area they will continue to strengthen.</p><p>Teachers' language and conversations with children reflect their knowledge of each child as a learner. They affirm and celebrate children's achievements, and allow time for children to work through and solve their own problems. Children's developing social competence is well supported by their teachers.</p><p>The indoor environment is thoughtfully set out, giving children easy access to a wide range of quality resources. The outdoor play space offers a good range of physical challenges. Children are confident to add their own complexity to these, while being well supported by teachers.</p><p>Programme planning is based on teachers' observations of children's interests. Teachers have numerous opportunities to discuss their observations and collaboratively plan their responses. Parents' aspirations are valued and included in the planning. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is highly visible in centre practices and documentation.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is evident in practice. Teachers and staff are very inclusive of children. They have well-established links to community groups that enhance learning opportunities for children and their families. Teachers could now consider how they might make more visible the cultural backgrounds of all children in the centre's environment and documentation.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. Relationships across the teaching team and the management committee are built on high levels of trust and respect. Well-developed strategic and annual plans guide the centre's future direction. Centre improvements are made through well-researched projects. Evaluation of centre practices would be strengthened if guided by evaluative questions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for continued improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation through the use of evaluative questions to guide the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen programme evaluation with a focus on learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunnynook Community Early Learning completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunnynook Community Early Learning will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
