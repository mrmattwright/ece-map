</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (206) is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre - Puriri (206) is one of 12 early childhood education and care centres in Christchurch owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The centre operates under the Kindercare philosophy and management and accountability systems. An area manager works in partnership with centre leaders to guide the effective operation of each centre.</p><p>Kindercare Learning Centre- Puriri (206) is located in a character villa in Fendalton and serves a culturally diverse community. The centre provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age in three separate rooms. These rooms are specifically designed to the meet the developing needs of different age groups of children.</p><p>Most staff have been at the centre for a long period of time and are qualified and registered teachers. An on-site cook provides nutritious vegetarian meals and snacks for children.</p><p>The leaders and teachers have continued to build on many of the strengths outlined in the 2014 ERO report. The leadership team has been extended to include a curriculum leader. The building has been renovated and outside garden areas have been upgraded.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have been responsive to the recommendations from the previous ERO review. This includes recent developments in assessment, planning and evaluation, placing an increasing focus on bicultural perspectives and aligning self review to centre and curriculum priorities. Leaders are developing links with local schools to help support transition-to-school processes for children.</p><p>The service has developed a focus and training to provide parent education and support to families.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 Kindercare Learning Centres reviewed in the Christchurch area in Term 1 2017.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy of children learning in a safe, loving and supportive environment is well understood by staff and is embedded in all aspects of centre operation. Children are at the heart of centre practices and the curriculum.</p><p>Leaders and teachers actively foster children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. They promote inclusive, positive and reciprocal relationships with children and families. Children are well supported to make successful transitions into the centre and between rooms.</p><p>Teachers respond sensitively and respectfully to children's individual interests, strengths and capabilities. Consistent caregiving supports the need for young children to have strong and secure attachments. Infants and toddlers enjoy unhurried, calm routines that purposefully align to parent preferences.</p><p>Children benefit from well-planned resourcing and presentation of the orderly, homely learning environments. They have easy access to a wide range of equipment, including natural materials that promote creative, imaginative and exploratory play experiences.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are placing an increasing focus on developing understandings and use of bicultural practices in ways that are respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>Children play well with and alongside others. Teachers work closely with children to help develop children&rsquo;s confidence, independence and decision making skills. They make good use of internal and external expertise to support children, including those with additional needs.</p><p>Parents and whan&#257;u are regularly informed of children&rsquo;s learning interests through the use of technologies, informative wall displays and conversations with teachers.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed by a supportive leadership team. Teachers' strengths are well used. They attend regular professional learning and development to improve their knowledge, teaching practices and evaluation processes. Teachers' leadership potential is recognised and fostered through regular coaching and mentoring.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers work collaboratively to successfully implement Kindercare management, curriculum and health and safety systems. They are building a reflective team culture where teachers regularly discuss ways to continually improve teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are for centre leaders and teachers to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural perspectives within centre practices and documentation</li>
<li>the depth and breadth of evaluation processes</li>
<li>new assessment, planning and evaluation processes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd could consider:</p><ul>
<li>giving greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in key documentation</li>
<li>further developing strategic coverage of priorities, annual action planning and evaluation processes in centres</li>
<li>considering ways to strengthen partnerships in learning with schools</li>
<li>formalising and documenting the procedure for appraisal and attestation in the Christchurch area</li>
<li>evaluating how well current learning record practices allow children to revisit their own learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Puriri (206) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres - Puriri (206) will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.&nbsp;</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service&nbsp;</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
