<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1.&nbsp;The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Tui Playcentre, in Papatoetoe, is a well established centre that operates as a parent cooperative, under the umbrella of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The centre is open for four sessions a week. The Association provides the centre with an adult education programme and a framework of policies and procedures that support parents in the administration of this centre. As many members are new to the centre, Association personnel may need to provide more comprehensive support to help develop and sustain good practices in all areas of centre operations.</p>
<p>In 2008 ERO noted that children and parents enjoyed their time in the centre. Centre members provided a range of learning experiences that supported children&rsquo;s participation in play. These good practices continue to be evident. With Association support, centre members should continue to develop assessment and planning that responds to and extends children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p>
<p>Centre members provide a well resourced environment that encourages childinitiated play for a mixed age group. Children are happy, settled and eager to learn. They choose from a wide range of activities for which adults provide additional resources and assistance if necessary. The large outside area is well equipped for children to participate in physically challenging and active play. Children play well alongside their peers and engage in sustained play. Association personnel and experienced members should continue to provide leadership and to model ways of supporting and extending children&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>Warm caring relationships between adults and children are evident in positive interactions. Centre members are supportive of each other in their roles as parents and educators. New members are encouraged to take an active role in the management of the centre. They appreciate the advice and regular visits of Association personnel.</p>
<p>ERO recommends that the Tamaki Playcentre Association support centre members to improve self review and strategic planning that focuses on continuous improvements in the programme and centre operations.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the centre members of Tui Playcentre were invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTui Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Tui Playcentre is operated cooperatively by parents/wh&#257;nau of children enrolled and is open for four sessions a week. In 2008, ERO reported that the centre was well resourced, play-based, and child-centred. ERO suggested that centre members seek Association support to improve self review and to strengthen the documentation of children&rsquo;s learning. Centre membership has recently changed and many members are new to the centre. While centre members continue to benefit from the guidance and support of experienced members and the Association, the new group requires added support to make and sustain improvements in the centre.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><em>Positive relationships.</em> Friendly and supportive relationships between adults and children underpin the welcoming tone of the centre. Children are affirmed by adults for their involvement and ideas. Children play positively alongside each other and cooperatively in small groups. Adults respond quickly to comfort and reassure children when needed. Adults encourage each other in their roles as parents and educators. Children are happy and settled in the centre. They show a strong sense of belonging as they develop friendships and group skills.</p>
<p><em>Participation in play.</em> Centre members value and encourage child-initiated play. They work enthusiastically alongside children supporting their play with additional resources and timely suggestions. More experienced members engage children in sustained conversations that foster children&rsquo;s learning. Children persist at chosen activities for sustained periods. Centre members&rsquo; strong commitment to Playcentre adult education supports their work in helping children to develop confidence and competence in their abilities and learning.</p>
<p><em>Programme implementation.</em> Centre members provide a play-based programme that strongly reflects the Playcentre philosophy of adults and children learning together. They work alongside children to provide:</p>
<ul><li>a good range of activities and resources that provide opportunities for children to make choices and enjoy long uninterrupted periods of play;</li>
<li>flexible routines that are often group occasions during which social skills and conversation are encouraged;</li>
<li>encouragement for children&rsquo;s enjoyment of reading, music and dance; and</li>
<li>opportunities to try out new experiences and return to familiar ones.</li>
</ul><p>The shared administration of the centre, combined with good Association support, is a means of enabling all members to be informed about and included in providing sessions that foster children&rsquo;s engagement in play.</p>
<p><em>Learning environment.</em> Centre members provide an inviting and interesting learning environment that reflects the multicultural backgrounds of families attending. The internal play areas are thoughtfully presented and resources are easily accessible to children. Enthusiasm for children&rsquo;s creativity is reflected in a good provision of art and messy play materials. The well equipped spacious outside area offers a variety of challenging activities to promote children&rsquo;s physical development. Children are curious and eager to learn. They enjoy participating in play, make choices and are well supported to explore and engage with resources and activities.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p><em>Improving assessment planning and evaluation.</em> With Association support, centre members should continue to develop assessment and planning that responds to and extends children&rsquo;s learning and development. They could strengthen sessional evaluation by identifying children&rsquo;s actual interests in the area of play. Making the initial and future response more clearly evident should support the continuity of the programme and make it easier for all members to contribute to children&rsquo;s ongoing learning.</p>
<p><em>Further steps for centre improvement.</em> The Association could also support centre members to:</p>
<ul><li>ensure that the programmes provide challenge and extension for older children;</li>
<li>foster more opportunities for sustained conversations in which adults use open-ended questions, provide time for children to respond, and prompt replies;</li>
<li>continue to support newer members to understand the Playcentre philosophy;</li>
<li>assist experienced members to provide leadership and to model ways of supporting and extending children&rsquo;s play in ways that promote problem solving and investigation; and</li>
<li>find ways to improve the provision of space and resources for infants.</li>
</ul><p><em>Documented self review.</em> Centre members are developing self-review practices that encourage members to reflect on the effectiveness and quality of the programme. Centre members should, with Association support:</p>
<ul><li>increase their ownership of, and build on, the existing strategic plan by developing priorities for the centre and long-term educational goals;</li>
<li>develop annual plans that include yearly objectives and priorities linked to the strategic plan; and</li>
<li>continue to review the placement of play areas and the provision of resources.</li>
</ul><p>These good practices should result in a framework against which centre members could review their progress. Clear identification of gains made will enable centre members to celebrate achievements and to plan strategically for the ongoing development of the centre.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since 2007, centre members have continued to include some te reo M&#257;ori in the programme and the families currently attending are gaining confidence in this area. Tui Playcentre is a family/wh&#257;nau cooperative and thus all families are fully consulted and involved in the operation of the centre. Centre members consult with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau about the management of the centre and ways of sharing knowledge about tikanga M&#257;ori.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><em>Philosophy and practice.</em> Playcentre philosophy and policies include a clear commitment to Tiriti o Waitangi and acknowledge the place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. The Association and centre have designated people and specific processes to support M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau in the centre. Wh&#257;nau aspirations are included in the planning and programme as part of the Playcentre philosophy.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p><em>Self review.</em> Reviewing centre practices and progress alongside the goals of Ka Hikitia: Managing for Success, the Ministry of Education M&#257;ori education strategy, would support centre members&rsquo; commitment to biculturalism. This self-review process would help centre members to meet the changing interests and aspirations of M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing good practice.</em> Although some adults use te reo M&#257;ori, and aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori are included in the programme, members could support each other in increasing their confidence in the use of te reo and understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the centre members of Tui Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p>
<ul><li>restrict children&rsquo;s access to areas behind the buildings where there may be potential hazards; and</li>
<li>ensure that planned developments to improve property issues and boundary fencing are implemented.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre members agree that the Tamaki Playcentre Association support centre members to:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>focus assessment and planning on responding to and extending children&rsquo;s interests;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase strategies that support and extend children&rsquo;s conversations and play; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focus self review and strategic planning on continuous improvements in the programme and centre operations.</p>
</li>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-tui-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Tui Playcentre</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Tui Playcentre.</p>
<p>Tui Playcentre, in Papatoetoe, is a well established centre that operates as a parent cooperative, under the umbrella of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The centre is open for four sessions a week. The Association provides the centre with an adult education programme and a framework of policies and procedures that support parents in the administration of this centre. As many members are new to the centre, Association personnel may need to provide more comprehensive support to help develop and sustain good practices in all areas of centre operations.</p>
<p>In 2008 ERO noted that children and parents enjoyed their time in the centre. Centre members provided a range of learning experiences that supported children&rsquo;s participation in play. These good practices continue to be evident. With Association support, centre members should continue to develop assessment and planning that responds to and extends children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p>
<p>Centre members provide a well resourced environment that encourages childinitiated play for a mixed age group. Children are happy, settled and eager to learn. They choose from a wide range of activities for which adults provide additional resources and assistance if necessary. The large outside area is well equipped for children to participate in physically challenging and active play. Children play well alongside their peers and engage in sustained play. Association personnel and experienced members should continue to provide leadership and to model ways of supporting and extending children&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>Warm caring relationships between adults and children are evident in positive interactions. Centre members are supportive of each other in their roles as parents and educators. New members are encouraged to take an active role in the management of the centre. They appreciate the advice and regular visits of Association personnel.</p>
<p>ERO recommends that the Tamaki Playcentre Association support centre members to improve self review and strategic planning that focuses on continuous improvements in the programme and centre operations.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
