</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ra-itu Koanga Reo is an early childhood centre connected to the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Tokoroa, South Waikato. Its curriculum is based on Cook Island MƒÅori culture and language and Christian values. Staff focus on supporting good quality educational outcomes for children. The akonga is governed by a management committee, which includes church and parent representatives as well as centre staff.</p><p>The akonga provides a total immersion kuki airani and Cook Island MƒÅori early childhood context for up to 27 children, including up to ten infants and toddlers under two years of age. The majority of children are of Cook island heritage while some are MƒÅori and other ethnic groups.</p><p>The akonga operates in spacious, purpose-built premises next to the church. The management committee employs a centre manager/administrator, who is also a teacher at the centre, to support akonga operations. The teaching team includes five qualified teachers and two relieving teachers.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 report identified that some good progress had been made in improving the quality of programmes for children and in developing management systems. It also identified the need for the management committee to develop and embed systems needed to operate the centre effectively and to further improve learning programmes for children. While some progress has been made, this report finds that centre management still needs to place priority on improving the day to day management of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the akonga are confident and enjoy a sense of belonging in their environment. They relate well with the adults and welcome visitors with ease. They know each other and each other‚Äôs families well through being part of a close church community.</p><p>Children benefit from playing in mixed-age groups and enjoy both cooperative and individual play activities. Indoor and outdoor resources are available for all children. The environment is vibrant, attractive and features culturally relevant displays that celebrate children and their work.</p><p>Many children understand kuki airani and can respond appropriately to adults in this language. Not all teachers are fluent speakers of kuki airani, but all have Cook Island heritage and promote play and learning through the use of language and culture. They support children to choose their activities and help them to negotiate and cooperate with each other and to share resources.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They plan for children‚Äôs interests and strengths, using these interests and strengths in preparations for group activities and whole centre outings. Christian values are promoted well within the daily programme.</p><p>Teachers include their assessments of children‚Äôs work in well presented children‚Äôs portfolios. All parents are invited to add their comments to their child‚Äôs portfolio and some parents use this opportunity to share children‚Äôs home interests. Recent professional development on self review is helping teachers to reflect more effectively on the quality of their own teaching practices.</p><p>The management board meets regularly, supporting the centre manager in her role and monitoring the akonga‚Äôs long term development. There is a strong sense of family and community in the akonga. The Cook Island cultural model of leadership provides children, teachers and parents with many opportunities for leadership in the centre and in community activities. Cultural and Christian values determine many of the relationships at the akonga. Leaders base their relationships with families and staff on the principles of respect, trust and reciprocity.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and committee representatives agree that their next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening management practices and systems to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the akonga</li>
<li>further improving communication between management, staff and parents</li>
<li>better aligning the akonga‚Äôs strategic goals with the centre‚Äôs vision and better monitoring progress made in achieving strategic goals</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen ways in which teachers inquire into their practice and promote strategies that extend children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ra-itu Koanga Reo completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>To meet agreed accountabilities the service provider must ensure that they obtain a Police vet of every person who is not a registered teacher working at the service during times the centre is in operation.</p><p><em>The Education Act 1989, 319D to 319FA</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ra-itu Koanga Reo will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
