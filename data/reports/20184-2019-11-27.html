</table><p>Learning Adventures Warkworth¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Adventures Warkworth was previously known as Kowhai Kids Educare. It is licensed to provide education and care for 50 children, including up to 15 aged under two years. Children are grouped according to age, and programmes are provided in two separate neighbouring houses. A gate allows easy access between the two sites. The roll includes small numbers of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>The centre has been owned by Evolve Education Group (EEG) since 2014 and its name was changed in 2016. Visiting personnel from EEG support the centre in its day-to-day operations and long-term planning and development projects.</p><p>The manager and two head teachers work alongside three other qualified teachers and three unqualified support staff. During a recent review of the centre philosophy, five main priorities for learning were identified. These include respect, empathy and compassion, sustainability, health and happiness, and confidence and curiosity.</p><p>The service has responded positively to the 2016 ERO report, which identified leadership, self review and increasing the challenge and complexity of children's play as areas for improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play well together and with their teachers in the centre environment. Infants and toddlers benefit from good teacher to child ratios. Teachers know the children well. They plan individual programmes for children, whose individual portfolios contain some well written learning stories.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have worked well with support staff to provide attractively presented indoor learning environments.</p><p>EEG has developed a robust appraisal process. Leaders need to ensure that this process is implemented consistently, and purposefully supports the development of effective teaching practice leading to endorsement of teacher registration.</p><p>There are significant concerns about health and safety provisions in the service. EEG support staff and centre leaders have not yet established systems to ensure all health and safety policies and procedures are implemented as required. Records and practices that require improvement include those relating to fire and other emergency evacuations, accident reporting and medication administration.</p><p>Managers need to take urgent action to respond to and implement a recently developed management plan relating to asbestos in the preschool premises. Management attention is also required to expedite repairs to the flooring in the preschool building and to eliminate vermin safely across both sites.</p><p>A drainage issue in the outdoor activity space should also be addressed urgently. Outdoor areas need to be clean and suitably surfaced for a variety of activities. Soft fall areas around outdoor equipment need to be replenished or replaced. Damaged equipment needs to be removed and all other identified hazards eliminated.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Adventures Warkworth completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to health and safety, premises and facilities, governance and management. Since the on-site phase of ERO's review, EEG and centre managers have begun to take steps to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all indoor and outdoor surfaces and furniture are safe and suitable for their intended use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities are kept in good repair, maintained regularly, used safely and kept free from hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>processes for teacher appraisal and the endorsement of practising certificates are robust.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 46; Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS1,8,27,28; PF2,5,13,16; GMA7.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Learning Adventures Warkworth. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>27 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
