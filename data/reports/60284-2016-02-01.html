</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greytown Early Years Incorporated is a mixed-age early childhood centre catering for children from birth to five years of age. It is licensed for 22 children including 5 under two years. Five children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre was previously known as the Greytown Community Creche. There have been ongoing property developments.</p><p>The March 2012 ERO report identified the need to improve governance, management and curriculum. Following a Ministry of Education visit, the centre was placed on a transitional licence and support was provided. A full licence was issued in 2013.</p><p>The April 2013 ERO supplementary review noted positive progress in addressing issues. These developments are embedded and further improvements have been made.</p><p>The board, compromising of parents, staff and community, oversee centre operations. Significant staffing changes include two new managers. They share the role and report to the board. Two recently appointed lead teachers provide curriculum leadership and oversee centre operations. The teaching team is relatively new.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is evident in practice. Respectful teaching and learning practices positively promote quality learning outcomes for children. The centre setting is interesting and homely. There is a calm, nurturing atmosphere where children, parents and families feel welcome and valued.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is effectively extended by teachers through discussions, activities and problem-solving tasks. Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. Staff encourage children's interest in reading, writing, construction, exploration and dramatic play.</p><p>Older children experience leadership opportunities in a mixed-age curriculum. Toddlers are suitably challenged and supported to extend their own capabilities. The environment encourages infants and toddlers to lead their learning at their pace.</p><p>An easy flow between indoor and outdoor spaces, and the considered arrangement of equipment, encourages children to self-manage and be physically active. This focus, along with healthy food choices, has been recognised with a gold award from the Heart Foundation.</p><p>Staff know children and their families well. This helps to build a shared sense of belonging and identity. Children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing is fostered.</p><p>Centre staff are continuing to develop an appropriate bicultural curriculum. Teachers participate in professional development and are establishing links with local iwi to further te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori, including plans to further reflect the uniqueness of the local setting. WhƒÅnau are involved in collaboratively developing learning plans for their child.</p><p>Parents receive good information about their children‚Äôs participation and engagement in learning profiles and centre newsletters. They are encouraged to share information about their children‚Äôs preferences at home and interests in family activities. This informs centre planning and building connections in learning.</p><p>Most children transition to the local school. This close relationship supports older children to become familiar with school life before enrolling.</p><p>The centre has well-developed self-review processes that are improvement focused. Through review, teachers better understand each child's learning, including how they demonstrate courage, perseverance and persistence.</p><p>The board provides strong governance and support for the managers and staff. The collaborative development of the strategic plan sets a clear direction and promotes ownership by all members of the centre community. Clear management systems and practices enable centre operations. Some positive centre practices, such as assessment, appraisal and self review, require further documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers have identified the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and implement the bicultural curriculum and specific strategies for MƒÅori children's success</li>
<li>document current good practice in assessment, appraisal and self-review</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greytown Early Years Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Greytown Early Years Incorporated will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
