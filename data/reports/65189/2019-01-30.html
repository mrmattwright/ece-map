</table><p>Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 (Busy Bodies) provides home-based care and education in nine educators' homes in Invercargill. It provides education for children from birth to six years. Educators care for up to four children at a time. The educators are supported by qualified teachers who regularly visit and provide ongoing advice and ideas.</p><p>Busy Bodies believes that strong relationships between team members, parents, educators, children and the community are paramount. Visiting teachers and educators work in partnership with parents where respect for each other's values, beliefs, aspirations and cultural identities is fostered. Busy Bodies prides itself on being able to offer whƒÅnau a home away from home, where children can feel a sense of security and feel they belong to, and are part of, their educator's extended family. This enables children to 'contribute to their learning programme and become active explorers, thinkers and risk takers'.</p><p>Busy Bodies' values include nurturing learning environments, having cultural awareness and sensitivity, close communication and fostering strong relationships.</p><p>Busy Bodies has two networks and two new visiting teachers. The visiting teachers have developed systems to strengthen and build capability of leadership in the organisation. Busy Bodies' strategic plan is guiding decision making and direction, and through its goals the service is addressing the recommendations of the 2016 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews of Busy Bodies Childcare 2008.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in inclusive, caring and family-like settings. They are carefully matched with their educators and form positive, trusting relationships. This includes the sensitive placement of children under two and children who may need additional support. Children and their families have a strong sense of belonging to Busy Bodies Childcare where respectful and genuine partnerships are fostered. This enables educators to support children to 'lead' their own learning, while responding to children's parents' wishes, when planning.</p><p>Busy Bodies values the holistic learning of the children. It achieves valued outcomes through a broad and responsive curriculum. Children are provided with opportunities for play-based and child-led learning in home settings and within the community. Educators are supported to provide programmes that respond to children's interests, needs and strengths which are informed by the wishes of parents and whƒÅnau. Currently this includes a service-wide focus on the 'sharing and caring' dispositions of two and three-year-old children.</p><p>Busy Bodies has clear expectations for educators. They are supported by visiting teachers who provide ongoing and specific mentoring and resourcing which strengthens their practice. Educators are coached to build on their skills in working with children and to deliver programmes that respond to the uniqueness of each individual. Children benefit from the professional conversations between visiting teachers and educators. There continues to be a focus on building leadership capability across the organisation.</p><p>Educators and visiting teachers are building their teaching capability through meaningful, targeted professional development. Educators report experiencing a shift in their practice as a result of deliberate and focused tools, systems and processes that are ensuring a better quality of service for children and their families. This has included improved communication within the service, and strengthened relationships and collaborations across the organisation. The owner and visiting teachers are committed to further developing these practices.</p><p>The owner and visiting teachers reflect on their practice and are focused on improving what they do for children. They have strengthened their strategic plan and direction in response to external support. As a result, they have set clear priorities for continued improvement and aligned these to internal evaluation to improve outcomes for children. They have linked their philosophy and their parent relationships and aspirations for children to drive changes throughout the service, now and into the future.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue strengthening the alignment of strategic planning and priorities with curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation, and outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen the appraisal system to explicitly align with the teaching standards</li>
<li>increase bicultural knowledge and practices in daily interactions with children and families/whƒÅnau</li>
<li>continue strengthening internal evaluation systems and practices to effectively evaluate the impact of initiatives on children's learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Busy Bodies Childcare 2008 will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
