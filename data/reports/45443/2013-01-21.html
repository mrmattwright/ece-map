<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Early Learning Counties Manukau &ndash; Wattle Cove is a new centre that is continuing to increase its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children, with support from Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO review. The centre, adjacent to Reremoana School, is located in a newly subdivided area between Takanini and Manurewa.</p><p>The centre is part of Early Learning Counties Manukau (ELCM), a subsidiary of Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). ELCM is governed by a board of directors. The centre is licensed for children up to school age.</p><p>The centre was established as a result of the local community desire to increase the provision for early childhood education and care. This report focuses on the area for children over the age of two, which opened in 2010. The adjacent area, for children up to the age of two, opened in 2011. Together, the two licences on this site cater for up to 80 children.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers are registered teachers. An external early childhood provider is contracted to mentor teachers who are provisionally registered. Teachers have many opportunities to benefit from professional development.</p><p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi is respected as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and teachers&rsquo; bicultural practice honours that commitment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide learning opportunities that foster a holistic approach for children. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy clearly outlines the service&rsquo;s commitment to promoting children&rsquo;s positive self image with an emphasis on respectful relationships.</p><p>Children are supported to be confident and competent learners. Their wellbeing and sense of belonging are nurtured by caring and compassionate teachers. Children are respected and trust that teachers will tend to their needs. Teachers provide a variety of learning experiences that promote positive outcomes for children. The centre has a warm atmosphere.</p><p>Children settle quickly into the centre&rsquo;s routines when they arrive. They are comfortable in the centre environment and approach adults with confidence. Children are encouraged to be independent, particularly at meal times. Positive interactions among children and teachers are evident. Children with special learning needs are well supported.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; relationships with children and their parents are well established and this has strengthened through self review and good teamwork. Teachers could further strengthen their partnership with families by providing opportunities for parents to document their aspirations for their child and using these more often in programme planning and individual children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p>The service promotes partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. To provide for the ongoing success of M&#257;ori children, centre leaders and teachers have appropriately identified the need to continue to increase the bicultural aspects in the programme and engage in professional development to build the teachers&rsquo; confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori. Key cultural events are celebrated and children benefit from learning about diversity.</p><p>The centre environment is spacious and invites children&rsquo;s exploration. Well designed outdoor areas offer opportunities for children to use spaces and materials in creative ways. Reviewing the use of, and links between, areas of play could provide further opportunities for children to sustain their play. Teachers could minimise tidy-up routines to offer children opportunities to revisit their learning and develop children&rsquo;s thinking by engaging them in more complex conversations.</p><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that teachers could further strengthen the curriculum and promote positive outcomes for children by:</p><ul>
<li>developing programme planning approaches that support more individual children's interests</li>
<li>improving the quality and consistency of children&rsquo;s assessment documentation</li>
<li>including opportunities for children to explore Pacific values and contexts and New Zealand&rsquo;s place in the Pacific.</li>
</ul><p>The centre is well managed. Effective financial management and resourcing for ongoing improvement is evident. Clear systems and processes support centre operations. Self review is an established part of management practice. The centre manager models an inclusive approach, which is appreciated by teachers and families. Useful external support, administration services and advice are provided by the leadership team of Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that relevant next steps to strengthen governance and management include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a centre-specific annual plan and process that is reflective of the goals, vision and aspirations of the CMKA strategic plan</li>
<li>making policies and procedures specific to ELCM Wattle Cove</li>
<li>documenting expectations for effective teaching and learning, so that teachers can continue to align their practice with centre philosophy and evaluate their success.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that teachers should continue to develop their use of self review to further improve the quality of programmes and to promote opportunities for children to extend their learning.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Learning Counties Manukau - Wattle Cove completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>21 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
