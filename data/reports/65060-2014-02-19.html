</table><p>Annabel’s Educare is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews of the Annabel's Educare Ltd organisation.</p><p>Annabel’s Educare is one of seven centres owned and operated by Annabel’s Educare Ltd. This centre caters for children from birth to three years. The other two centres located on the Darfield site cater for children aged three and four years.</p><p>The centre has a separate nursery and two-year-old indoor and outdoor areas. These areas are spacious, well presented and resourced. The staff are registered early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers. Many of the teachers have worked at Annabel’s for a number of years.</p><p>Annabel’s management framework for the centres and the high level of support that managers provide is helping to ensure a high quality service is provided for all children at the centre. The managers have made good use of the June 2008 ERO report to further enhance self review and child assessment practices to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six centres that are owned and administered by Annabel’s Education Ltd</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a bicultural curriculum that strongly reflects Māori values and the centre’s philosophy. It places significant emphasis on maintaining positive relationships, a sense of belonging and learning together. The centre’s pepeha clearly shows the children’s and their families’ close links to local history and how the land sustains them.</p><p>Infants and toddlers respond well to and have positive relationships with their teachers. Home routines are closely followed and parents are kept well informed about their child’s learning and progress. Teachers successfully involve these very young children in decision making and problem solving in their play and care routines. They skilfully interpret infants and toddlers attempts to communicate. They use simple, clear language and give children time to respond. Infants and toddlers are happy and settled in the nursery environment.</p><p>Two-to-three year old children confidently select from the wide range of resources available in the indoor and outdoor areas. They work independently and are well supported by their teachers to involve other children in their play. ERO observed that most teachers actively join in children’s play and use innovative ways to extend their learning and enjoyment.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported to participate in all aspects of the programme. Their goals are carefully monitored in consultation with their parents.</p><p>Assessment makes good use of children’s interests to clearly identify children’s learning, their progress and next steps. Parents and children regularly comment on the learning and make close links between home and centre experiences.</p><p>Teachers have a good understanding of self review and make effective use of it to continue to improve the programme and the quality of learning and teaching.</p><p>Teachers work well together in the nursery, the two year old area and across the centre to support each other to meet the interests, abilities and needs of the children in the programme.</p><p>The managers provide effective leadership for the organisation and support for the centre’s curriculum leader. Teachers are actively encouraged to continue to develop their skills and knowledge. They take an active role in achieving the organisation’s vision for high quality education and care.</p><p>The organisation has a well developed management framework that effectively guides the operation of the centres. The managers and teachers have recently developed key values and principles for the organisation. These values and beliefs are being linked to all aspects of centre operations to help to ensure Annabel’s high expectations for the centres are sustained and promoted by all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next key steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen strategic planning so that it more clearly shows links to annual plans, self review and staff appraisal goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to extend the ways teachers use their skills and knowledge to promote children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Annabel's Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Annabel's Educare will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
