</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO report for Discoveries Educare at Gillies. The centre, located in Epsom, was established in 2013 in a refurbished bungalow. It provides full and part time early childhood education and care for children for up to 25 children, including seven children under two years of age. The multicultural staff reflects the diverse community served by the centre.</p><p>The centre is part of the Discoveries Educare group of centres that are located across Auckland. The group provides a framework of governance and management, with the option for centres to make some adjustments to suit their specific contexts. A business manager supports centres with operational matters, and a recently appointed director of operations will provide expertise to review and strengthen governance systems and practices. There are plans to extend this tier of management to increase support across all Discoveries Educare centres.</p><p>The centre philosophy and vision are strongly focused on providing a high quality service to children and their families. In addition, managers and teachers are committed to building respectful and caring relationships with children and families. Most of the teachers are fully qualified, and two teachers have provisional registration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre. They benefit from patient, gentle and positive interactions with teachers. Children know about making choices and independently selecting resources. They enjoy programmes that provide good opportunities for them to access a wide range of play areas.</p><p>Teachers have respectful and trusting relationships with children. Teachers support children’s early literacy and numeracy within the programme through activities such as reading stories and counting in English and Māori. The challenge now is for teachers to extend these learning opportunities in the context of children’s play and avoid teaching letters and numbers in isolation or by using worksheets.</p><p>Good efforts are made to integrate te reo Māori and waiata into the programme. Teachers support children’s home language and cultures well by using greetings and reading children stories in their first language. They also talk with parents about their home languages and culture. Teachers should now focus on interacting and engaging with children more about their learning.</p><p>Teachers working with infants and toddlers are committed to fostering children’s competence and sense of belonging. Strategies such as enabling babies to sit together on chairs at a table for meals supports their wellbeing and encourages respectful relationships. Children under two years old explore resources with confidence. They could now benefit from teachers focusing more on their developmental milestones and using a wider range of strategies to extend toddlers’ language. Children’s transition through the centre is carefully managed by teachers in consultation with parents. </p><p>Programmes are based on group interests and teachers evaluate the programme at the end of each topic. Teachers have made good progress in responding to and recording children’s individual interests. An online tool strengthens teachers’ focus on individual children. Portfolios are an attractive record of children’s participation in the programme. They provide evidence of children engaging in a variety of activities, outings and events.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be partners in their child’s learning. Teachers provide opportunities for parents to participate in the programme, contribute to reviews and be aware of their children’s progress. Staff are very welcoming and inclusive. Parents are able to have input into children’s portfolios and learning stories. The establishment of the online parent portal provides easy, online access for parents to be involved.</p><p>The learning environments are attractive and well resourced. Materials and equipment are readily accessible to children. Maintaining consistent access to the outdoor play area is a challenge for teachers and children. A significant flight of stairs means the access for the youngest children must be closely monitored. However, teachers in the infant area make a considerable effort to enable toddlers to enjoy outdoor play.</p><p>Centre leaders have a strong commitment to building staff capability and providing ongoing professional learning and development for teachers. Good systems and processes for planned and spontaneous self review are focused on improving practices and outcomes for children. Self review also underpins professional discussions at staff meetings and supports teachers to build their knowledge about effective practice.</p><p>Appraisal processes foster teachers’ own reflections and they are encouraged to participate in external professional development individually, and as a group. The appraisal process has been effectively reviewed and provides a comprehensive format for teachers to meet legislative requirements for critical reflection, gathering evidence and goal setting.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing and improving the quality of teacher interactions with children in order to further challenge children’s thinking and extend their oral language</li>
<li>reviewing programme planning and assessment processes to increase the focus on children’s individual interests and the role that teachers will have in the programme</li>
<li>reviewing the strategic, annual and operational plans to clearly identify specific goals and the corresponding actions and strategies that will be implemented in the annual plan. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Discoveries Educare at Gillies completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Discoveries Educare at Gillies will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
