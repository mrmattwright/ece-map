</table><p>The Activity Room&nbsp;is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Activity Room is a licensed early childhood service for children in Christchurch Hospital. It is based within the Hospital Play Specialist service. The service is governed by the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) and is part of the Children's Ward. A new hospital block is under construction and will include new premises for The Activity Room and children's wards.</p><p>The service is sessional and is open Monday to Friday. It is licensed for 21 children, with a maximum of five aged under two years. Its role is to support children and their families to make sense of their hospital experience and maintain their wellbeing. The service&rsquo;s mission states: 'Our purpose is to create a place of belonging and to be a strong advocate for children and their wh&#257;nau. We build children's self-efficacy and empower them and their wh&#257;nau during their hospital stay'.</p><p>There have been significant staffing changes since the 2016 ERO report, including the appointment of a new team leader and several new Hospital Play Specialists (HPS). The team leader is responsible for the daily running of the service. Most of the six HPS are qualified early childhood teachers. Two are New Zealand registered HPS, one of whom is the practice supervisor who mentors and oversees the clinical practice of other teachers as they work towards gaining HPS registration. HPS work with children up to the age of 16, and their families, on the wards and in the dedicated activity room. The HPS also work closely with the health professionals within the child health team.</p><p>Leaders have made good progress addressing the recommendations for improvement in the 2016 ERO report. These include developing leaders&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; understanding and use of effective internal evaluation, aligning systems (including appraisal, professional development, internal evaluation and reporting) to the goals of the strategic plan, and continuing to strengthen bicultural and Treaty of Waitangi based practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are very well supported by the HPS who are highly effective in helping them maintain their wellbeing while in hospital. The service's mission and core values are enacted and evident in daily practices. The HPS are highly skilled at developing trusting relationships with children and their families, and take a holistic approach to supporting them. This helps to reduce the impact of anxiety related to being in hospital.</p><p>HPS engage in highly responsive interactions with children. Their role is complex and requires them to respond quickly to children's changing medical circumstances. They work closely with individual children and their family to prepare them for clinical procedures. This supports the child's sense of wellbeing.</p><p>Children benefit from the way HPS consistently and effectively meet their individual needs and interests. Collaborative and authentic individualised planning for children builds on their prior knowledge and learning dispositions. This supports them in developing their working theories and contributes to positive health and learning outcomes.</p><p>HPS are strong advocates for children and their families. They effectively explain clinical procedures to the child and their family to help them understand and be involved in decisions that affect them. Children are encouraged to build self-efficacy and, over time, take an active role in their health care.</p><p>The Activity Room is purposefully set out for children of all ages to play and learn free of medical procedures. It is well resourced, offers a broad variety of experiences and celebrates the languages and symbols of children's cultural background. The environment is inclusive. There is a separate space and resourcing for infants, and a range of ways older children and teenagers can access activities suitable for their age groups.</p><p>HPS work in close collaboration with health professionals and family members. They share information about children to identify who are most in need of their services for the day. A newly-developed assessment system has allowed for clearer communication between HPS and the wider medical team.</p><p>HPS work collaboratively with the Kaiwhakaako Hauora (Educator) and the Kaiwhakamahere Hauora Tamariki (Child Health Supervisor) to support M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau during their child&rsquo;s time in hospital. The importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is strengthened through these partnerships. Since the last ERO report, leaders and teachers have worked to build their understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori. They have identified this as an area that they will continue to strengthen.</p><p>Leadership is highly effective. Leaders base relationships on respect, trust and reciprocity. They work collaboratively with the CDHB, HPS, wider medical teams, parents and wh&#257;nau to promote positive outcomes for children. There is a collaborative approach to strategic planning. The service has a robust appraisal system with significant professional learning and development opportunities to build staff capability. The CDHB supports the service with a strong policy framework. There are good systems and practices in place to promote and support staff wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>build on and embed teachers' understanding of bicultural practices to further support children&rsquo;s learning and continue to strengthen partnerships with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori</li>
<li>further strengthen the current internal evaluation framework by developing a focused evaluative question for each internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Activity Room completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>15 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to two years of age.</p><p><i>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</i></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
