</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Marua/Mangaroa Playcentre (Te Marua) is one of 17 centres administered by the Lower Hutt Playcentre Association (the association). The association is made up of elected volunteer representatives from its member centres. It provides the parent committee at Te Marua with governance and management support. A kaitautoko, a centre support person is employed by the association to provide guidance.</p><p>The playcentre is located in a semi-rural setting in Upper Hutt.  It is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 25 children five days a week, including 20 children up to the age of two. An extended session, Tamarikinui, is held on a Friday. This primarily focuses on achieving the aspirations families and whānau hold for their older children.</p><p>Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Each session is supported by a team of parent educators who hold playcentre training certificates. Almost all centre members are involved in the adult education training programme provided by the association. The centre has sustained the good numbers taking advantage of this opportunity for active involvement in their child's education.  </p><p>The service and the association have a positive reporting history with the ERO. Effective centre practice identified in the September 2013 ERO report has been sustained.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight in the Hutt Playcentre Association.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s active exploration through play and engagement in learning is well supported by attentive parent educators. A positive tone and inclusive practice permeate the centre. Adults know the children well. A culture of care, respect and shared responsibility for leading children's play and learning is evident. </p><p>The service’s philosophy reviewed at the end of 2015, is an expression of what children do and what families want for their children. It appropriately reflects the playcentre philosophy of parent led education, learning through play and the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Assessment, curriculum planning and evaluation practices provide adults with useful information to help them plan programmes responsive to children’s interests, strengths and, if required, identified needs. Individual learning profile books celebrate children's progress, showing their developing skills, knowledge and attributes.</p><p>Children are physically active and enthusiastically explore the varied range of well-planned and spontaneous activities. The service's youngest children are nurtured and well supported to discover the many experiences available.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics, science activities and concept learning are integral parts of children’s early childhood experience. The inclusion of te ao Māori and all children's cultures languages and identities in the curriculum continues to evolve.</p><p>The association is an improvement focused organisation committed to providing timely and relevant support for its member centres. The 2013 ERO reviews found the support provided at the centre level by kaitautoko was appreciated and supportive. ERO also recognised that formalising this arrangement to promote a more effective approach for responding to the needs of individual centres was a next step for development. An evaluation of the effectiveness of changes to kaitautoko practice in improving outcomes for centre members and children is planned for.</p><p>At Te Marua playcentre, the parent-led committee and supervision groups include a diverse group of enthusiastic parents and whānau who bring valuable skills and knowledge to their roles. High levels of involvement of the centres community and a collective sense of responsibility to children, provides a positive platform for learning.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified centre leaders should further improve their assessment practice, using self review and association-provided frameworks more effectively. The dual purpose of self review for accountability and improvement is well understood. It informs decision-making and increasingly contributes to improvement. </p><p>The association should focus their efforts on supporting centre leaders to evaluate how effectively assessment, session planning and evaluation processes which guide practice, further enhance outcomes for children.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association:</p><ul>
<li>must implement rigorous annual appraisal for the kaitautoko and identify professional development to support them in their leadership roles</li>
<li>should build kaitautoko knowledge and capability to undertake effective internal evaluation. This should include a focus on providing centre members with evaluative feedback that assists them to further develop aspects of the curriculum and centre practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Marua/Mangaroa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management practices. To meet requirements the association needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>fully implement a system of regular appraisal  <br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em><b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Marua/Mangaroa Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 May 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
