</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mokopuna Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre (Tarewa) is located in central Whangarei and caters for infants and toddlers up to two years, and children up to five years of age. The centre welcomes children from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Most children currently attending the centre are MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is one of five early childhood services, including two in Auckland, managed by He Puna Marama Trust. It provides a kaupapa MƒÅori framework with a strong focus on te reo MƒÅori me ngƒÅ tikanga. This framework includes the values of tuakana/teina, whanaungatanga and kotahitanga. The centre‚Äôs Kai Arahi reo (MƒÅori language advisor) supports the teaching of te reo MƒÅori so that tamariki enjoy learning in a rich bilingual environment.</p><p>Nga pouako (teachers) provide tamariki with a spacious learning environment and a strong focus on natural resources. The centre has a separate room for tamariki under two but also encourages younger and older children to play and learn together. Most teachers are experienced and qualified and have worked together in the centre for many years. Children benefit from a committed and collaborative staff with good skills and strengths.</p><p>The trust actively promotes access to early childhood learning within Whangarei. It provides an extra 10 free hours of education and care in addition to the Ministry of Education‚Äôs 20 hour funding provision. The trust continues to provide good governance and management support for the centre, with the aid of a capable Education Services Manager.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report recognised the positive guidance and respectful care within the centre. The report recommended that the centre continue to promote te reo MƒÅori and opportunities for more challenging and creative play for children. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is promoted well with teachers providing a programme based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children have good opportunities to participate in whakatau, kapahaka and ngƒÅ pakiwaitara and to share these with whƒÅnau. Children experience good transition practices into local primary schools, particularly the adjacent kura kaupapa which is also governed by He Puna Marama Trust.</p><p>Children play cooperatively and are confident and content in the centre environment. They settle quickly into the different areas and play at their own pace. The calm, child-focused environment supports children to create meaningful and trusting relationships.</p><p>Teachers respond effectively with aroha to children. They are positive, supportive and respectful with children. Teachers value the importance of whanaungatanga and promote children‚Äôs social and emotional competence well, including their independence and self-management skills. Tamariki under two are well cared for and often included in mixed age play.</p><p>Children appreciate the opportunity to explore and to develop curiosity and enjoy their learning. They have access to all areas of play and learning resources. Teachers follow children‚Äôs lead in their learning by supporting and extending their individual and emerging interests. They promote children‚Äôs oral language, encouraging children to express themselves and to lead and use te reo MƒÅori. Children with special educational needs are well supported in their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers communicate effectively and regularly with whƒÅnau, and engage them as partners in their children‚Äôs learning. Children‚Äôs portfolios are visually appealing with a strong learning focus. WhƒÅnau are supportive of the centre's philosophy and appreciate the range of ways that the centre welcomes and includes them.</p><p>The pouwhakƒÅko (head teacher) provides opportunities for teachers to develop professional learning. Teachers improve their teaching practices and the learning environment and ensure that the centre‚Äôs philosophy is enacted.</p><p>Managers are well informed and receive regular reports about the centre's programme and operations. The management team and teachers work collaboratively to promote expectations and improvements to teachers‚Äô practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, teachers and ERO agree that the centre‚Äôs next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>developing meaningful planning processes and providing learning resources that offer challenging and creative play for children</li>
<li>promoting opportunities for children to develop conversational te reo MƒÅori</li>
<li>aligning teachers‚Äô appraisal process with <em>Practising Teachers‚Äô Criteria</em> and ensuring there is a focus on teaching strategies to challenge children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>strengthening strategic planning and self-review processes by including indicators of effective practice and evaluating of how well outcomes are met</li>
<li>ensuring regular policy review in relation to current legislative requirements, such as the <em>Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act 2014</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mokopuna Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre (Tarewa) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mokopuna Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Centre (Tarewa) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><ul>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
