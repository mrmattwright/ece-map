</table><p>Little Monkeys At Home¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Monkeys At Home has been operating since December 2017. It is a home-based care and education service where approved home educators provide education and care for children in the educator's homes. The service provider operates two education and care centres in Palmerston North. Little Monkeys At Home is licensed for a maximum of 50 children with up to 50 aged under two. The roll at the time of this ERO evaluation was 23, including four identifying as MƒÅori.</p><p>Two qualified kaiako (visiting teacher) are employed. Both support educators to provide appropriate care and education by visiting them and children in the homes. One of the kaiako facilitates regular playgroups. The service is in the process of becoming accredited to deliver the Level Four Certificate in Early Childhood Education.</p><p>The service's philosophy and approach to early childhood care and education is based on: being child centred; fostering innovative and professional educators; building collaborative relationships; being community focused; and providing a stimulating environment that focuses on natural resources and sustainable practices.</p><p>This is Little Monkeys At Home's first ERO evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service leaders provide a high level of support for educators to promote equitable learning opportunities for children. There are deliberate strategies to build educators' capabilities to achieve this. Systems and processes support curriculum and quality assurance. As the service has implemented these, regular feedback has been sought from educators and families. This has enabled the service to know what is working well for children and what needs more development.</p><p>Children engage in a good range of learning experiences in educators' homes and out in the community. Planned and spontaneous excursions and weekly playgroups outside the home are responsive to children's developing interests and strengths. These provide opportunities for children to socialise and develop social competencies with a larger group of children and adults.</p><p>The kaiako actively support, through modelling, educators' knowledge and understanding of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and the implications it has for assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. Learning stories show that educators create positive and fun environments for children. This enables children to develop curiosity, confidence and to be creative.</p><p>Children's portfolios are a valuable record of their participation in a wide range of learning experiences. These are shared with parents. Links are made between children's learning and development at their home and at the educator's home. Parents contribute and work alongside educators to make children's experiences positive. The service should consider how parents' aspirations for their children's learning can be better captured and acknowledged.</p><p>Strategic planning identifies key priorities for ongoing development. These priorities are well informed by feedback from educators and families. It guides direction for change. Leaders are very reflective and have established a framework and understanding of internal evaluation. This contributes to ongoing change and improvement. To further strengthen strategic planning, leaders should consider developing success indicators, regularly monitor progress against these and measure the impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Most children enrolled with Little Monkeys at Home are aged under three. The philosophy is to be reviewed this year. Leaders should consider how the philosophy reflects teaching and learning expectations for these young children, particularly those aged up to two years.</p><p>Individual children's language, culture and identity are acknowledged. Parents share a wide range of information about their families with the service, particularly the educators. Kaiako support children and educators by providing resources that focus on learning and understanding of the importance of weaving te ao MƒÅori through practices. The service's current internal evaluation is focused on strengthening knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>work closely in partnership with parents to gather their aspirations to inform children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic planning by developing success indicators and measuring the impact on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the philosophy to reflect teaching and learning expectations for infants and toddlers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Monkeys At Home completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>3 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
