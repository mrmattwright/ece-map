</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Karamuramu Kindergarten is located in Murupara township, south of Rotorua. Most of the children and families have links to NgƒÅti Manawa. Karamuramu kindergarten provides education and care for children from two years to school age. Children come from Murupara and surrounding districts that include Rerewhakaaitu, Kaingaroa, Galatea and Minginui. At the time of this ERO review, 42 children were enrolled including 26 tamariki of MƒÅori descent. The kindergarten operates a school day model from 8.30am to 2.30pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The kindergarten's mission and vision is 'To create an environment that empowers this community of learners to realise their potential as imaginative, creative, connected lifelong learners'.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association (TRK), which is a non-profit early childhood service, governed by a board of parent elected community representatives. The senior teacher role provides support and guidance for the team and mentoring for the head teacher.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities, organisational sustainability, meeting community needs, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching, education and care.</p><p>The kindergarten has responded positively and made good progress in relation to the areas of development identified in ERO's 2013 report. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher capacity, knowledge and understanding of local iwi history, legends, stories and tikanga MƒÅori practices in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic and annual plan in consultation with whƒÅnau and community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening processes for engaging with the whƒÅnau and community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing processes and strategies for researching and implementing a nature-based approach to education, where children learn in the local forest and bush.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This review was part of a cluster of two kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and engaged in their learning. There are high levels of cooperative and harmonious play among children. They are highly focused and confidently choose areas of play and set their own challenges and plans. They are self-assured, explore, learn alongside one another and engage in tuakana/teina relationships. Children are capable and competent learners, and teachers support them to reach their potential.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum where the MƒÅori language and culture are promoted, valued and celebrated and are strongly affirmed in their language, culture and identity. They benefit from the common place use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori as everyday language and practice. A strong MƒÅori presence is evident in the programme, the environment, the teaching team and community. WhƒÅnau relationships and engagement are a strength of the kindergarten where parents are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend time with their children and with each other.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with an appropriate range of support services to enhance accessibility to and participation in early childhood education for children and their families. Relationships with local schools include reciprocal visits and information sharing. These relationships contribute to positive transition to school for children and their families.</p><p>In keeping with the kindergarten's mission and vision teachers parents and community have created an extensive environment that supports children's risk taking, imagination, problem solving and respect for the world around them. The environment provides extensive opportunities for children to be physically active, set their own challenges and persevere over time to achieve success. They are engaged in sustainable practices such as, waste management, planting, growing, harvesting and using their produce. They demonstrate a high level of physical competence, care and ownership of their environment, along with the understanding that everything has a place and purpose.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and understand the importance of children's play as valued learning. Within this teaching philosophy children are trusted as capable and competent learners who have freedom to be self-managing and in charge of their learning. Teachers are attuned to the different ways that children express and explore their ideas. Their responses are intentional and include co-construction with children in self-initiated play. These quality interactions contribute to high levels of engagement, complex play and sustained learning. Literacy, mathematics and sciences are meaningfully integrated through the children's play and exploration.</p><p>Teachers have developed robust processes for documenting children's assessment. The framework of 'do you see me, do you hear me, do you know me' identifies each child's learning, strengths and dispositions and informs next steps for groups and individual children.</p><p>The head teacher provides effective and well informed professional leadership. She has established collaborative relationships based on trust and mutual respect with staff, whƒÅnau and community. Useful systems and frameworks are established to guide kindergarten operations, and teacher practice. These developments are contributing to an organisational culture of high expectations for learning where children are first and foremost, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Well-developed self review is consistently focused on improving outcomes for children. Teachers lead and implement long term, systematic and deliberate inquiries about their practice, systems and processes. These in-depth reviews promote quality reflections and involve children and whƒÅnau in gathering information and ideas. These reviews empower this community of learners to contribute to decisions about learning and teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further develop and embed the kindergarten's philosophy, mission and aims, the teaching team should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the relationship with the local iwi to understand NgƒÅti Manawatanga and its place in the Karamuramu Kindergarten curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop teacher reflections, learning conversations and professional critique to grow teacher practice and build their collective capacity to enhance learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the strategic plan through including clear goals that align to the kindergarten's vision and philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karamuramu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Karamuramu Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
