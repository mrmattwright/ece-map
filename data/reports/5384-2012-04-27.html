<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Tawa Central Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community. The senior teacher has worked with this kindergarten and community for the past eighteen months.</p><p>There have been many changes since the 2008 ERO review. Staffing has increased now that the kindergarten has three all-day sessions for older children and two half-day sessions for younger ones. The head teacher has been in her position for the past two years and the teaching team for the last 18 months. As a result of these changes, most systems are an early stage of development and implementation.</p><p>Teachers have given considerable thought to developing their philosophy to have a collective understanding of the principles and beliefs that underpin their behaviour and teaching practices. They have also developed written procedures to guide their use of Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation. Undertaking these processes has assisted teachers to come together as a team.</p><p>Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s independence. A free-choice programme operates, with children taking responsibility for much of their own learning. Active small groups are a feature with children gathering their own resources and sustaining their play within the group for considerable periods of time. Interactions between teachers and children and among children are positive and affirming.</p><p>Staff build on and extend children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Documentation on the planning wall and in children&rsquo;s portfolios indicates that authentic and exciting projects have involved children and parents in the past year. Portfolios are accessible for parents who are encouraged to add their own comments.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by the senior teacher as they work to embed their systems, develop a greater understanding of self review and make more use of their evaluation information to respond to children&rsquo;s learning. Good provision is made for children with special needs, with teachers working in partnership with families and other agencies.</p><p>The active parents&rsquo; committee is fundraising to upgrade and refurbish the kindergarten and resources.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Tawa Central Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTawa Central Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>There have been many changes for the kindergarten since the previous ERO review. A larger staff team caters for the increased times children are able to attend. There are now three all-day sessions for the older children and two half-day sessions for the younger ones.</p><p>Frequent staffing changes over the past few years have affected the kindergarten roll and programme development. The head teacher has been in her position for the past two years and the teaching team for the last 18 months. During 2011, as well as leading a new teaching team, the head teacher supported four teachers through their registration process.</p><p>In the previous ERO report it was noted that some aspects of the environment were in need of refurbishment and repair. Concerns relating to tripping hazards have been addressed as far as practicable.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The head teacher provides positive leadership. She models effective practices and interactions. She has established a constructive working relationship with the senior teacher who gives professional support and guidance to all staff.</p><p>Teachers are at an early stage of developing shared understandings. The time spent on unpacking their team philosophy to agree expectations for practice has assisted them to come together. Teachers have also worked with Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, to document procedures for assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Teachers support a free-choice programme. They follow children&rsquo;s emerging interests and as a team, document these daily. Planning records, displays and children&rsquo;s portfolios show how these emerging interests have been further developed to offer a range of authentic and meaningful learning experiences. The portfolios are attractively presented and accessible for parents to add their own comments.</p><p>Independence is encouraged and supported. Children take responsibility for much of their own learning, with the support of teachers. Active small groups are a feature of the programme. Children gather their own resources and sustain their play for considerable periods of time. Interactions between teachers and children are positive and affirmative. Language development is fostered through extended conversations between adults and children and the frequent reading of familiar stories.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported through the kindergarten programme, the expertise of the Educational Social Workers (ESW) and the use of Individual Education Plans (IEPs). Most of the special needs children have the services of an ESW for some of the hours of each day they attend. Good strategies are outlined in the IEPs to assist teachers. Children with allergies are protected through established and well-implemented safety procedures.</p><p>Parents and children are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. A family atmosphere is promoted. Parents are comfortable to stay with their child and participate in the activities provided. Teachers make themselves available to talk with parents about their child or matters of interest particularly at the beginning and end of the day. Teachers report that a stronger, supportive partnership between the kindergarten and the community is developing.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The team acknowledges that most systems and practices are in the early stages of development and implementation. The senior teacher is helping to promote understanding of self review to strengthen assessment, programme planning and evaluation. This guidance is likely to extend teachers&rsquo; skills in recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s deep learning over time and their developing dispositions.</p><p>The kindergarten building and resources are urgently in need of a major clean, upgrade, refurbishment or replacement. The limited amount of storage in all areas of the kindergarten impacts on the accessibility of resources. These improvements, once undertaken, are likely to assist children to care for and show greater respect for the resources and the environment.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Tawa Central Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre<em>Management</em>Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO, the centre managers and the senior teacher agree that:</p><ol>
<li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-tawa-central-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Tawa Central Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Tawa Central Kindergarten.</p><p>Tawa Central Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community. The senior teacher has worked with this kindergarten and community for the past eighteen months.</p><p>There have been many changes since the 2008 ERO review. Staffing has increased now that the kindergarten has three all-day sessions for older children and two half-day sessions for younger ones. The head teacher has been in her position for the past two years and the teaching team for the last 18 months. As a result of these changes, most systems are an early stage of development and implementation.</p><p>Teachers have given considerable thought to developing their philosophy to have a collective understanding of the principles and beliefs that underpin their behaviour and teaching practices. They have also developed written procedures to guide their use of Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation. Undertaking these processes has assisted teachers to come together as a team.</p><p>Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s independence. A free-choice programme operates, with children taking responsibility for much of their own learning. Active small groups are a feature with children gathering their own resources and sustaining their play within the group for considerable periods of time. Interactions between teachers and children and among children are positive and affirming.</p><p>Staff build on and extend children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Documentation on the planning wall and in children&rsquo;s portfolios indicates that authentic and exciting projects have involved children and parents in the past year. Portfolios are accessible for parents who are encouraged to add their own comments.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by the senior teacher as they work to embed their systems, develop a greater understanding of self review and make more use of their evaluation information to respond to children&rsquo;s learning. Good provision is made for children with special needs, with teachers working in partnership with families and other agencies.</p><p>The active parents&rsquo; committee is fundraising to upgrade and refurbish the kindergarten and resources.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
