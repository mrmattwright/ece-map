</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rata Street is a community-based preschool operating age-grouped morning and afternoon sessions. The centre is licensed for 37 children aged over two and has a roll of 90. An active committee, representative of the community, employs four qualified, registered teachers and an administrator. Ministry of Education support workers provide additional assistance for children with special needs.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy of ‚ÄòWe Play, We Learn, We Grow‚Äô is the foundation for committee operations, the curriculum and parent and whƒÅnau involvement. Some families travel for up to an hour to attend, while others live in the immediate area. The rural location of the preschool and its diverse community are very evident in the values, levels of respect and experiences associated with the natural environment.</p><p>Since the December 2009 ERO report the preschool‚Äôs building and outdoor play area have been extended. Improvements were fully funded and managed by parents and whƒÅnau, resulting in a well-planned and presented facility that is a source of pride for children and adults. The supervisor, teaching team and management committee have continued to promote high quality care and education through regular review and strong leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children bring a wide range of interests and experiences to their play. They persevere, using imagination and follow group or individual choices. Teachers respond by talking with children and extending their ideas through questions. Opportunities to read, write and explore number are promoted. Teachers closely observe play and plan the curriculum as children‚Äôs curiosity follows different pathways. Social skills are modelled and children manage and make their own decisions calmly. They are confident problem solvers.</p><p>The preschool environment invites exploration. Resources include natural materials and carefully selected items that children can adapt for many purposes. There is ample room for children to move about or to enjoy quiet time. Children and parents frequently share the contents of portfolios and the vibrant work displayed in the play areas.</p><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed as they arrive each day. There is relaxed conversation between teachers and family members. Transition into the centre is flexible so that adults and children can get to know each other. A comprehensive and sensitive process assists children to settle confidently into new entrant classes at a large number of schools. Transition practices are a particular strength of this centre. The preschool committee and teachers identify that sustaining and growing community links and understanding of transition is an ongoing important priority for them.</p><p>MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau are leaders in bicultural learning at the preschool. Their language, culture and identity have a special place in the environment and programme. Bicultural practice is woven throughout the day's programme. A Kaiawhina employed by the centre adds to teachers‚Äô knowledge and liaises between the centre and the neighbouring school. Parents speak of choosing the preschool because their ideas and wishes are valued and whƒÅnau experiences have been positive over a long period of time.</p><p>Children with special needs participate happily and confidently. Adults assisting them understand their strengths and the challenges they face. When required, outside expertise supports parents, children and teachers.</p><p>Parents willingly, in ways that suit their family circumstances, give their time to the preschool. Every contribution is valued and adds to the children‚Äôs experiences and to teachers‚Äô learning. Adults move unobtrusively in and out of the centre, joining in play and often bringing new activities, such as weaving, to the curriculum. Parents enjoy support from each other and from teachers. Relationships are positive, encouraging and respectful. Continuing to increase parent participation is highly valued and a strong ongoing focus of the committee and teachers.</p><p>A committee capably sets clear direction for future development and a workable framework for teachers and parents to realise the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Reviews carried out by teachers or the committee have a strong focus on teaching and learning and outcomes for children's education and care. A range of perspectives and information is gathered and analysed. Children‚Äôs ideas have the same importance as adults. WhƒÅnau and parents‚Äô hopes and values are part of decision making.</p><p>The supervisor leads an improvement-focused teaching team. Professional development is purposeful and includes teachers improving their knowledge to cater for children with more complex needs. Teachers communicate their enthusiasm for learning, to the children and their parents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The preschool committee, teachers and ERO agree that to sustain current good practice, the centre should continue to further develop self-review practices and use these to identify and support best professional teaching practice for children and their families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Rata Street Pre-school completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rata Street Pre-school will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
