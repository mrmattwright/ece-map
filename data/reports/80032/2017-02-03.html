</table><p>Although some progress has been made under new ownership, ERO continues to have concerns about governance and management practices. Ongoing external support is essential to continue and sustain improvements in all areas of centre operations.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tino-E-Tasi Preschool is one of two privately owned centres operating under the same name. They promote Samoan language and culture. The centre employs a qualified teacher who is returning from a break in teaching service, two provisionally registered teachers, one trainee teacher and an administrator.</p><p>In the past year the centre has experienced significant change with new ownership, ongoing staff turnover and a reorganisation of staff roles. The supervisor's position is currently vacant. The owner/director is keen to improve the sustainability of the centre by establishing a new strategic plan and restructuring staff roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Tino-E-Tasi Preschool has had a long history of supplementary ERO reviews, despite extensive support from the Ministry of Education (MoE) and other providers. Since the 2013 ERO review the centre has received external support to help address concerns in relation to curriculum, governance and management. The centre was placed on a full license in 2014. Some good progress is evident in aspects of teaching and learning. However, ongoing staff turnover and leadership changes have hindered improvement. ERO continues to have concerns relating to a lack of progress in governance and management. The MoE has offered to facilitate professional learning and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly and have respectful interactions with adults. They are engaged in programme experiences and know routines well. Infants and toddlers have opportunities for uninterrupted play and explore the environment freely. They have good access to equipment and resources.</p><p>A shared leadership model has recently been established to improve the use of teachers' strengths and grow the collective capability of the team. Samoan language is strongly evident in the environment and in teaching practices. Joint leadership in curriculum and Samoan language and culture could help to build a shared team vision. The curriculum leaders have a growing understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, as well as tikanga and te reo Māori. Including <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> in teachers' appraisals could support teachers to evaluate how well they promote bicultural practices.</p><p>Teachers have attended professional development that has helped them to improve teaching practices and their understanding of internal evaluation. They have strengthened their provision for literacy and mathematics as a result of consultation with parents.</p><p>Teachers agree that next steps to support improved teaching and learning should include external networking and professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy and the programme for children up to two years of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the learning environment is well resourced to challenge and extend children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre director has extensive management experience and is developing an understanding of centre governance and management. He agrees that the improvements needed include the development of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>robust systems to monitor the implementation of health and safety procedures and manage risk analysis for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance appraisals for all staff that supports improved practice and shared understandings about effective teaching and bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies and procedures to reflect legal requirements, particularly in relation to employment practices and police vetting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emerging shared leadership and reflective professional practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning and internal evaluation to guide improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial planning and management, including sharing annual audit reports with the community.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tino-E-Tasi Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>governance and management, including financial management, personnel and employment practices and risk analysis for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies, procedures and provision for health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS31,17,18; GMA6,7,7A; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 47(1a,c(i),e).</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Tino-E-Tasi Preschool. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tino-E-Tasi Preschool will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
