</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Vickery Street is a full-day, licensed education and care service located in Te Rapa, Hamilton. It is licensed to cater for 75 children, including 25 children up to the age of 2 in four age-based areas. At the time of this ERO review there were 75 children on the roll, including 9 children who identified as MƒÅori. The centre is providing education and care for families in the industrial area from several different ethnicities.</p><p>Since the 2012 Education Review the centre has experienced two changes of ownership and is now owned by Evolve. The centre operates under the governance and management of the Lollipops organisation who place priority on the provision of high-quality services and positive learning outcomes for children and their families. The centre continues to be managed under the same leadership.</p><p>The centre has sustained its areas of strengths identified in the previous ERO report and has responded positively to the identified areas for development related to reporting and clarifying leadership roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The centre exceeds Ministry of Education requirements teacher qualification and adult to children ratios.</p><p>The service places priority on respectful and nurturing relationships with children and their family/whƒÅnau. They aim to foster wonder and curiosity for life-long learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning and care outcomes for children and their family/whƒÅnau because of:</p><ul>
<li>effective governance and management, which provide policy direction and professional development for the centre</li>
<li>experienced leadership</li>
<li>a positive and well-qualified teaching team who work well together</li>
<li>a child-centred curriculum guided by a clear philosophy.</li>
</ul><p>Children enjoy and participate in a programme that identifies and responds to their interests and strengths. The learning environment is well designed to promote active learning and enables children to make choices, explore, take risks and experiment from a wide range of high-quality, opened-ended equipment and materials.</p><p>The curriculum places priority on the provision of natural resources, flexible routines that respond to children‚Äôs needs, and the integration of literacy and mathematics. Teachers are increasingly including te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in meaningful contexts of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning and development is recorded in individual profile books and attractive centre displays. Families are encouraged to share their views and aspirations for their children. There are some good models of assessment and planning. This information is being effectively used to inform teacher planning for the environment, and identify opportunities teachers provide for children.</p><p>Children up to the age of two experience calm, peaceful and unhurried nurture and care, which is influenced by the Pikler philosophy. This approach places importance on a primary care teacher who has particular oversight and responsibility for identified infants and toddlers and their families. Babies and toddlers are confident and are encouraged to grow and develop at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers consistently involve themselves in children's play in well-planned and prepared environments. They have established positive, respectful relationships with families/whƒÅnau and children. Teachers have many conversations with children that promote their oral language development, problem solving and social skills.</p><p>Effective leadership for this centre is evidenced by:</p><ul>
<li>experienced personnel providing support for business, human resource management and curriculum advice</li>
<li>highly professional and reflective leadership from the centre manager who fosters emergent leadership amongst teachers, and provides relevant feedback to teachers to build their practice</li>
<li>sound leadership from team leaders for the age-based areas.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>While self review is leading to improvement at all levels of centre operations, it would be more effective by setting clear and specific expectations for practice and making greater use of Ministry of Education resources and guidelines.</p><p>ERO have identified the need to further review and refine assessment, planning and evaluation practice. Development should include:</p><ul>
<li>clearer analysis of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>more specific planning of teaching practice or strategies that build and extend on children's learning</li>
<li>documenting the outcomes for children and their families of the planned transition process</li>
<li>more formal opportunities for families to be involved in the learning partnership</li>
<li>clear acknowledgement of and inclusion of the language, culture and identity of every child.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Vickery Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Vickery Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>26 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
