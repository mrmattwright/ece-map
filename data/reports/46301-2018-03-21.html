</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Village Kids Home Based is a home-based education and care service located in Havelock North, Hawkes Bay. The roll of 67 children includes eight who identify as Māori. The service is one of two Village Kids home-based care networks in Hawkes Bay. It is part of the Village Kids early childhood services.</p><p>A director and management coordinator oversee service operation. The quality of education is the responsibility of three coordinators who are qualified early childhood teachers.  A childcare consultant supports relationships with parents and whānau when they enrol their children, by providing a key point of contact.</p><p>The service has responded well to the areas for development identified in the March 2015 ERO report.  These included: reviewing how culturally responsive teaching is supported and embedded into the programme; and strengthening coordinators' appraisal process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Village Kids Homebased is improvement-focused and committed to providing high quality education and care. Well-aligned systems and processes contribute to improvement, sustainability and positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the Village Kids organisation PAUA beliefs of:  the importance of play, appreciating others, understanding your attitude and attention to others. The philosophy is well known and reflected at all levels of the service.</p><p>Coordinators support educarers to provide a high quality programme, underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Educarers offer a wide range of learning experiences within the home environment and community, to support and extend children's interests. They encourage children’s input into and enjoyment of the learning process. Children's engagement and participation in the programme is well captured through a range of documentation.</p><p>Coordinators provide comprehensive support to educarers to undertake assessment, planning and evaluation. They model best practice through regular visits, playgroups and special events. This successfully contributes to responsive teaching and positive outcomes for children. There is a focus on supporting educarers understanding of and capability for working with <em>Te Whāriki</em>.  </p><p>The service has strengthened the integration of te ao Māori through the curriculum. Educarers are supported to build their knowledge and understanding of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Incorporating local places of cultural significance into teaching and learning has been identified as a next step. ERO's evaluation confirms this, to make the curriculum more inclusive for Māori children.</p><p>Parents are valued partners in their child’s learning. Coordinators know the children and their families well. Regular sharing of information enables the service to incorporate what parents value for their child’s education and care.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are well supported through a carefully considered placement process responsive to the needs of the children and their parents. This successfully contributes to these young children's sense of belonging and need for secure attachments.</p><p>The service actively works with external agencies to provide a programme that appropriately responds to those children who require additional learning support. There is a well-considered approach to the placement of these children with an educarer.</p><p>A highly collaborative culture prevails. The skills, strengths and expertise of the team are valued and acknowledged through very clear roles and responsibilities. Opportunities for leadership are promoted. A robust appraisal process for coordinators contributes to their ongoing professional growth and development as teachers. Evaluation requires strengthening to determine the impact coordinator support has on educarer practice and how this improves outcomes for children.</p><p>Key systems to guide centre operation and practices have been established, with a regular cycle of review. A well implemented review process contributes to improvement, sustainability and positive outcomes for children. Leaders agree that strengthening evaluation should enable them to better know what is working, or not working and for who and why.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to strengthen internal evaluation and strategies that support success for Māori as Māori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Village Kids Home Based completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Village Kids Home Based will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>21 March 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
