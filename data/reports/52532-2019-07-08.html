</table><p>All About Kidz Childcare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>All About Kidz Childcare is located in Feilding. It is a privately-owned service that has up to 65 children, including 16 up to the age of two years. Of the 57 children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori.</p><p>The service operates across two sites, with separate learning spaces designed specifically for different age groups.</p><p>The centre owner/manager has oversight of the day-to-day running of the service. She is supported by one assistant manager/supervisor and two other supervisors. The majority of staff are qualified and registered.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises positive relationships and respectful partnerships to support lifelong independent learners.</p><p>The service has responded well to areas for development identified in the July 2016 ERO report that identified: review of the philosophy; assessment for learning; te ao MƒÅori; appraisal; and internal evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recent in-depth review of the philosophy has identified what is valued most for children attending the service and resulted in a shared understanding of this. Many elements of the philosophy are highly evident in practice.</p><p>Children learn in a calm, welcoming, language-rich environment where physical activity, early literacy and mathematical concepts are promoted. The development of their social and emotional competencies is appropriately responded to and well supported. Established routines provide structure to the day. Children know centre routines and expectations well and these contribute to their sense of belonging.</p><p>Children use the spacious outdoor and indoor environments well. A good range of age-appropriate resources support their ongoing interests. They lead their own learning and engage in play for sustained periods of time. A programme for four-year-olds is focused on developing competencies that are most likely to support their successful transition to school.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured in a calm, stress-free environment. The focus on free movement enables them to actively explore, investigate and take risks. Teachers are attuned to infants' non-verbal cues. Care routines are sensitive and respectful.</p><p>Children are well supported to transition within the centre through processes that are responsive to each child and their family. This contributes to flexible practices that promote children‚Äôs ongoing sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>A strategic focus and deliberate strategies are strengthening teacher‚Äôs knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and its integration in the programme. This continues to be an ongoing focus.</p><p>A collaborative approach is strengthening the consistency of planning for individual children. There is a greater emphasis on discussing and recording what teachers know about children‚Äôs learning to better respond to their ongoing strengths, interests and ways of learning. Ensuring that children‚Äôs learning is evident and visible has been identified by leaders as an area for ongoing development. Further professional engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em> should support teachers to better identify learning outcomes for children and strengthen their knowledge of relevant theories and practices.</p><p>The service's response to the areas for development identified in the previous ERO report has been well-considered and managed. Strategic planning linked to five key performance indicators identifies centre priorities going forward. This contributes to better alignment and coherence of systems, processes and practices across the service. Leaders have identified that ongoing implementation and embedding of changes to achieve the desired level of consistency across the service remains a priority.</p><p>A policy review cycle is established and evident in the annual plan. The policy review process needs strengthening to ensure that parents, whƒÅnau and staff have access to current policies and procedures.</p><p>The newly implemented appraisal process is aligned to updated legislative requirements and provides opportunities for teachers to inquire into their practice. Review is used well to inform change and improvement. Strengthening the inquiry process and developing a shared understanding of internal evaluation across the service should enable leaders and teachers to know the impact of improved systems, process and practices on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have identified the need to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to embed newly implemented systems, processes and practices to ensure consistency across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to strengthen te ao MƒÅori within the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen their understanding and use of inquiry and internal evaluation to know what is working and what needs to change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017 to</em> better respond to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the policy review process to ensure policies are up to date and available to parents.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of All About Kidz Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>8 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
