</table><p>Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whānau Aroha is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The appointment of a suitable person to permanently fill the key leadership position has recently been made. While good progress is evident in improving practice and operation since the March 2017 ERO report, concerns about sustainability of the improved practices remain.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whānau Aroha is a not-for-profit Christian-based early learning service operating under the umbrella of the Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust Board. It is licensed for 50 children, including 20 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review, all children enrolled are Māori. They are catered for in two age-related groups and separate learning spaces. Regular interaction between age groups is promoted.</p><p>Day-to-day operation is the responsibility of a manager, who reports to a regional director. She also shares responsibility with the team leader for curriculum implementation and guiding teaching practice. The manager’s position has been temporarily filled by the leader of another service. A permanent appointment to this role was made after the on-site stage of this ERO review. Interim management support for operation was also in place. Five registered teachers (kaiako) and four support workers make up the teaching team. There has been significant staff turnover in the past six months.</p><p>Hauora Health, Plunket, a mobile dental service, ear specialist and social worker are made available to whānau for tamariki. Free transport is offered to support children's regular attendance. Around half of the families use this service.</p><p>Concerns about the quality of operation were identified in the previous four ERO reviews. Leaders and kaiako have been engaged in a range of professional learning and development (PLD), through a Ministry of Education Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) contract and other sources. The centre regained its full licence in 2017. Ongoing PLD remains in place. Progress has been made in improving teaching and learning. Serious non-compliance with regulations has been addressed. Some aspects of practice continue to require development.</p><p>The new centre philosophy is child focused and emphasises the importance of acknowledging the dual cultures of Aotearoa, children's wellbeing and identity and Christian values.</p><p>Since the March 2017 ERO report the learning spaces have been reconfigured to improve supervision and flow. Plans have been approved for the refurbishment of the outdoor area.</p><p>A strategic review of services under Anglican Social Services is being undertaken. Increased emphasis on centralising operation, consistency of practice in early childhood services, and improving provision of social services are the desired outcomes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Equity in relation to child outcomes is strongly supported through the board's enduring focus on removing barriers to participation in the service. Free transport and access to a range of social services support children's attendance and wellbeing. A variety of communication initiatives enable whānau to have equitable access to information about their children's participation and learning, and have input into decision making.</p><p>The values identified in the revised philosophy underpinning teaching and learning are strongly evident in the programme. Children are encouraged to freely explore play spaces and materials to support their interests. Māori children's success as Māori is acknowledged, understood and meaningfully facilitated. Their whakapapa is celebrated. Whānau aspirations are sought and valued as a basis for individual development planning. Children have fun and are well supported to be self-managing learners.</p><p>Te ao Māori is strongly evident in the programme and environment. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are woven throughout the learning experiences enjoyed by the children each day. Leaders agree that researching aspects of significance to Māori in the local area and integrating this information into the programme is a next step.</p><p>Kaiako are respectful and positive in their interactions with children. They report an improved tone to the programme as a result of the recent review of behaviour management practices. Professional learning and development, and ongoing collaborative reflection and discussion, have informed a more consistent approach supported by shared understanding of effective practice.</p><p>Provision for children aged up to two years is carefully considered. Consistency of staffing promotes children's attachment and wellbeing. Routines are flexible and based on individual's rhythms. Relationships with kaiako are close and trusting. These young children have their own dedicated play space and resources and the programme also supports their interaction with the older age group. Tuakana teina relationships are encouraged.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are welcomed and appropriate steps taken to support their participation. Leaders acknowledge that provision for children from Pacific ethnic groups and their families requires strengthening. Up-to-date Ministry of Education resources have been accessed to support this development.</p><p>Children's transitions into, through and out of the service to school are planned for and supported by kaiako. Their approach includes ongoing consultation with parents and the identification of key staff to support individual children. Further work is planned to strengthen children's transition to school. This should include building more purposeful relationships with local schools to assist with the sharing of information about individual children and support continuity in their learning.</p><p>Planning for learning is supported by new leadership and recent PLD about the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Long-term goals for individuals are identified in collaboration with whānau and are inclusive of their aspirations. Planning also acknowledges the importance of noticing, recognising and responding to individual children's emerging interests. Priorities for kaiako are to strengthen the focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>individual children's significant learning and how they are promoting their progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrating a bicultural perspective in children's learning records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to support the everyday participation and input of whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making evaluation of the programme more manageable and meaningful in relation to identifying next steps for aspects of teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders agree they should also further define the priorities they have identified for children's learning to highlight these in their assessment practice.</p><p>The teaching team is largely new and still establishing agreed ways of working. Teachers demonstrate a sense of purpose and commitment to improvement. Kaiako and interim leaders have worked well together to implement the learning programme. Progress is being made in improving the quality of teaching, learning and operation. Regular meetings support the sharing of ideas and a team approach to programme development. An action plan gives focus and direction.</p><p>The appraisal process provides good support for kaiako development. A revised approach in 2018 incorporates Teaching Council requirements. Practices for endorsing kaiako practising certificates are appropriate. Suitable mentoring and induction processes are in place to support provisionally certificated kaiako meet fully certification requirements.</p><p>Review is valued as a tool to improve outcomes for teaching and learning. A useful internal evaluation framework has recently been adopted. Kaiako and leaders now need to develop their understanding and use of this framework to support more effective decision-making about change and improvement.</p><p>Some sound governance and management practices are in place. Regular reporting about key aspects of operation, including health and safety, is undertaken at various levels of the organisation. Documented reporting between the new manager and director should be reinstated. Practice guidelines are up-to-date. The development of a detailed strategic plan outlining long-term priorities and supported by planned internal evaluation should strengthen the sustainability of operation.</p><p>Anglican Care Waiapu is supportive and well established as a governance body, and the new Chief Executive has a strong focus on lifting quality. However, despite best efforts being made, concerns about the sustainability of improved centre practices and operation remain.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for development are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the quality of teaching and kaiako teamwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership and day-to-day management.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whānau Aroha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>guidelines and organisation for excursions are reviewed to make expectations clear, particularly in relation to adult-to-child ratios, what parents need to view and sign and risk management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sufficient and compliant impact material is in place around identified playground equipment at all times it is accessible to children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site stage of the ERO review, the service has provided evidence that shows these aspects of compliance have been addressed.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The service will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whānau Aroha will be within three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>7 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
