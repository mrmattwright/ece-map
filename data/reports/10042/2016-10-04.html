</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wee Wisdom Montessori Drury is a privately owned centre that has recently undergone significant development. Previously a small centre licensed for 26 children, it was greatly extended with the addition of three new buildings in April 2016. The service now provides full-day education and care for up to 100 children, including up to 10 children under two years old. Consequently, there are several new staff and there have been changes in roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The original centre building is now designated for children under three years old. A large new building caters for three to six year olds. A head teacher leads the staff in each of the centre areas. The site also includes a separate staff room and a community centre.</p><p>The centre is one of four in South Auckland and Paeroa operated by the owners. The service focuses on providing authentic Montessori early childhood education with a community outreach to engage families and others in different aspects of education. Teachers are well supported by an on-site centre manager, and an area manager who visits often to oversee the quality of teaching and learning, and to contribute to centre management decisions. The teaching team are registered early childhood teachers with qualifications in Montessori philosophy and practices. Teachers reflect the cultural diversity many families bring to the centre.</p><p>In 2013 ERO identified several positive features in centre practices and the need for further development in several areas including self review, assessment, the use of te reo MƒÅori and the outdoor environment. These areas remain a focus for improvement as centre leaders deliberately take a measured approach to increasing the roll, developing resources and implementing change.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Calm, carefully arranged environments enable children in this centre to make independent choices from a wide range of Montessori equipment and activities. Children work confidently with resources often in friendly groups or while focussing individually on a task. Some sustain their interest in an activity for prolonged periods and they respond well to adult support for their play. Children have opportunities to learn aspects of early literacy, numeracy and science which are integral components of Montessori programmes. They also celebrate many different cultural events and benefit when teachers include te reo MƒÅori, waiata and practices that reflect local tikanga.</p><p>Teachers working with the younger children are caring, patient and cheerful as they introduce the children to a new environment and resources. While this group is currently very small and includes only one infant under two years old, teachers are preparing suitable equipment for toddlers and a safe space for infants. Toddlers enjoy exploring the resources and are beginning to learn self-help skills, and about the tasks and expectations of Montessori programmes.</p><p>Teachers support children well to engage with the resources and make choices about what they do. Teachers guide children through the progression of Montessori equipment and encourage them to practise and master associated skills. Teachers foster children's oral language when they are working in groups or during mat-time activities. This is an area they could continue to enhance as children prepare for school.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to develop topics that are based on children's observed interests. The majority of planning, assessment and evaluation is related to Montessori resources with an increasing focus on children's interests. This developing focus should provide more meaningful contexts for children‚Äôs learning. Parents and whƒÅnau provide useful information about their child's strengths and interests which could guide teachers in their work with each child. A new digital portal that provides families with easy access to records of children's learning also provides a very good opportunity for teachers to further engage parents in learning partnerships.</p><p>The new classroom has an attractive and potentially interesting setting. While very well resourced indoors, the outdoor environment for older children has yet to be developed and further age-appropriate equipment is needed for the younger group. Centre leaders are planning staged development but need to consider regular opportunities for physical play in the interim. As children enjoy good access to the outdoors it is important that this spacious area provides a rich variety of experiences and challenge.</p><p>Systems for managing the extended service are becoming established. Strategic and annual plans have been developed, professional development opportunities for teachers have been organised and the centre philosophy and vision have been shared. Teachers are taking responsibility for ongoing self review with a commitment to providing positive outcomes for children. Parents have been surveyed to contribute ideas for future development and they have good opportunities to discuss their child's learning with teachers. Teachers are excited about a new initiative that will enhance their knowledge of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing the planned outdoor development without delay and providing suitable opportunities for physical play in the interim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the extent to which children are encouraged to explore their individual interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving children's assessment portfolios so that stories and evidence focus more on the individual child's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the appraisal process to ensure it aligns with practices and will guide teachers to gather sufficient evidence to meet certification requirements</p>
</li>
<li>developing an action plan to strengthen the implementation of the strategic plan and to ensure all policies are kept up to date</li>
<li>continuing to develop teachers' skills and knowledge in relation to te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wee Wisdom Montessori Drury completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices centre leaders should strengthen systems for managing risks on excursions from the centre.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wee Wisdom Montessori Drury will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
