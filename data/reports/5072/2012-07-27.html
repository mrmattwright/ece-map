<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Milford Kindergarten is located on the North Shore of Auckland City. Teachers provide high quality early childhood education for children over two years old. In 2011 the kindergarten changed from offering half-day sessions and now provides six-hour sessions each week day. This has resulted in fewer children being enrolled, but has improved the teacher to child ratio. The team is led by a skilful head teacher who has fostered collaborative practices and innovative approaches to teaching and learning. The service operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association which provides a policy framework and very good professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator and parent group also support teachers.</p><p>Children are confident, independent learners and communicators. They sustain their play for long periods and respond well to teachers' questions that prompt them to work collaboratively and solve problems. Children benefit from involvement in environmental projects and in gaining a growing awareness of sustainability issues, healthy eating and physical fitness. Recent opportunities for the older children to spend time each week in the adjacent bush area has further encouraged them to take learning risks, engage in challenging tasks and learn leadership skills. Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging are also nurtured through positive transitions and care routines.</p><p>Teachers promote children&rsquo;s learning effectively. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s individual and group interests and have high expectations that children will develop complexity in their play and show responsibility. Teachers respect family cultures and integrate tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori throughout the programme and the environment.</p><p>The kindergarten is an exciting learning environment. Natural materials, innovative structures, and challenging resources invite children&rsquo;s exploration and provide opportunities for them to think creatively and play in imaginative ways.</p><p>Teachers are skilled practitioners who constantly reflect on their practices to further enhance the quality of learning for children. They agree that the next priorities for development include the refinement of formal self-review processes and strategic planning, and encouraging children to set goals and assess their own progress.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the service&rsquo;s vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the centre is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Milford Kindergarten.</p><h3>How well placed is Milford Kindergarten to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Context</h4><p>Since the 2009 ERO review the kindergarten's operating hours have changed from three-hour sessions to the kindergarten day model (KDM) of one six-hour session every day. This change in 2011 increased the teaching team to four and improved adult to child ratios. Teachers participated in professional development related to the Enviro-schools project. As a result the kindergarten has established eco-friendly practices that encourage children and their families to protect the environment.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a trial of ERO&rsquo;s revised approaches to reviews in early childhood education services. The trial used a cluster approach for the reviews of five kindergartens within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>M&#257;tauranga.</strong> Teachers are well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Strengths in the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>well-paced development of the Enviro-schools project that enables children&rsquo;s interests to remain a priority</li>
<li>planning processes that integrate project work with children&rsquo;s emergent interests</li>
<li>grouping of children to recognise their developmental abilities and to monitor achievement of Te Wh&#257;riki goals</li>
<li>involvement of children in weekly programme evaluations</li>
<li>assessment portfolios that are rich records of children&rsquo;s learning, identifying individual strengths, dispositions and achievement.</li>
</ul><p>The priorities for children&rsquo;s learning are highly visible in the environment and there is a strong partnership between teachers, parents and children in developing learning experiences that are meaningful and challenging.</p><p><strong>Tikanga whakaako.</strong> Teaching and learning in the kindergarten clearly incorporate the aspirations of parents and wh&#257;nau and are guided by the interests of children. Teachers develop learning experiences that effectively:</p><ul>
<li>integrate te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and foster children&rsquo;s cultural identity and sense of belonging</li>
<li>provide opportunities for children to learn leadership, negotiation and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>enable children to develop complexity in their play through projects and creative use of the environment</li>
<li>incorporate literacy, numeracy and science learning in meaningful contexts.</li>
</ul><p>These features make a significant contribution to the positive outcomes children experience at Milford Kindergarten.</p><p><strong>Pou Whakahaere.</strong> The Auckland Kindergarten Association provides sound governance for the kindergarten and has several systems to support the management of the centre. Features of the management at Milford Kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi in policies and practices</li>
<li>very positive attitudes to the change to the KDM model that have maximised the benefits of operating longer sessions</li>
<li>appropriate documentation and processes to monitor the health, safety and well-being of children.</li>
</ul><p>The professional services manager (PSM) provides very good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Through her regular visits she monitors the quality of teachers' practices, facilitates support through cluster group meetings and raises awareness of Association services, documentation and expectations. Her feedback through head-teacher appraisals and visit reports contributes to teachers' self review and strategic planning. Association leaders agree they should continue to help teachers to use their long-term plans to become more strategic in their approach to self review.</p><p><strong>Pou &#256;rahi.</strong> The head teacher provides effective leadership for the kindergarten. Her inclusive practices empower the teaching team to work collaboratively and share responsibility for operating the kindergarten. The complementary skills of the four teachers are used well to create a cohesive team that shares a passion for working with children on environmental projects and sustainability.</p><p>The PSM recognises the strengths of the team. She has supported teachers' involvement in several professional development initiatives and challenges them to seek new ways to extend their own learning and leadership skills.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The teachers and ERO agree the next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing refinement of self-review processes to streamline teacher reflections and foster an holistic approach to review</li>
<li>projecting the strategic plan over three to five years</li>
<li>introducing pepeha as part of building relationships with families and wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>encouraging children to more formally identify their own learning goals and plan strategies for achieving them.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Milford Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
