</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Wairaka Playcentre is a sessional centre providing education and care for children from birth to six years of age. It is located in Whakatane and caters for families drawn from the wider, more diverse surrounding community.</p>
<p>The centre operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (EBOPPA) and is licensed for 25 children, including up to 15 under two years. At the time of this ERO review 20 children were enrolled including three of MƒÅori descent and two Samoan children. Members are committed to providing a child-centred programme within a supportive family-friendly environment.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 ERO review there have been extensive improvements to the outdoor environment. An increased number of members actively studying the courses available has resulted in greater parent understanding of early childhood education. A good proportion of members have playcentre qualifications. The centre has been operating for many years and there are second generation children on the current roll.</p>
<p>The centre has responded positively to the areas for review and development in the 2012 ERO report. Parents have attracted and retained new families and clarified administration roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The president and administrator encourage and invite parents and whƒÅnau to take an active role in their children‚Äôs learning and centre organisation. There is an inclusive leadership approach with members sharing roles and responsibilities and they benefit from an experienced, knowledgeable supervisor. The centre promotes the playcentre philosophy of <em>'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi - families growing together'</em>, and a commitment to te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is very evident. Parents ensure that their children participate in high quality early childhood educational experiences.</p>
<p>Parents have created a warm and friendly environment where a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing is highly evident. Children learn and play in a purpose-built environment that is spacious, planned and inviting. The learning areas are well prepared and offer children a wide range of easily accessible choices. It is important that centre members regularly review these learning areas in order to assess their ongoing effectiveness.</p>
<p>Children play well in mixed-age groups. They confidently interact with other children and adults. Routines are flexible to meet children‚Äôs individual needs, while providing a familiar structure to the sessions. End of session discussions are used to reflect on learning that has occurred for individual children and plan future sessions. Parents encourage children to engage in their imaginative and dramatic play, and work alongside them to support and provide positive guidance.</p>
<p>The committed, knowledgeable group of parents support and promote independence so that children grow in confidence and competence, and show high levels of engagement and persistence. Children are gaining high quality and meaningful literacy and numeracy experiences in naturally emerging contexts within the print-rich environment. Individual profile books reflect children‚Äôs progress and development and are readily accessible for children to revisit and share. Centre members have identified the need to strengthen the integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within the programme.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation provides overall guidance, support and strategic direction for the local association and centres. The EBOPPA aims to grow and sustain parent membership and is proactive in supporting local events and activities. There are clear policies, procedures and guidelines for self review, assessment, planning and evaluation. Playcentre workshops help parents establish strategies and practices that ensure positive educational outcomes for children.</p>
<p>At the time of this ERO review, the national federation was in the process of considering changes to the governance and management structure of the organisation. This is likely to present an opportunity for further review and improvement to communication and support for centres.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wairaka Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of Wairaka Playcentre will be in four years.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
