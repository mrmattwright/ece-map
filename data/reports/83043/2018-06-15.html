</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Flippers Early Childhood Centre (Flippers ECC) is licenced for up to 27 children, including up to nine under two year olds. Currently there are 33 children on the centre's roll. Flippers ECC is privately owned and the licensee/owner is a qualified early childhood teacher. She currently teaches at the centre and is supported by two co-managers who also teach. All teachers are trained and the majority have early childhood qualifications.</p><p>Flippers ECC's philosophy is to provide an environment which promotes learning and development for children in: social skills, achieving independence, literacy and numeracy, and being creative and conscientious about health and sustainability.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2016, the centre has made significant progress in its governance and management systems and practices, planning, assessment and evaluation, strategic and annual planning, and internal evaluation. The centre has established systems and the owner is now better assured of robust and monitored health and safety practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre effectively promotes children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Children enjoy caring and sensitive relationships with each other and their teachers. Teachers know the children well, including knowing them as learners. Careful assessment and planning for individual children guides teachers‚Äô interactions with children and how the programme is delivered. Children‚Äôs progress is well documented. The planning and programme are increasingly influenced by the centre‚Äôs learning priorities. Teachers need to evaluate the impact their teaching is having on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a beginning awareness of te ao MƒÅori. Children continue to hear and use te reo MƒÅori, especially through waiata. Leaders have included building the bicultural curriculum in their strategic plan.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for in the mixed-age group setting. Teachers are flexible and responsive to the needs and rhythms of children under two. They have frequent caring one-to-one interactions. Adjustments are made to the environment to provide greater challenge to these children as appropriate. A dedicated space for the infants and toddlers is created when needed.</p><p>Flippers ECC values the importance of working with whƒÅnau for the best outcomes for children. Teachers respectfully include the different cultures represented in the centre‚Äôs programme. Parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning and development are highly evident in the planning. Teachers keep parents and whƒÅnau well informed about the benefits of the various play and learning activities their children take part in.</p><p>Leaders are using improved systems to support teachers to assess how well teachers and leaders are promoting positive outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are reflective and motivated to keep improving their overall practices. Leaders are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>guided by useful long and short-term planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building leadership among the teachers and making good use of people‚Äôs strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working within the clearly defined roles and responsibilities to maximise their management time and skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing meaningful self-review/internal-evaluation processes to help them understand what is going well and what would benefit from further development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre needs to strengthen planning for groups of children, and evaluation of teaching. There is evidence of good practice in individual planning that will be useful for this.</p><p>Leaders need to continue to strengthen the appraisal process to ensure the ongoing professional growth of teachers and leaders.</p><p>Leaders and teachers need to further their understandings of te ao MƒÅori values to build stronger bicultural practice, as aspired to in their strategic priorities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Flippers Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Flippers Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>15 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <i>E<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">RO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a></i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
