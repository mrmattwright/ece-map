</table><p>Little Red Fox ECE¬†is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The new owner has focused on establishing and growing this network. However key aspects of practice relating to the quality of educator and teacher outcomes, and operational management, require strengthening.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Red Fox ECE is a newly established, privately owned, home-based service providing care and education in Nelson and Blenheim. The network is licensed for 80 children, including up to 80 aged up to two years. Of the 79 children enrolled, 16 are MƒÅori.</p><p>The owner/manager takes responsibility for business aspect and administration, staffing and compliance matters. Along with the manager there are two ECE qualified and registered area coordinators to support in-home educators and nannies to provide suitable care and learning programmes for children. The two coordinators have recently joined the service.</p><p>The owner is working with external organisations to organise Level 4 training for educators needing this in 2020.</p><p>The service's philosophy, recently reviewed in consultation with families, emphasises the importance of the provision of a learning environment promotes reciprocal and respectful relationships within the home-based context.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs enrolment into the network is carefully considered in collaboration with families. They benefit from ongoing opportunities for one-to-one interaction with their educators and learning alongside small groups of children in each setting.</p><p>A wide range of experiences are offered in educators' homes and the community. Documentation shows children are regularly provided with opportunities to engage in a broad curriculum. Local excursions provide an extension to the curriculum and enrich children‚Äôs learning. Leaders provide opportunities for children and educators to regularly meet and learn in a variety of settings.</p><p>Educators focus on children's emerging interests. Infants and toddlers and children with additional learning needs are well supported with responsive and attentive caregiving to help them participate in the programme. Parent relationships are valued.</p><p>Assessment documentation shows children‚Äôs engagement and participation in a home-based setting and celebration of their developmental milestones. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing clear expectations of the purpose and use of assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coordinators providing targeted guidance to educators to further their understanding of the assessment for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Planning for learning processes have recently been revised to better reflect a strengthened focus on individual children‚Äôs interests. The next step is to measure the impact of these activities on children‚Äôs learning to support decisions about further development of the programme.</p><p>Educators receive a monthly report of the coordinator's visit. These need to better show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a specific focus on each child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evidence that parent aspirations are reflected in the assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how the coordinator is supporting the educator to develop their practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Sharing these reports with parents and gaining their perspectives would also be useful.</p><p>Leaders support educators to build their knowledge of a bicultural curriculum through the provision of resources and excursions. Coordinators modelling the use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori through practice and documentation should better support educators to grow their confidence and use of these practices.</p><p>The owner has established a relationship with the local kohanga reo and marae. Drawing on this expertise should assist in developing and documenting a curriculum reflective of places of significance to MƒÅori.</p><p>A useful framework guides the review of network operation. A consultative approach is evident. Deepening the level of analysis of data and forming stronger judgements about the effectiveness of practices should enhance the process.</p><p>Health and safety requirements need to be better monitored through consistent documentation of service requirements. ERO's evaluation identified some examples of processes not fully completed. Leaders should have a stronger emphasis on verifying that all aspects for compliance are completed on their visits to educator homes. At this time the service provider cannot be assured that these are well implemented in all educator homes.</p><p>An appropriate process is in place to appraise the owner/manager in her role. The manager has an external appraiser. An annual collaborative appraisal has occurred. This shows a meaningful process to support her development as she moves into a leadership role to support the recently appointed coordinators</p><p>Educator appraisals are completed annually. The process appropriately incudes parent comment, some self-reflection by the educator on aspects of their practice and manager comment. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a deliberate focus on developing practice to make the process more meaningful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional development aligned to educator goals and the strategic direction of the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Communication systems are well developed between parents and educators. A range of guidelines are in place to support practice. A useful annual plan outlines the priorities and direction for the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support educators to implement effective planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to work on building partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen educators' understanding of te ao MƒÅori and Treaty of Waitangi-based practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop aspects of the appraisal process for educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure suitable quality assurance systems are in place to support effective practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Red Fox ECE completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>police vetting of every adult 17 years and over by the service</li>
<li>evidence that the leaders have signed as adequate the educators annual hazard plan</li>
<li>dating and signing of drills and civil defence checks as required by the service's policy</li>
<li>consistent implementation and monitoring of practices for sleeping children</li>
<li>assessment and management of risks for excursions is comprehensively and robustly documented</li>
<li>special excursions organised by management are communicated to and approved by parents</li>
<li>regularly completing all documentation relating to vehicle travel</li>
<li>record of all food served by the educator other than provided by parents for their own children.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, GMA6, HS4, HS7, HS8, HS14, HS15, HS16.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Little Red Fox ECE. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>20 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services</p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
