</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>There are two Zigzagzoo early childhood centres in Queenstown. The Academic College Group (ACG) based in Auckland, is the licensee of Zigzagzoo ECE services, having taken ownership of this service in 2014. This Zigzagzoo centre is on Henry Street, close to the main township. It is a full-day service licensed for 38 children, including 20 under two years of age.</p><p>An operations manager has overall responsibility for both centres. A manager/team leader at Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre has been appointed to support team leaders to provide learning and teaching in each of the two rooms, where children are grouped by age. She has been in her role for six months, and prior to this had been with the Zigzagzoo service in Remarkables Park for a number of years. The majority of the teaching staff are recent appointments and a further team leader position is currently vacant.</p><p>Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre has a high turnover of staff. There has been little progress with addressing the recommendations in the 2015 ERO report. There are insufficient systems to support the centre operations and ensure that positive outcomes for children can be sustained.</p><p>The centre aims to provide education and care based on philosophies that include RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers) and Reggio Emilia approaches.</p><p>The April 2015 ERO report recommended the owners, managers, leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>identify key priorities for the centre's future development</li>
<li>develop actions to achieve the centre's priorities over time</li>
<li>clarify expectations of teachers' work, roles, and lines of reporting and responsibility</li>
<li>develop a schedule for planned self review</li>
<li>align self review, appraisals, team meetings and professional development to achieve the centre's key priorities.</li>
</ul><p>Two further key priorities from the ERO report were for leaders to ensure planning for children focuses on future learning, and to develop bicultural practices, including the integration of MƒÅori perspectives into the programme.</p><p>There has been some progress with implementing aspects of the recommendations from the 2015 ERO report. It is too early to evaluate, however, the impact of changes, or to be confident in the sustainability of improved practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the centre settle well when they arrive. Teachers provide a range of interesting resources and activities to support and encourage their engagement in learning. The environment is small and well organised and teachers have made maximum use of the space available. Children work and play well together, in small groups or alongside others. Friendships between children are apparent. Children know the teachers' expectations for behaviour and routines are well established. The manager/team leader is focused on ensuring that the health and wellbeing of children is supported through establishing useful systems and teaching practices. This is particularly evident within the infant room where teachers are very responsive to the needs of the children. Teachers work along-side children and engage in purposeful conversations that are affirming and help extend children's thinking.</p><p>The operations manager from Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre Remarkables Park has a good relationship with the manager/team leader at Henry Street. She has encouraged her to develop leadership skills and provided her with opportunities for professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for governance and management are similar to those in the 2015 ERO report.</p><p>The owners and the centre's operation manager need to ensure there are robust systems to accurately report and monitor compliance with regulatory requirements across all aspects of the centre operation at both the Zigzagzoo sites. This needs to include robust internal evaluation to inform decision-making at governance level. This should help inform key strategic and annual priorities for long and short-term centre development.</p><p>The ACG licensee needs to provide the operations manager with ongoing support and guidance to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify and differentiate between the centre‚Äôs vision, philosophy and key learning priorities</li>
<li>ensure strategic and annual planning aligns with these and ensure that progress towards identified goals is systematically monitored, documented and reported</li>
<li>clarify roles and responsibilities at this centre, of the operations manager, centre manager, team leaders, teachers and other support staff</li>
<li>develop centre-wide guidelines/expectations for teaching and learning</li>
<li>monitor and evaluate the quality of centre practices to ensure compliance with requirements</li>
<li>embed and sustain an effective appraisal system</li>
<li>continue to develop leaders' and teachers' understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><p>The operations manager needs to clearly identify and communicate centre-wide expectations for teaching and learning across both centres. The manager/team leader at this Zigzagzoo centre has been working independently to develop systems and establish practices there. The owner and operations manager need to clarify roles and responsibilities and ensure the leaders from both sites work together to achieve greater consistency across Zigzagzoo. Teaching practices need to better align to an agreed centre-wide philosophy that includes clear key learning priorities.</p><p>The manager/team leader is making progress building coherence within the new team of teachers. The operations manager needs to continue to work collaboratively with her and other team leaders across Zigzagzoo to establish effective systems that:</p><ul>
<li>align practices with the centre-wide philosophy and agreed learning priorities</li>
<li>ensure ongoing effective group and individual assessment, planning and evaluation of programmes for learning</li>
<li>help the development of bicultural practice and the further integration of MƒÅori perspectives in children's learning</li>
<li>ensure that effective appraisal processes are ongoing and fully implemented.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of compliance where practices were not satisfactory or requirements were not met. The centre owners (ACG) completed an internal Health and Safety Performance Assessment in 2017 which also highlighted areas of non-compliance identified as a risk.</p><p>The overarching concern is the lack of adequate systems and insufficient clarity around processes to identify, maintain and improve compliance with requirements.</p><p>To ensure compliance with Regulation 47, the owner needs to ensure the service is effectively governed, and is managed in accordance with good management practices. ACG and the centre manager need to ensure there are robust policies and procedures that:</p><ul>
<li>align with child protection requirements and the Vulnerable Children's Act 2014 (such as in the appointment process, GMA7A)</li>
<li>include accidents analysis and reporting (HS12)</li>
<li>are updated and comply with administration of medications requirements (HS28)</li>
<li>support robust management of risks on excursions (HS17)</li>
<li>support teacher registration and appraisals (GMA7)</li>
<li>address the risks identified in the ACG internal health and safety assessment</li>
<li>ensure regular and a consistent quality of assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning (Regulation 43, C5 and C6)</li>
<li>ensure useful strategic and annual plans are developed to guide the development of the services operation (GMA8).</li>
</ul><p>There needs to be a robust system and process to regularly review all aspects of the centre operation to ensure practices meet legal requirements and build on the quality of centre practices (GMA6).</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a comprehensive plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Zigzagzoo Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
