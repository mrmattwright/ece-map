</table><p>The service requires external support to further develop its internal evaluation practices and the quality of the learning environment for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mt Royal Learning Centre is located in Mt Albert, Auckland. The centre provides full day education and care for children from six months to five years of age. The owner is the centre manager and she leads four qualified teachers. Centre practices are inclusive and children of all ages share a large room and an outdoor area. Parents appreciate the nurturing care that staff provide for children.</p><p>The centre has not had a positive ERO reporting history. However, ERO's 2013 report noted that some progress had been made since the 2011 review. At that time ERO identified the need for the owners to develop systems for long and short term management planning and for internal evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships and interactions between children and teachers in the centre are positive. Teachers are affirming in their practice and work to build children's confidence. They ensure all children have an opportunity to participate in the programme. Although areas of play are well defined, teachers should review the learning environments. They should aim to make them more inviting for children and to have them better reflect current learning and play interests.</p><p>The condition of the outdoor learning environment somewhat limits children's opportunities to learn and play. A review of the outdoor space in 2013 has not resulted in sufficient improvement. A more deliberate approach to the management of this environment is necessary to encourage children to explore, investigate and engage in self-directed learning.</p><p>The centre has implemented a new planning process which is more responsive to children's developing interests. Portfolios contain a record of children's participation and progress. The centre manager agrees that developing more individual learning stories with greater complexity is a next step for teachers.</p><p>Recently established strategic plans guide the centre and outline the areas of practice that need strengthening. The addition of some underpinning health and safety procedures will help to make centre policies more effective. A review of key documentation including the philosophy, strategic and annual plans, and policies should be undertaken with the aim of better aligning these documents.</p><p>The centre manager supports teachers' professional practice. She agrees that the centre's existing appraisal system requires strengthening to ensure it meets the legal requirements of New Zealand Education Council. A shared approach to leadership could help with the development of a more professional learning community within the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve provision for children's care and education the owners should engage external professional support to help them to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>upgrade the learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve assessment and programme planning with a view to improving provision for children's learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement robust internal evaluation to contribute to ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review health and safety practices to align them with recent changes to legislation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review teacher appraisal policy and practices so that they are compliant with Education Council of New Zealand requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mt Royal Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>At the time of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Health and Safety. One area of concern relates to the installation of safety glass. ERO notes that this matter is now being promptly rectified.</p><p>In addition, ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, management and provision for children's health and safety. To meet requirements, the owners must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>take all measurable steps to promote children's health and safety and ensure that the environment is free from hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and improve the learning environments so that there is good quality, variety and quality of educational equipment and resources to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that teachers' performance appraisal is regular and meets the requirements of the Education Council of New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish an ongoing, systematic process of improvement focussed internal evaluation that considers all aspects of the services operation</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, PF4, GMA 6, 7 Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 46 (1).</em></p><p>To improve current practice the owners should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>household cleaning products are not accessible by children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hazards in the environment are promptly identified and removed or minimised.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mt Royal Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
