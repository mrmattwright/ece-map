</table><p><strong>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</strong></p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Te Atatu provides a full-day education and care service. Infants and toddlers are housed on one site and older children in an adjacent property. An experienced manager provides centre-wide leadership for teachers, and coordinates with head teachers who supervise in each of the two buildings. A renovation is underway to enhance the layout of the outdoor environments.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on children learning through play, and on partnerships with parents and whānau. The service has a strong bicultural commitment, and values children and families from diverse ethnicities. Centre staff reflect the diversity of the local community.</p><p>First Steps Te Atatu has a positive reporting history with ERO. Leaders and teachers are improvement focused and responsive to ERO's feedback.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven education and care service reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy and practices promote a welcoming and inclusive family-focused atmosphere. Teachers prioritise and nurture children's learning and wellbeing. All children are valued for their knowledge, strengths, talents and culture. Adults know the children very well, and their close bonds are evident in their interactions. Children are friendly and caring to each other, and show fondness for their teachers.</p><p>Children learn through play. Their interests and activities are enriched by teachers, who support them responsively. There is a relaxed yet purposeful atmosphere, where children are well supported to develop independence and leadership according to their readiness. Teachers successfully foster a happy, settled, child-led programme and centre culture.</p><p>Māori children are provided with many opportunities to connect with te ao Māori, and to share their knowledge. Teachers' confidence in using te reo Māori continues to grow. The centre manager and a Māori team member lead the development of tikanga Māori practices. Children learn and perform waiata, and regularly participate in pōwhiri to welcome visitors to their centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers participate in an unhurried programme that is responsive to their individual interests, strengths and development. Consistency in staffing supports strong relationships, and promotes the security and belonging of these young children. Teachers are calm and nurturing. A new area for the youngest infants is being trialled, where they can explore and enjoy a peaceful, dedicated space. Transition practices through the centre and for graduating children are well considered, and strongly support children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers value their partnerships with whānau in mutual support of children's learning and wellbeing. Key documents, programmes and strategies are shared to help families understand the curriculum, routines and practices. The team recognises the worth of its community, and is collaborative and respectful in its approach, working together to promote children's success.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well informed, prioritised, and understood clearly by managers. As a result of recent evaluation, internal transition practices have been reviewed and sensitively enhanced. In addition, the review of programme planning was conducted in an open and consultative way. The leaders are dedicated to ongoing improvement.</p><p>BestStart and centre managers have high expectations and commitment, and a vision for this service. Managers use a strategic approach to ensure that overarching goals and plans are well aligned with programme and practice. Internal evaluation, teachers' inquiry and professional development are thoughtfully considered so that the team has a shared understanding of established goals and how these will be achieved. Strong appraisal feedback and enhanced team culture, foster teachers' growing knowledge and capability.</p><p>BestStart has recently developed a strategic plan to guide the organisation's future direction. Managers are working to increase coherence and alignment between organisational and individual centres' annual and strategic planning. The teacher appraisal process has been redeveloped with a focus on lifting teacher practice through individual inquiry. Managers will continue to provide targeted support to ensure these documents become familiar to teachers, and contribute to improved consistency in the quality of programmes across centres.</p><p>To support the provision of a broader curriculum in the outdoors, it would be worthwhile for managers and teachers to review and improve the design and layout of these learning environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have identified appropriate next steps, including:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to weave te ao Māori through the philosophy and the planned programme, supported by whānau</li>
<li>building on BestStart's Hauora focus, to foster children's wellbeing and connections to the natural world</li>
<li>evaluating the extent to which intended outcomes for children and whānau are achieved through internal evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Te Atatu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Te Atatu will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>12 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
