<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Waikato Family Homebased Childcare Network 2 provides home-based education and care for children from birth to school age in Hamilton. Educators care for up to four children at a time in their homes and are supported by a registered early childhood teacher. The network is licensed to cater for up to 80 children at any one time and currently has 68 children enrolled, 28 of whom are babies or toddlers. It operates alongside two sister networks under the same governance.</p><p>Relationships amongst parents, educators, visiting teachers and children are positive and respectful. Children demonstrate high levels of trust and confidence in visiting teachers, educators and other children in care. Babies and toddlers benefit from nurturing interactions that support their learning and care. Educators welcome children and their families into diverse home environments. They make good use of the equipment, playgroups and gym sessions funded by the organisation, as well as the local environment, for spontaneous trips and visits.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop early concepts about literacy and number, participate in creative activities, and learn about the world around them. Their interests and strengths are recognised and responded to in age-appropriate ways. Parents are well informed about their children&rsquo;s well-being and learning through daily journals and individual portfolios. The service has established open and supportive communication practices to meet the needs of parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The recently appointed visiting teacher is establishing positive partnerships with families. She provides regular and informed support and guidance for the induction of new educators, including regular health and safety checks, as required by regulation. Collegial relationships with other visiting teachers are evident as they share responsibilities across the service. A next step is to give educators greater responsibility for ensuring the safety of their home environments.</p><p>Experienced and knowledgeable managers continue to set high standards and provide clear guidelines for visiting teachers and educators. The service uses self review to identify areas for improvement. Developing, monitoring and reviewing strategic goals for the quality of education and care is likely to lead to improved outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2008 some progress has been made in improving aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori practices in the programme for children. The organisation has identified the need to increase the consistent use of these practices by visiting teachers and educators.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below:</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Waikato Family Homebased Childcare aims to give children opportunities which will enhance their development for life, supported by educators, in warm and caring home environments. The newly appointed visiting teacher took up her position in early 2011. Educators in this network are working towards a module of the Certificate in Family Daycare. Network 2 receives standard funding. During the review, ERO reviewers visited three of the homes in the network.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Interactions amongst educators, visiting teachers and children are positive, respectful and responsive. Children are settled and demonstrate high levels of trust and confidence in their friends and educators. In some homes, children have many opportunities to make choices and follow their interests.</p><p>Educators listen to and talk with children, to hear about their ideas and extend their thinking. Frequent conversations are developing children&rsquo;s oral language and communication skills. Babies benefit from caring interactions that are responsive to their needs and preferences and which stimulate their early language development.</p><p>Parents and educators appreciate a positive partnership in caring for children. Parents are well informed about children&rsquo;s learning and care through a wide range of formal and informal communications, including information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p>The visiting teacher is establishing constructive relationships with educators. During her visits to homes and playgroups, she models good practice through her interactions with children.</p><p><strong>Learning environment:</strong> Educators provide education and care for children in welcoming home environments. In some homes babies, toddlers and older children are able to use an appropriate range of equipment that supports their learning and development. Indoor and outdoor environments allow children to explore and investigate the world around them. Some educators are skilled at using the environment to introduce children to early concepts about natural science.</p><p>Many educators attend the organisation&rsquo;s twice-weekly playgroups and weekly gym sessions for children. They also attend other activities, visit other educators and local places of interest with children. In addition, the organisation arranges and funds excursions twice a term for all educators and children. The service supports educators in their role by providing a generous variety of learning equipment and good quality nursery furniture.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> There is a planned approach to the induction and training of new educators in this network. The visiting teacher provides educators with good support through regular visits, and models the use of detailed documentation to guide their understanding about their practice in providing home-based care. She supports educators to develop confidence in recording children&rsquo;s learning in portfolios.</p><p>The programme offers children meaningful learning opportunities in home-based contexts. Aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and care experiences are recorded in daily journals, and also in individual portfolios using photographs and learning stories. Portfolios provide families and children with opportunities to share and revisit these experiences. The visiting teacher and parents are also able to contribute their voice to the portfolios.</p><p>Educators are developing their knowledge of children&rsquo;s preferred routines and interests to design appropriate daily programmes.</p><p><strong>Leadership:</strong> The experienced and knowledgeable directors continue to set high standards and provide clear guidelines for network operation. A new team leader recently took up her responsibilities to provide further support for the service. The highly reflective visiting teachers are establishing strong collegial relationships. Opportunities are available for them to participate in professional development that increases their knowledge of up-to-date practice and theory in early childhood education.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><strong>Self review:</strong> Agreed next steps for management are to improve self review by:</p><ul>
<li>documenting annual and strategic goals for the quality of education and care, and monitoring progress</li>
<li>providing visiting teachers with ongoing, documented feedback about their practice, including programme development and evaluation, as a basis for further reflection</li>
<li>supporting educators to take greater responsibility for monitoring health and safety daily in their homes to meet management's expectations</li>
<li>ensuring a consistent approach to monitoring learning environments in order to enhance the quality of learning for children.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Inclusion of M&#257;ori perspectives:</strong> As identified in the organisation's annual plan, there continues to be a need to increase the consistent inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in all programmes and practices.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service, features that are inclusive and would be of benefit to children include:</p><ul>
<li>a cooperative and inclusive approach to providing education and care</li>
<li>supportive transitions</li>
<li>professional development for visiting teachers</li>
<li>parents choosing from a range of homes</li>
<li>generous provision for furniture and equipment to support educators in the care and learning of children.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Waikato Family Homebased Childcare 2 - 2005 Ltd completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>12 December 2011</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
