<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Akoteu Fakaili Moui governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the June 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality of programme planning and implementation</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have improved management practices and self-review processes</li>
<li>the extent to which centre management have addressed issues of non-compliance identified in the 2012 report</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the centre that arise in the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Fakaili Moui operates under the governance of the Siasi O Tongan (NZ) Trust Board. The centre is governed by a management committee made up of church representatives, parents, and teachers. It is located in Mangere East and operates behind the church on a large site. The centre serves the church community, providing early childhood education and care based on Tongan language, culture and Christian values.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted the need for significant improvement to centre operations. Although good progress has been made in improving the programme and learning environment for children, the management committee has yet to fully address areas of concern linked to governance and management. External advisory support would help the management committee to be better placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>This section summarises the progress made in improving management systems and teaching practices since 2012.</p><h4><em>Programme planning and implementation</em></h4><p>Improvements in programme planning and implementation are evident. Teachers continue to nurture and enrich children&rsquo;s knowledge and use of the Tongan language. Christian beliefs and Tongan cultural practices are woven into the programme and fostered during daily group sessions. Children are familiar with language and protocols and participate with confidence. Teachers talk to children in Tongan and encourage them to respond. Staff work collaboratively to implement the centre philosophy.</p><p>Teachers have focused on improving interactions with children and modelling positive guidance strategies. Their relationships with children are warm and respectful. Established routines encourage children to be self managing and provide them with leadership opportunities. Children show a strong sense of belonging and play cooperatively.</p><p>There has been good progress in improving children&rsquo;s access to good quality resources and opportunities for play. The welcoming and relaxed environment reflects Tongan identity and culture, and acknowledges M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. It effectively supports and sustains children&rsquo;s learning and development. Children&rsquo;s physical development is promoted by easy access to an outside area that is set up with a variety of interesting activities. Children benefit from appropriate periods of uninterrupted play and can independently choose play areas and activities.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios are well presented and provide a good record of centre activities and group learning experiences. Further development for teachers in writing good quality assessments is likely to help them improve their practice.</p><h4><em>Centre management</em></h4><p>The management committee has had some external advisory support and has made some progress in improving management practices. Good practices in financial management have been established. Some improvements have been made in keeping meeting minutes, policy review and the appraisal of staff.</p><h4><em>Health and safety</em></h4><p>Most health and safety issues identified in the 2012 ERO report have been addressed. Centre managers should now monitor:</p><ul>
<li>the accuracy of records to do with sleep checks, accidents and the administering of medication</li>
<li>parent permission slips for excursions to ensure that they show minimum adult to child ratios.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Further improvements are needed to improve the programme provided for children and to strengthen the governance and management of the centre.</p><p>Staff have been developing ways to improve assessment, planning and evaluation. They have made good progress in documenting how children participate in planned activities linked to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Further improvements to the programme could now be made by:</p><ul>
<li>planning for and extending children&rsquo;s individual interests</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of the programme in fostering child-initiated learning</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of current assessment and planning practices that reflect how emerging children&rsquo;s interests inform the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The management committee could increase support for the supervisor in leading the above centre improvements.</p><p>Good use has been made of external support to develop strategic and annual plans. The management committee and staff now need to develop a collective understanding of centre directions and how they can be put into action to improve educational outcomes for children. Strategic goals could be unpacked to guide priorities for the annual development plan.</p><p>Self review is in the early stages of development. Teachers would benefit from support to strengthen their review practices so that reviews of the programme are better implemented, documented and used as tool to reflect on their practice. Regular reviews of the annual development plan would help determine the extent of progress in relation to centre priorities. The committee should ensure that appraisal processes are effective and that all staff, including the supervisor, are appraised annually by a registered teacher. Centre managers agree that external support would help them to develop useful and sustainable systems.</p><h3>Actions Required for Compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ol>
<li>establish processes for the systematic review of all aspects of centre operations<em>Source: Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 6</em></li>
<li>plan, implement, and evaluate programmes that respond to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children and demonstrate an understanding of learning and development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education<em>Source: Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 43 (a).</em></li>
</ol><h3>Development plan recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the areas for further improvement outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Fakaili Mouiwill be within two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>
