</table><p>Bellevue Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bellevue Kindergarten is situated in Newlands, Wellington. It provides all-day education and care for up to 30 children, aged over two years. At the time of this review, 7 children enrolled at the service identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of respect, quality, trust and fun. These values are underpinned by whanaungatanga, mana and kaitiakitanga.</p><p>The head teacher is responsible for managing day-to-day operation of the kindergarten and supports to the teaching team. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>Bellevue Kindergarten is governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association (the association). The chief executive and a board of trustees are responsible for the governance. A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens which includes three Pasifika kindergartens and a Pasifika home-based service with two networks.</p><p>ERO's June 2015 report identified areas requiring further development. These included deepening understanding of self review and evaluation, strengthen aspects of assessment and programme planning, extend the bicultural curriculum and promote MƒÅori and Pacific success. Purposeful progress is being made.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of nine in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a calm and unhurried play-based programme that supports their emerging interests. They are encouraged to explore and have fun with their peers. Teachers effectively use a range of intentional teaching strategies to support and extend learning. Positive and respectful interactions are evident. Younger children learn and play alongside their older peers.</p><p>Teachers recently reviewed the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy and identified some valued learning outcomes to support programme development. They should also consult with parents, whƒÅnau MƒÅori and their pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and effectively supported. Leaders and teachers work alongside their family and whƒÅnau to access external agencies when required.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are promoted in the programme. Teachers use waiata and aspects of te reo MƒÅori in meaningful group activities. WhƒÅnau expertise is used well to enrich the programme. Leaders should continue to support teachers to use te reo MƒÅori in meaningful ways with children. The teaching team has identified a need to develop a localised curriculum that celebrates places of significant value to MƒÅori and their wider community. EROs evaluation supports this next step.</p><p>Diversity is celebrated. Cultural events extend children‚Äôs learning in meaningful ways. Reflecting children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities in assessment documentation is acknowledged by the teaching team as in need of development.</p><p>The effective planning for learning framework guides teacher practice and is based on children‚Äôs emerging interests. Teachers identify what is important for learning by using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum to develop specific learning outcomes. They respond by providing purposeful learning experiences. They also work with parents and whƒÅnau to establish meaningful aspirations for their child. The teaching team continues to weave whƒÅnau and parent aspirations into their child‚Äôs assessment documentation.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. Continuing to build on the teaching team's knowledge and understanding of the internal evaluation. This should strengthen the decision making about the impact of their practices on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers are expected to inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. They successfully foster collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Systems and processes have been well developed to guide teacher‚Äôs capability and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>consult with parents, whƒÅnau MƒÅori and their Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children</li>
<li>increase use of te reo MƒÅori with children</li>
<li>develop a localised curriculum</li>
<li>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to build knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to follow the strategic direction set through T≈´manako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi Based Strategic Priority Framework.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bellevue Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
