</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A Fun Place to Be Childcare is a privately owned, purpose-built centre located near Thames. It is situated in well-maintained, spacious and attractive buildings and grounds. The centre provides all-day education and care for children up to school age. There is a separate area for children up to the age of two. In 2014 the centre extended the premises and increased its licence to cater for 42 children including a maximum of 12 children under two. At the time of this ERO review there were 64 children enrolled, including 13 children up to the age of two and 12 identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has maintained the same ownership, management and leadership structure and personnel as when reviewed by ERO in 2012. Centre leaders continue to provide a service, which places priority on positive partnerships with families from a diverse community. They are committed to employing a high proportion of well-qualified staff, many of whom have remained with the service for a number of years. There is a commitment to maintain higher than required teacher-to- child ratios in the under-two area to allow for individual care and learning moments for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The service has made good progress with the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report related to professional development for teachers, strengthening strategic planning and further documenting parent aspirations for their children. Teachers and children make good use of digital technology for research and to enhance learning. In addition the recent introduction of digital portfolios has increased the ways that families can participate in and contribute to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to empower children, support their holistic development and foster lifelong learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are welcomed into a caring, safe and inclusive environment that is focused on promoting their wellbeing and belonging. Children enjoy playing with their friends and alongside teachers in small groups of their choosing. A feature of the centre is the spacious, well-designed, natural outdoor learning environment that provides appropriate challenge and adventure for active learners. Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>a mixture of teacher-led and child-initiated learning experiences, including opportunities for older children to extend their learning through a designated programme</li>
<li>the integration of literacy, mathematics and concepts of sustainability into children‚Äôs play</li>
<li>regular trips into the local and wider community</li>
<li>well-planned and effectively managed transitions into the centre, between rooms and to school</li>
<li>an inclusive approach to children with diverse learning and health needs.</li>
</ul><p>The language, culture and identity of all children is known and evident in the centre environment and programme. Parents are encouraged to share familiar words, stories and customs from their culture to build connecting links in the centre for children.</p><p>The centre owner maintains close links with NgƒÅti Maru iwi and the centre is situated on whƒÅnau land. Meaningful MƒÅori perspectives are integrated throughout the environment, resources, programme and centre celebrations. MƒÅori tamariki are demonstrating confidence in their culture as they participate in mihi, waiata, karakia and learn about Papatuanuku and the natural world through the centre gardens and activities such as kumara planting. Tuakana-teina, reciprocal relationships are evident during times when older children and their younger siblings play together.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are able to be involved and contribute their ideas to the centre programme. They are well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and participation in the programme through the well-presented individual learning portfolios and recently introduced digital portfolios. Centre leaders invite parents to informative parent education meetings and make every effort to support families in many ways.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience nurturing and secure relationships with their teachers. Close partnerships with parents ensure that familiar home routines are maintained. This is resulting in a strong sense of wellbeing and confidence for these children. They explore the interesting indoor and outdoor environments alongside their teachers. Centre pets have added increased interest for them. Teachers of infants and toddlers need to ensure they consistently access a wide range of activities and resources that respond to their interests and development.</p><p>Teachers are a collegial and professional team. They have established positive and responsive relationships with children and families. Staff have participated in a number of professional development opportunities that have enhanced their bicultural capability, strengthened their understanding of brain development in very young children and supported team building. They meet regularly to discuss individual children‚Äôs interests and learning and to share ideas for planning the programme linked to these.</p><p>There are some good examples of effective teaching strategies that promote children‚Äôs involvement in meaningful play, support their developing social skills and foster their leadership.</p><p>An experienced and knowledgeable centre supervisor models effective teaching practice. She is contributing to a strong team culture among staff and parents. Teachers expressed appreciation for the useful support and feedback she gives to build their practice. Her leadership is being fostered as she takes greater responsibility for centre management in preparation for when the centre manager takes extended leave.</p><p>The centre manager sets clear and high expectations for the service. She has a good understanding of strategic and annual planning, and uses this knowledge effectively to continue to build a highly regarded service in the community. Self review is well embedded and leads to regular and ongoing reflection and improvement that considers relevant research and responds to the views of stakeholders. There are appropriate and comprehensive policy frameworks, guidelines and documentation to guide centre operations. Centre owners act as good employers and are highly supportive of staff. They are committed to providing a quality care and education service for families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre manager has been proactive and dedicated to foster regular and reciprocal visits to nearby schools for parents and children nearing school age. She has gathered and responded to useful feedback from primary teachers about their expectations for children‚Äôs school readiness.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>An important next step for centre development is to continue to develop a shared leadership model that strengthens teachers‚Äô understanding about key aspects of centre operations. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>centre leaders providing regular, evidence-based feedback to teachers against agreed indicators of best practice</li>
<li>increasing teachers‚Äô understanding of intentional teaching strategies that promote self-initiated and sustained play of children, and add complexity to their learning</li>
<li>finding ways to maximise the potential of centre resources to enhance children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects is likely to further support the centre to meet the intent of their centre philosophy to empower children to learn in their own way and at their own pace.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of A Fun Place To Be Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A Fun Place To Be Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
