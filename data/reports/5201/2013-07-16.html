</table><p>Central Kids Kindergarten – Tarrangower is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergarten – Tarrangower is located in Taumaranui and provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age. It is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday between 8.45am and 2.45pm, and on Wednesday between 8.45am and 1.00pm. At the time of this ERO review the kindergarten roll was 43, of whom 21 identify as Māori. These children whakapapa to a number of iwi.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella organisation, Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (known as Central Kids).</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy for learning is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> (The Early Childhood Curriculum), it reflects the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand and aspires to develop children’s life-long learning attributes and behaviours. Since the 2010 ERO review, teachers have extensively reviewed the centre philosophy. While the wording has remained the same, teachers’ knowledge and understanding about it and how it can be more effectively implemented into programmes has increased.</p><p>Teachers have continued to access whole team professional development to keep up with current practice in teaching in early childhood education. They have successfully strengthened the Māori perspective within the kindergarten porogramme. Recently, there has been one new appointment to the teaching team and a teachers’ aide has been appointed and funded by the kindergarten.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review, the kindergarten was preparing for major renovations to both the inside and outside environments.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Central Kids provides the kindergarten with a clear philosophy, vision, and expectations for practice and strategic direction. A knowledgeable and experienced professional leader from the trust oversees the quality of the service and supports staff professional practice. As part of this review ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten’s responsibilities for employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to appoint and support staff.</p><p>Children and their families’ sense of belonging and wellbeing are supported through trusting, respectful and close relationships with teachers and support staff. Teachers promote an inclusive environment that is accepting of children’s diverse abilities, interests, strengths and family circumstances. Children benefit from extensive social opportunities that encourage them to develop their communication skills, friendships and tuakana/teina relationships (taking a leadership role in the learning of others). These opportunities create a positive atmosphere for learning. Parents are encouraged to share aspirations for their child’s learning and teachers integrate these into their planning. Families spoken to by ERO value the education provided by teachers and feel informed about their children’s learning through well-documented portfolios and discussions with teachers.</p><p>ERO observed high-quality teaching interactions that encourage children to problem-solve, think critically, use their imagination and be creative. Teachers use empowering language, encouraging children to plan and expand on their ideas through their play. They actively listen to children and skilfully know when to stand back and when to respond to teachable moments.</p><p>Children experience success in their learning by teachers providing ongoing positive feedback to them about their efforts and achievements. This is supporting them to become confident, capable, self-directed learners. Children learn in meaningful and authentic learning contexts. The curriculum promotes opportunities for them to:</p><ul>
<li>be involved in sustained and complex learning</li>
<li>learn about te ao Māori, affirming Māori children’s cultural identity and developing an appreciation for New Zealand’s bicultural heritage</li>
<li>develop their understanding and knowledge of literacy, mathematics and science concepts</li>
<li>learn about their community within the wider local environment through trips, excursions and visits to the local retirement home and school.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are receiving valuable support and guidance from a highly regarded kaumātua and tangata whenua. Children’s learning is enriched by their knowledge, wisdom, stories, and sharing of tikanga and te reo Māori.</p><p>The knowledgeable head teacher provides highly effective, professional leadership. She is supported by a capable teaching team and support staff. A notable strength of the kindergarten is the quality of self-review processes and documentation. This enables teachers to research and reflect on their practice, continually improve outcomes for children, and build on existing good practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified no key next steps that the head teacher and her team had not already identified in their high level self-review processes. ERO affirms the annual goals currently being reviewed. The outcomes of these reviews are likely to continue to strengthen the quality of education and care the kindergarten provides.</p><p>ERO is confident the kindergarten leaders and teaching team have the capacity to strengthen, promote and sustain positive outcomes for all children,</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Tarrangower completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Tarrangower will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>16 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
