</table><p>While the centre has a high proportion of new members, their collective commitment coupled with strong support from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), places the service in a good position to improve and sustain good practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Korokoro Playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions about the education programme, property and equipment.</p><p>A kaitautoko, centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association’s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre has celebrated 50 years of operation. It runs one SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children’s Education) session for infants and their parents and three mixed-age sessions. All sessions are supported by an employed supervisor. Most parents attend with their children.</p><p>Many families are relatively new to this service. They are learning about playcentre philosophy and expectations. Most are in the early stages of playcentre training. Ongoing challenges are sustaining the roll and parents' commitment to training.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of play to support children’s learning, parents working collectively, and valuing parents’ skills as primary educators of their children.</p><p>In, 2011, the playcentre was relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</em></p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the Hutt Playcentre Association.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials to support the programme. A key feature of the environment is the attractive outdoor play space set in the bush. This is well used for creative and physical play.</p><p>Work areas indoors are carefully organised to support children’s investigation of materials. Centre displays include photographs and interesting things which children like to look at. Children enjoy coming to playcentre and the learning opportunities presented.</p><p>Adults are responsive, respectful and purposeful in their engagement with children. Their learning conversations integrate literacy and mathematical concepts. They also assist development of language and communication, and extend children's ideas and sustained interest in activities.</p><p>Whāriki time is much enjoyed. It allows everyone to come together to share music, movement and stories. More focus on letting children lead the programme should assist development of their creativity, self‑management and problem-solving skills. It should also support their independence in learning.</p><p>Regular visits are made to and from the local primary school’s new-entrant class. These promote sharing of information and development of relationships between the children, school and families.</p><p>A Māori perspective is evident in the centre environment and programme. The supervisor and some parents use short phrases and words in te reo Māori as they work with children. Karakia and waiata are part of the usual centre routine. Centre members express commitment to the ongoing development of this aspect of their practice. </p><p>Members continue to review and develop their approach to planning for learning. Planning meetings are well used to support understanding of playcentre and early learning, and to share information about all children. Profile books are available to children and their families. These record art work and some special moments at playcentre. Members are confident that as more of them complete higher levels of training, a stronger and more collective approach to planning should be possible.</p><p>Core group members are strongly focused on ensuring the success and sustainability of the centre. They work cooperatively to ensure management roles and responsibilities are understood and implemented. Strategic priorities have been identified to guide centre direction over time. While many parents are new to the playcentre, strong commitment and a sense of unity and community are evident.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It aims to promote independence in management at centre level. Self review is valued as part of this process. Good association tools and frameworks are in place to support members to meet legislative requirements, and to think about their practice and how it might be improved. At this centre, use of these tools and understanding of self review are at an early stage.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members agree that further development is needed to strengthen key aspects of their practice. Particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>allowing children more opportunity to lead the programme, direct learning and make decisions about their participation</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation practice by</li>
<ul>
<li>continuing to develop understanding of children’s learning linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>in consultation with parents, giving priority to showing individual children’s significant learning and learning needs in profile books, session evaluations and planning</li>
<li>identifying next learning steps linked to these special moments</li>
<li>showing progressions of learning for individuals</li>
</ul>
<li>building shared understanding and use of self review. Support to use association frameworks and to understand those that build quality is a next step.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Korokoro Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Korokoro Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region (Acting)</p><p>29 August 2013 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
