</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids Harrison St provides sessional or full-day education and care for children, five days a week. It is licensed for 90 children, including 25 up to two years of age. Of the 75 currently enrolled, 19 identify as Māori. The centre is organised into three rooms, including a separate area for children up to two years of age.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships, a sense of family and connections to the local community.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Ltd, which provides overall strategic direction and systems to guide and manage centre operations.</p><p>Significant changes in local and regional leadership have occurred since the September 2013 ERO report. A business manager and newly-appointed professional services manager oversee the centre. Daily operation is delegated to a centre manager, supported by three head teachers who oversee curriculum implementation. Most teaching staff are fully qualified.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified key next steps to strengthen evaluative self review, appraisal and teacher inquiry. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based curriculum designed to support their emerging learning dispositions. The environment is suitably designed and resourced to encourage exploration. Regular excursions and events promote children's connections to the local community. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and many are involved in sustained play.</p><p>Teachers use a range of strategies to facilitate children's language development, extend their thinking and reinforce social competence. Children are confident and increasingly take ownership of their learning.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are purposefully woven throughout the programme. Children engage with te ao Māori resources. Leaders have identified that increasing the meaningful use of te reo Māori is necessary to further strengthen the bicultural curriculum. ERO affirms this action.</p><p>Infants and toddlers readily participate in a largely teacher-led programme. Some opportunities exist for these children to initiate and make choices about their play. Establishing a shared understanding of how to support infants and toddlers to lead their own learning is a key next step.</p><p>The inclusion of children with additional learning needs is effectively promoted through a range of strategies. Teachers support whānau to connect with external agencies and work alongside them to progress positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The interests of groups of children are regularly noticed and responded to. Teachers are beginning to evaluate how well their planned teaching strategies influence learning outcomes. Establishing assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children is a key next step. Development of this process should include:</p><ul>
<li>consistently demonstrating children's progress over time, including increased complexity and depth of learning</li>
<li>clearly addressing parents' aspirations for their children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>Relationships with parents and whānau are strong. Teachers acknowledge the need to further build understanding of how to foster educational success for Māori and for children of Pacific heritage. Growing learning partnerships, where parents effectively contribute to the curriculum, should allow teachers to better respond to children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy has consolidated teacher and whānau beliefs about the importance of well-being for their children. Staff are yet to fully explore what this means for teacher practice and priorities for children's learning. Completing this work should enable stronger alignment between the philosophy, curriculum and strategic direction.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to grow their practice. They have regular opportunities to participate in professional learning. Some useful strategies are used to mentor, develop and appraise staff.</p><p>Further strengthening the appraisal system should include:</p><ul>
<li>evidence that clearly demonstrates how well the Standards for the Teaching Profession are met</li>
<li>targeted, individual teacher inquiry into the impact of their teaching practices on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Regular self review occurs and results in change. Teachers are beginning to shift to a collaborative internal evaluation framework that promotes improvement. As part of this, an increased focus on outcomes for children, and measurement of the impact of actions, is needed.</p><p>Leaders work collaboratively to implement a shared vision. BestStart managers are supportive and there is a focus on improvement. In 2017, this support has been disrupted while a new regional manager and a PSM have been appointed. This process has been completed. They use knowledge of high quality practice to guide and inform change. The organisation's systems and processes provide a useful framework to support sustainability and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that key next steps are for leaders and teachers to develop:</p><ul>
<li>consistent high quality teacher practice for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>individual assessment, planning and evaluation that shows connections to children's culture, language and identity</li>
<li>further understanding of educational success for Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>internal evaluation focused on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Harrison St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice management should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure clear guidance and training is put in place for staff to promote consistent responses to supporting children's social competence.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Harrison St will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>16 November 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
