</table><p>Avenues EduCare¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avenues EduCare is a community based, non-profit centre in Whangarei. The centre is based in an historic building, having been the first childcare centre in Whangarei. It is currently licensed for 40 children, including up to 16 children under two years of age. The centre operates daily from 7 am to 5:30 pm.</p><p>The majority of children attending the centre are of PƒÅkehƒÅ or MƒÅori heritage. The philosophy is based on establishing relationships with children and whƒÅnau. Its aim is for teachers to recognise all children as individuals, and empower them to grow to their full potential.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted positive aspects, including a purposeful vision and good quality interactions between children and teachers. Suggested improvements included programme planning, bicultural practice, and aligning teacher appraisal goals with strategic goals. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The teaching team includes employees who have been at the centre for more than 10 years. The centre provides high teacher-to-child ratios. The manager, team leaders and registered teachers are supported by unqualified teachers, an administrator and a cook. A parent committee manages the governance of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported well to settle at the centre, and to communicate confidently with others. They understand that their ideas are valued, and develop a sense of themselves as capable learners. They freely explore both the inside and outdoor environments.</p><p>Leaders have intentionally created conditions that enable teachers to enact the centre's philosophy. Mutually trusting relationships among children and with teachers are evident. Teachers engage in meaningful conversations with children, supporting their wellbeing. Children have opportunities to participate in tuakana/teina interactions and play cooperatively with each other.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and follow an individualised approach to accommodate the diverse learning needs of children from different backgrounds, and those with additional learning or language needs. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori in the context of play and in documentation.</p><p>The environment at the centre reflects the current interests of children and teachers. Attractive and relevant wall displays and accessible information are available for children, parents and teachers. Children have opportunities to revisit their learning in both the under and over two year old environments.</p><p>Teachers develop trusting relationships with parents. They have established strong connections with families and the professional community. Teachers have a good knowledge and understanding of children's different backgrounds. Parents appreciate the thoughtful management of transitions into and within the centre, and on to school.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are developing a shared understanding about working with the 2017 revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are trialling a new planning approach with the aim to gather better parent and child input into designing the programme. Assessments are regular and some portfolios show children's continuity of learning. It would be worthwhile for teachers to document all children's progress over time.</p><p>Teachers use a relevant framework for internal evaluation. The organisational culture at the centre supports collaboration, and internal evaluation leads to improved outcomes for children. They access relevant professional learning and development to strengthen their teaching practice. Teachers plan to review the philosophy to better align with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The well-developed strategic plan provides direction for centre operations. Aligning the annual planning with this plan, and setting specific indicators or measures, would support leaders and teachers to evaluate their progress in achieving the centre's strategic goals.</p><p>The manager and teachers provide detailed reports on centre operations to the committee. Some policies are being rewritten to ensure that they meet all current requirements and legislation. Health and safety practices related to excursions, sleep recording, medication administration, and emergency drills are being revised to provide better guidance for teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme planning by making visible the teaching role in children's learning, and evaluating the impact of teachers' practice on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing the centre's bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making children's individual cultures more visible in centre documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation to monitor progress against strategic centre goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avenues EduCare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
