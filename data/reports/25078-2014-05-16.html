</table><p>The management and staff at St James KidsWay need to ensure that recent initiatives are fully implemented to help improve the quality of education at the centre.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St James Kidsway is a Christian-based early childhood centre in Pukekohe catering for up to 30 children between 3 and 5 years of age. The centre is owned by the St James Presbyterian Church and operates from a purpose-built facility on spacious grounds.</p><p>A governance group has been established to provide strategic direction and oversight for the centre. This group is in the early stages of developing its role. The head teacher works with four other qualified teachers and reports to a management committee.</p><p>The 2007 and 2011 ERO reports stated that the centre provided a supportive environment that enabled children to make choices about their play, and that it catered well for children with special learning needs. The quality of relationships with parents and the enactment of the Christian ethos were also noted as strengths of the centre. These positive features of centre practice continue to be evident.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report recommended that teachers increase the challenge the programme offered children. This remains a significant priority for the centre to address.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and generally busy. They enjoy the freedom they have to explore the space and the basic activities on offer. Children have formed friendships and play well in groups. Teachers support children to be involved in activities.</p><p>While the tone of the centre is happy and inclusive, the programme provides limited challenge for children. Children are highly capable and would benefit from more complex learning opportunities, some of which should link to their interests and develop over time. There is evidence that rich learning does happen at times, but this is not a consistent part of the curriculum.</p><p>Some useful systems are in place to support staff and managers to review aspects of centre operation. These include policy review and spontaneous review in response to matters that arise. Teachers have also started to undertake ‚Äòbigger picture‚Äô review, which should help them to better gauge the effectiveness of their practices. The recent philosophy review has helped staff to identify the learning they value. This useful step should help staff to measure the extent to which they are meeting their stated aims.</p><p>Teachers have participated in ongoing professional learning and development to improve ways in which they assess children‚Äôs learning. Improvements in assessment are becoming apparent, but are not yet leading to richer experiences for children.</p><p>The new appraisal process has been selected for its potential to encourage teachers to reflect on and inquire into their practice. Engaging in this process should help staff to strengthen their professional knowledge about effective practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Members of the governing board and management committee recognise the need to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify how the roles of the board and management committee intersect and are distinct from each other</li>
<li>receive better quality reports and information that will help them make informed decisions about improvements needed</li>
<li>ask questions that help them to be assured the centre is meeting requirements</li>
<li>establish a strategic plan that helps them focus on the centre‚Äôs future.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The majority of teachers have been at the centre for a long period of time, and the teaching team has struggled with health and energy issues. Collectively, teachers recognise the need to:</p><ul>
<li>provide a more challenging programme for children that involves complex and ongoing learning</li>
<li>enrich the curriculum by making greater links with the community</li>
<li>share more formal information about children‚Äôs learning with families</li>
<li>find out about and be more responsive to children‚Äôs home cultures and languages</li>
<li>strengthen bicultural provision and the visibility of MƒÅori culture in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>In order to achieve these shifts, teachers need to change and update some of their practices, and the quality of curriculum leadership needs to be strengthened. Ongoing external support would be beneficial. The management committee and governance group can have higher expectations of their staff and should seek assurance from them, through robust self review, that progress is being made.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St James KidsWay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St James KidsWay will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>16 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
