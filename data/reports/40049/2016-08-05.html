</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotorua Community Crƒìche &amp; Kindergarten Inc. provides a mixed-age service that caters for children from birth to school age. The centre philosophy is based on the concepts whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and kotahitanga (relationships, nurture and wellbeing). Children are to become 'curious, competent and confident learners, who have a lifelong love of learning' involved in an inclusive curriculum that is child initiated and promotes a sense of holistic development.</p><p>Rotorua Community Crƒìche &amp; Kindergarten Inc. is well established in the community and has a positive ERO reporting history. The centre has a full licence for 38 children including 8 children up to the age of two. There are four fully qualified ECE teachers and two other teachers who have undertaken aspects of early childhood training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents and children are warmly welcomed each day and are well informed about centre values and their child‚Äôs health and wellbeing. The centre philosophy reflects the aspirations of all staff, parents and whƒÅnau. The centre manager and centre supervisor have set high expectations for teaching practice. Together with a strong team of teachers they are clearly focused on children's wellbeing and learning through play. These high expectations are well communicated to parents and whƒÅnau in order to promote high quality educational outcomes for children.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and young children, parents, whƒÅnau and teachers demonstrate high levels of enjoyment, belonging and wellbeing in the centre. The mixed-age nature of the centre provides many opportunities for children of all ages to make choices, and explore their interests alongside highly supportive teachers. Teachers acknowledge the importance of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau as tangata whenua. They model culturally responsive practices. The cultures of all children are valued as parents share their knowledge with teachers when children come into the centre. All children enjoy responsive care from teachers and other adults who know them well.</p><p>Children over two years demonstrate high levels of social skills when they interact with younger siblings and other children in their play. They are able to express their ideas, opinions and creativity through complex play and projects over time. Teachers are skilled at recognising and responding to children's strengths and interests. Adults show respect and care in their interactions with children and sensitivity towards their emerging interests. Planned sessions to meet children's learning needs include trips and excursions into the wider community.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well integrated into the programme. The natural contribution babies and toddlers make to relationships in the centre is significant. Their responsiveness to their brothers and sisters, as well as other children and teachers, is reciprocal and mutually beneficial for all. These crucial and early relationships promote trusting and respectful behaviours among babies, toddlers and children. Teachers are well informed by parents and carefully monitor babies and toddlers to ensure that their specific needs are met and home routines are followed as much as possible.</p><p>The programme of learning through play acknowledges the strengths of all children. It provides a purposeful and meaningful framework for the integration of literacy, mathematics and te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Children have a strong sense of belonging and confidently engage in play activities that extend their learning.</p><p>A collaborative process of self review is a feature of centre development. A recent review of how te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is implemented and integrated into the centre programme involved, gathering, collating and analysing information from parents/whƒÅnau and staff. The learning outcomes from this review has resulted in an increased understanding of reo and tikanga MƒÅori, and an improvement in the centre's progress towards building a bicultural learning environment.</p><p>Teachers share their observations and knowledge openly, and together plan strategies to effectively extend children‚Äôs interests. This reflective approach is contributing to the consistency of teaching in the centre and promotes children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Leaders have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and what they bring to their learning. Collaborated ways of working are fostered with all staff, and roles and responsibilities are shared. Regular policy review and improvements to the monitoring and evaluation of the way children learn, and how adults plan in the centre contribute to centre progress and improvements. It is important for the centre to continue to review how they record the way children learn.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The following aspects for further development and review include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strengthening of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and sharing cultural experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building whƒÅnau voice in portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to review how teachers record the way children learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending opportunities and catering for the interest of boys.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rotorua Community Creche &amp; Kindergarten Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rotorua Community Creche &amp; Kindergarten Inc. will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
