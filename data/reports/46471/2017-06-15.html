</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Back2Nature Childcare is a newly established home-based education and care service in Whangarei, with educators in urban and rural areas. The service's philosophy aligns children's learning with the natural world and a focus on outdoor programmes.</p><p>The service currently has one standard network of 12 educators, and is working towards establishing a quality funded network. There are presently 31 children enrolled, including 11 aged under two years. Half the children have Māori heritage.</p><p>The service is led by the owner and two part-time mentoring teachers who are fully registered. They provide support and guidance for the educators and the mentoring teachers assist the owner in managing the service. This leadership team participates in a significant amount of professional development and has a strong commitment to building educators' use of te reo Māori.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Their learning records show that they participate in a wide variety of experiences. Educators provide many creative, physical and social activities in homes, outdoors and in the community. Programmes include opportunities for early literacy and numeracy learning and support for language development. Educators’ incidental use of te reo Māori and waiata, and the service’s involvement in a kapa haka initiative, are some of the ways Māori children are supported to be successful as Māori.</p><p>The service features a group nature excursion each week attended by all educators and children. These excursions are often linked to children's interests and enable them to enjoy a variety of parks, beaches and woodland areas in and around Whangarei. They also become familiar with all the educators and develop tuakana/teina relationships with the other children.</p><p>Mentoring teachers support children and their families' well, as they settle with educators. They visit educators frequently to monitor children's progress, with a particular focus on infants and toddlers and children with special needs. Teachers help educators to identify children's interests, and to capture their significant experiences in learning stories and photos. They write affirming reports to guide educators' work with children and encourage programme planning that will promote learning. Educators have yet to develop formal supervision plans.</p><p>Educators maintain strong relationships with whānau. In addition to daily informal conversations, they share learning stories and other information via social media, and document care routines each day. The leadership team has identified the need to strengthen its partnership with parents to involve them more in the service and aspects of their children’s learning.</p><p>Training and professional development has had a positive impact on the teachers and educators and on outcomes for children. Several educators have had relevant training in early childhood teaching or health care. They also benefit from in-service courses, first-aid training and ongoing guidance to extend their knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori. They participate in an appraisal process to continue their development.</p><p>The leaders are engaged in ongoing professional development to enhance leadership skills and extend their understanding of tuakana/teina relationships. Appraisal processes at this level are not yet underway.</p><p>The owner and mentoring teachers have made good progress in developing the service. They have established a clear vision, strategic goals and an annual plan to guide practices. The team engages in meaningful internal evaluation that includes regular policy review as well as strategies to address spontaneous issues and long-term improvement projects. Ongoing informal reflection between the leaders has resulted in distributed leadership roles, high trust levels and a willingness to critique and improve practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and mentoring teachers agree that the key next steps for enhancing the service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing links between their strategic goals and annual planning, to provide clear guidelines for achieving the goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening partnerships between parents and the service leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve programme planning and evaluation for educators’ in-home programmes and for the weekly group excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Back2Nature Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.</em> In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Back2Nature Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>15 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
