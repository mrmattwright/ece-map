<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Pukerua Bay Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Pukerua Bay Kindergarten is an integral part of a small, close knit, well established community which is highly supportive of the centre. Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are well-managed, and staff maintain links with families across generations.</p><p>The programme has a strong emphasis on building children&rsquo;s confidence and ensuring that, as the philosophy states, &ldquo;children find out who they are and to believe in themselves&rdquo;. Children&rsquo;s interests and preferences guide programme development. There is an emphasis on literacy and children use the print rich learning environment to support their development. Information and communication technologies (ICT) add further options for children&rsquo;s learning in this area.</p><p>Wall displays make the programme planning process transparent for parents and visitors. As part of a collaborative approach, teachers encourage contributions from parents and input from children. A bicultural perspective is evident.</p><p>Individual and small group play is a feature. Children work collaboratively to explore their environment, make discoveries, follow their interests and play with their friends. They are confident and articulate and approach adults for assistance, additional resources and conversation.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments provide resources that children use in open-ended, challenging and creative play. Teachers respond well to children&rsquo;s initiative and creativity and work to support and extend these aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and exploration.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. Feedback from parents and families is sought and valued by staff. The kindergarten has a close relationship with the local school. Transition is planned and well managed.</p><p>There have been significant staffing changes since the May 2008 ERO report, which has led to the current focus on building a strong teaching team with a shared philosophical understanding.</p><p>Staff continue to develop an appreciation of evaluation and self review to better gauge the effectiveness of their teaching strategies and the impact of the programme on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Pukerua Bay Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Pukerua Bay Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>
<p>the interactions between children and adults.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>Since the previous ERO report there have been several staffing changes. The teaching team has developed a new team contract to bring a shared and cohesive approach and understanding to their work with young children.</p><p>Use of ICT was noted as a particular strength of the programme in the previous ERO report and this continues to be so. Children have good access to ICT resources that particularly supports their literacy development.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>Programme</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to have input and assist with decision making about the programme. Children&rsquo;s preferences and contributions are valued and form the basis of planning, with a strong emphasis on helping children to build relationships and develop a sense of belonging. Programme planning is clear and well documented. Children and their families have access to the complete programme planning process through a clear and purposeful wall display.</p><p>Children participate in sustained individual and group play. Established routines provide a stable and flexible framework for the day. Teachers encourage children to act as role models for each other, and support them in large group situations to demonstrate their learning to others. This practice supports children&rsquo;s growing confidence and leadership capability.</p><p>There is an emphasis on literacy learning throughout the programme. This is supported through specific teaching strategies, access to a wide range of resources including ICT and informative wall displays which make aspects of literacy explicit for both children and parents. Early literacy learning is encouraged in all areas of the kindergarten both inside and outdoors. Children respond well to this initiative.</p><p>Natural science is an integral part of the programme, and is visible in the indoor and outdoor environments. Children are encouraged to learn about and extend their knowledge of the natural world including planting and looking after the gardens.</p><p>A bicultural approach to learning continues to form an important part of the programme. Regular opportunities for children to learn about te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are provided by the head teacher and a part time teacher of te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning stories contain a range of perspectives from teachers which has increased the depth and complexity of their recognition of, and response to, children&rsquo;s learning. Group learning stories identify individual children and connect their learning and behaviour to the group. Teachers have developed a variety of ways to engage with parents and capture parent voice within children&rsquo;s learning stories. Portfolios are accessible and revisited by children and parents.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and engage in robust professional discussion. They frequently consider their own practice to gauge children&rsquo;s learning and progress.</p><p>Interactions</p><p>Children play collaboratively and cooperatively in small groups for significant periods of time. Respectful and supportive relationships are evident among teachers and children, and between adults. Teachers foster open communication with parents and families. Their input into the programme and children&rsquo;s portfolios is valued.</p><p>Children are secure and confident to take risks with their learning. Teachers use critical questioning, new ideas, and complex language to challenge and extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Teachers affirm and value children&rsquo;s contributions.</p><p>Environment</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments provide resources that children can use in open-ended and creative play. Teachers respond well to children&rsquo;s creativity and initiative and work to extend these through critical questioning and additional resourcing, particularly in the visual and expressive arts.</p><p>The outdoor environment provides a wide variety of opportunities for appropriate physical challenge, including enclosed and open spaces and different levels of terrain. Resources are freely accessible to children and encourage cooperative play. The indoor environment is well maintained throughout the day.</p><p>M&#257;ori arts are visible in wall displays and through music. Te reo M&#257;oriis nurtured in conversation with children. The development for children and teachers in te reo M&#257;ori is supported through displays of instructions, signs and symbols.</p><h4><em>Area for development and review</em></h4><p>Teachers are continuing to develop their understanding of evaluation to further improve outcomes for children. ERO concurs with this direction.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through <em>Te&nbsp;Manawa</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Pukerua Bay Kindergarten completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>

</table><p>5 September 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-pukerua-bay-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Pukerua Bay Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Pukerua Bay Kindergarten.</p><p>Pukerua Bay Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Pukerua Bay Kindergarten is an integral part of a small, close knit, well established community which is highly supportive of the centre. Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are well-managed, and staff maintain links with families across generations.</p><p>The programme has a strong emphasis on building children&rsquo;s confidence and ensuring that, as the philosophy states, &ldquo;children find out who they are and to believe in themselves&rdquo;. Children&rsquo;s interests and preferences guide programme development. There is an emphasis on literacy and children use the print rich learning environment to support their development. Information and communication technologies (ICT) add further options for children&rsquo;s learning in this area.</p><p>Wall displays make the programme planning process transparent for parents and visitors. As part of a collaborative approach, teachers encourage contributions from parents and input from children. A bicultural perspective is evident.</p><p>Individual and small group play is a feature. Children work collaboratively to explore their environment, make discoveries, follow their interests and play with their friends. They are confident and articulate and approach adults for assistance, additional resources and conversation.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments provide resources that children use in open-ended, challenging and creative play. Teachers respond well to children&rsquo;s initiative and creativity and work to support and extend these aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and exploration.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. Feedback from parents and families is sought and valued by staff. The kindergarten has a close relationship with the local school. Transition is planned and well managed.</p><p>There have been significant staffing changes since the May 2008 ERO report, which has led to the current focus on building a strong teaching team with a shared philosophical understanding.</p><p>Staff continue to develop an appreciation of evaluation and self review to better gauge the effectiveness of their teaching strategies and the impact of the programme on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
