</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tutira Early Childhood Centre is situated in a rural community of Tutira, 40 kilometres north of Napier. It operates from the community hall six hours a day, three days per week. Education and care are provided for up to 30 children, including five up to the age of two years. Of the 17 children enrolled, five identify as MƒÅori. At the time of this review, no children under two years of age attended this service.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board of trustees. A senior teacher, who began her role in January 2015, has oversight of the curriculum and teaching team. The centre has undergone some staff changes and the current team was established in Term 3, 2016.</p><p>Trustees, leaders and teachers have made significant progress in addressing the areas for development identified in the August 2014 ERO report. The centre has had targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). As a result, the service developed an action plan that has resulted in improved centre practices and outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a play-based curriculum reflective of their rural context. The guiding philosophy, highly evident in practice, is based on fostering a sense of belonging and identity for children and their families. Teachers successfully follow the interests and support the needs of children.</p><p>Children and their parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed. Teachers know children and their whƒÅnau well and make meaningful links between the centre programme and the child‚Äôs home. The centre is a valuable point of contact for families in this rural community. Parents contribute to the programme and participate in a range of centre activities.</p><p>Children learn and play in a calm, unhurried and nurturing environment. There is a focus on natural resources to promote curiosity and inquiry. Teachers work alongside children supporting them to be independent, to problem solve and to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios are a rich record of their time at the centre. Learning stories show children's participation in the curriculum and their learning over time. The gathering of and response to parent aspirations has been strengthened. Literacy and numeracy are promoted and local excursions provide a useful extension to the programme.</p><p>Children's language, culture and identity are valued. Since the June 2014 ERO report, there has been an ongoing focus to further develop the bicultural curriculum and educational success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori. Teachers have participated in professional learning and development (PLD) looking at <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> and <em>Te Whatu P≈çkeka: Kaupapa Assessment for Learning MƒÅori,</em> to support these developments. The centre has identified the need to continue to strengthen this and teachers' cultural competency to better support MƒÅori success. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Ongoing review and development of the centre's transition-to-school processes have resulted in strengthened practices. Teachers have developed a relationship with the local school. Children are able to participate in school events and activities. Successful transitions into and out of the centre are well supported. Teachers respond to the individual needs of children and their families.</p><p>The senior teacher effectively manages day-to-day operation. She works with the teaching team to build leadership capability. Teachers work collaboratively and regularly reflect on their practice to improve ongoing support for children. There is a well-developed appraisal process to promote professional growth. Extensive PLD has supported the recent centre developments.</p><p>Recent self review has been appropriately focused on developing and improving centre policies and operation. Trustees, leaders, and teachers are now well-placed to develop internal evaluation processes to monitor the effectiveness of centre operation and practice and guide future decision making.</p><p>Trustees have been highly responsive in addressing the recommendations outlined in the previous ERO report. They have engaged in ongoing learning to build their knowledge and understanding of their governance roles and responsibilities. Appropriate policies and procedures are in place to support and guide centre operation and to ensure they are well placed to sustain improvements. Trustees are currently in the process of developing a strategic and annual plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Trustees, senior teacher, teachers and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Tutira Early Childhood Centre. Staff should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the bicultural curriculum, teachers' knowledge and understanding of MƒÅori success and culturally responsive practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tutira Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tutira Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>4 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
