</table><p>4 Kids &amp; Whanau Centre¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>4 Kids &amp; Whanau Centre needs to develop its curriculum systems and improve aspects of governance, and health and safety practices to meet licensing requirements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The 4 Kids &amp; Whanau Centre is a well-established early learning service. It is governed by the Glenfield Action Trust, which is part of the Baptist Church Community. The children enrolled are from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre's philosophy upholds Christian values, views all children as capable and competent learners, and emphasises the importance of children's identity and culture. Children are in two age-related rooms with separate outdoor areas. Infants and toddlers are in the <span lang="mi">Pipi</span> Room and older children are in the <span lang="mi">PƒÅua</span> Room.</p><p>A centre director, who is a member of the Trust, has overall responsibility for centre operations. There are five qualified teachers, including a centre manager. There are also 13 teachers' assistants.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified strengths including teachers' respectful interactions with children and positive relationships with parents/whƒÅnau. These strengths have been maintained. ERO's report noted that teacher appraisal systems should be improved. This remains an area of development for the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for in a warm and positive environment. Staff are attentive to and recognise children's physical and emotional needs. They encourage children to independently investigate the indoor and outdoor environments. Infants and toddlers have access to a good range of resources, activities and play opportunities.</p><p>Staff could now plan a curriculum that is responsive to the interests and strengths of infants and toddlers, with a greater focus on learning outcomes. They should build shared staff understandings of more intentional teaching practices that can best support the learning of younger children.</p><p>Older children demonstrate positive and constructive relationships with each other. They confidently explore the resources and activities that teachers set up for them. Children have good opportunities to engage in focused play for long periods of time.</p><p>Staff work alongside children well. They ask open-ended questions, respond to children's ideas, and build on their suggestions. Their teaching approach prompts children's curiosity and extends their learning. Staff could now increase the extent to which they help children to plan for and lead their own learning.</p><p>Managers and staff maintain strong relationships with parents, whƒÅnau and the wider community. Aspects of children's diverse cultures and home languages are evident in the curriculum and the environment. Parents are well informed about their children's participation in the programme through an online communication platform.</p><p>The teacher appraisal process requires improvement to meet Teaching Council requirements. This includes the appraiser documenting an annual summary that is linked to the Teaching Standards, for each qualified teacher. Internal evaluation systems could be strengthened. Staff could focus on how well evaluation findings inform their decision making and contribute to improved teaching practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing shared staff understandings about <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, to support individualised learning for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving curriculum planning and evaluation records to show the impact of the curriculum and teaching practices on outcomes for children¬†¬†</p>
</li>
<li>improving internal evaluation systems by identifying the impact of improvements on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Managers need to ensure that aspects of the licensing requirements relating to governance and health and safety are monitored and implemented.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of 4 Kids &amp; Whanau Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite visit the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed police vetting requirements (GMA7A).</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety, and governance and management. To meet requirements the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>records of excursions include assessment and management of risk, adult:child ratios and evidence of parental permission and approval of adult:child ratios for special excursions</li>
<li>the service's child protection policy and procedures are consistently implemented</li>
<li>job/role descriptions are developed for all employed and volunteer staff</li>
<li>safety checks are undertaken, and results obtained before a new worker has access to children.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> HS17, HS31, GMA7, GMA7A.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>27 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
