</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre in Ellerslie Village, operates in two adjacent residential villas that have been thoughtfully adapted to cater for young children. The service provides for up to 46 children, with infants and toddlers in one villa and older children in the preschool villa.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2013 review, a modern addition to the preschool villa has been completed and other improvements have been made. The outdoor areas at the rear of the villas provide expansive grass areas and natural shade under well-established trees.</p><p>The owner works closely with the centre manager and the two head teachers. The teaching teams include eight registered teachers, and many staff are longstanding team members. Centre operations are underpinned by a guiding vision and values. There is a strong focus on respectful, trusting relationships with children and their whƒÅnau, and on promoting children‚Äôs belonging and wellbeing. Programmes for children are guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, as well as aspects of Pikler and Reggio Emilia approaches and philosophies.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2013 report identified many positive features. In particular it noted effective management and collaborative leadership. ERO recommended improving planning and assessment, self-review, staff appraisal and strategic planning. Good progress has been made in these areas. ERO also recommended that the centre‚Äôs philosophy statement include a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents are warmly welcomed and children settle quickly into play activities of their own choice. Children‚Äôs belonging and wellbeing are very well supported in the inviting, home-like environment. Teachers give careful attention to children‚Äôs care and are very purposeful in the way they support children‚Äôs developing independence.</p><p>The strong focus on developing children‚Äôs sense of belonging and promoting their wellbeing is the foundation for high quality provision for infants and toddlers. There is a calm, unhurried and inclusive tone in this villa. Teachers‚Äô philosophy relating to infants‚Äô care and education is well understood and clearly evident in practice. Children establish close bonds with their teachers and are well supported to develop at their own pace. Children are encouraged to explore freely, particularly in the outdoors.</p><p>Teachers are very effectively encouraging infants' and toddlers‚Äô oral language development. They engage these younger children in meaningful conversations and frequently share and enjoy books with them in various spaces around the centre. Children‚Äôs individual journals contain very good information about each child‚Äôs care and learning and reflect a sense of partnership with parents. Teachers use research about best practice in infant and toddler programmes to continually improve their practice.</p><p>A highlight of the preschool programme is teachers‚Äô and children‚Äôs obvious enjoyment as they engage with each other in play. Children work together cooperatively and communicate with adults confidently. Teachers foster children‚Äôs creativity and imagination. Children participate in story-telling in ways that support their literacy learning and promote a love of learning. Teachers could now review the balance between teacher-directed and child-led learning and the extent to which they support depth and complexity in children‚Äôs learning over time.</p><p>Teachers have recently participated in professional development that has helped them to become more confident about using te reo MƒÅori words and phrases in their interactions with children. Some staff and whƒÅnau have begun to take a leadership role in this area. WhƒÅnau express their appreciation of this bicultural development. Teachers‚Äô improved understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and their commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and bicultural practices are apparent in a variety of centre documents and practices.</p><p>The centre environments are carefully designed and resourced to support teaching and learning. Indoor spaces are attractively presented and furnished. Children have ready access to outdoor areas that offer a variety of physical challenges as well as areas for creative and imaginative play. The natural environment and materials are important and valuable aspects of children‚Äôs learning experiences at the centre.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitions from one part of the centre to another are well managed. This is in large part because there are good connections between the two villas and children are familiar with all teaching staff. Managers provide good information for parents about the transition process. They have also developed useful processes for supporting children and families as they prepare to make the transition to school.</p><p>Teachers continue to work with an external adviser to strengthen their assessment and programme planning practices. Individual children‚Äôs portfolios contain well analysed learning stories that show teachers‚Äô knowledge of each child.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes collaboratively. They regularly reflect on learning outcomes for children and use this information to plan programmes around specific focus areas. Teachers use a variety of strategies to share information with parents about the programme and about children's learning.</p><p>The owner and manager work well together and support teachers to take leadership roles and develop leadership skills. Teachers value the owner‚Äôs active, ongoing support for their individual and collective professional development and her pastoral care.</p><p>The owner has expanded her strategic planning processes. As a result, there is now a greater shared understanding about the centre‚Äôs future direction and next steps. Staff are currently in the process of reviewing their philosophical approaches and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and manager recognise that they could now increase the rigour of internal evaluation by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using indicators of best practice in early childhood education as a basis for deepening their evaluation of centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering ways to include children‚Äôs ideas and perspectives in their self-review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be worthwhile to explore options for ensuring that teachers have appropriate undisturbed time to complete documentation and to reflect on their teaching practice. Teaching teams could strengthen their practices by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>considering ways to increase the complexity in collaborative child-directed learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more purposefully planning strategies for fostering children‚Äôs thinking and independent problem solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more specifically connecting assessment and programme plans for each child to their family's cultural knowledge and identity, home languages, and their place in the context of whƒÅnau and community.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the owner and manager are aware of the need to align relevant policies and procedures with the Vulnerable Children Act 2014 and new Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
