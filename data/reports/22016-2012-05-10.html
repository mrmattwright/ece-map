<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Freemans Bay Playcentre is a parent cooperative that operates as part of the Auckland Playcentres Association. The Association provides on-going support and training programmes for centre members.</p>
<p>Freemans Bay Playcentre has recently been involved in a redevelopment phase, with several new families joining. The cultural make-up of the centre is less diverse than at the time of the 2009 ERO review.</p>
<p>The programme enables children to explore and experiment. Members cater well for all children&rsquo;s ages and stages of development with a programme based around children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Centre members work closely with children to support their play. Children play cooperatively with other children, enjoying activities and frequent conversations.</p>
<p>A significant number of members are working towards association expectations to achieve Course 1. Several of the more experienced members who hold higher course levels will leave the centre this year as their children graduate to school. Newer members receive good quality support and modelling from those with more Playcentre Course levels.</p>
<p>The outdoor area provides good opportunities for children to explore and engage in physical activities. Centre members use the indoor playroom to create attractive playing spaces that entice children&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Centre members help children to understand aspects of the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand. Children respond positively to M&#257;ori words and phrases and sing waiata.</p>
<p>Centre members are aware of the need to continue building skills in documenting children&rsquo;s play and dispositions. Members plan to increase the focus on self review of the programme, and ways of strengthening their biculturalism.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the members of Freemans Bay Playcentre were invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Freemans Bay Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>At the time of the 2008 ERO review, the centre was rebuilding member numbers. Members had moved back into their centre after remodelling of the outdoor space by the City Council. Families represented diverse cultures and supported each other through friendly relationships and effective teamwork. Children received an interesting and absorbing programme of activities and experiences.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><em>Well-being and belonging.</em> Centre members and their children demonstrate a sense of belonging, community and ownership in the centre. Teamwork is evident in the excellent levels of supervision members provide and in their close work with children. Children are settled and confident with adults. The friendly and inclusive tone in the centre supports the well-being of centre members and their children.</p>
<p><em>Interactions.</em> Children are confident communicators. Some members support children&rsquo;s conversations well by using open-ended questions to prompt children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills. All members engage children in conversations as they work with them. Children talk eagerly together. Close friendships and tuakana-teina relationships are well developed between children.</p>
<p><em>Varied programme.</em> The centre is well-equipped with good quality resources and materials stored so that children are able to access them. Centre members provide a changing range of interesting activities and experiences. Children competently use resources and activities in ways to suit their immediate interests. Centre members include aspects of literacy and numeracy as part of play.</p>
<p><em>Recognition of cultures.</em> The Auckland Playcentres Association has a strong focus on helping members provide a bicultural component in programmes. Centre members include words in te reo M&#257;ori in conversations with children and sing waiata with them. Biculturalism is also represented in centre displays. Japanese children speak confidently in their home language as well as in English and have shared some songs in Japanese.</p>
<p><em>Programme planning.</em> Members meet regularly to discuss the programme. Session evaluation, when members share children&rsquo;s interests, helps to guide the presentation of activities on subsequent days. Members display information about their child&rsquo;s development and dispositions to further assist with planning.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p><em>Assessment and planning.</em> The Auckland Playcentres Association has identified the need to work with all centres on assessment processes that demonstrate the connection between what parents know of children&rsquo;s interests and programme planning. The Association will also support members to document children&rsquo;s development over time. Members of Freemans Bay Playcentre will benefit from this professional development.</p>
<p><em>Further development.</em> ERO and centre members identified areas for development and review. Members could continue to use self-review processes to:</p>
<ul><li>strengthen the use of Te Wh&#257;riki as part of evaluation of the programme</li>
<li>ensure that science experiments and activities include scientific explanations for children</li>
<li>increase the focus on biculturalism.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Freemans Bay Playcentre completed an ERO <em>Centre Management Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

<p>The outdoor area provides good opportunities for children to explore and engage in physical activities. Centre members use the indoor playroom to create attractive playing spaces that entice children&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Centre members help children to understand aspects of the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand. Children respond positively to M&#257;ori words and phrases and sing waiata.</p>
<p>Centre members are aware of the need to continue building skills in documenting children&rsquo;s play and dispositions. Members plan to increase the focus on self review of the programme, and ways of strengthening their biculturalism.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
