</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cornerstone Christian Preschool is a community-based, Christian early learning service located in Palmerston North. It provides an all-day service five days per week and is licensed for 40 children aged over two years. Of the 36 children enrolled, a small number are MƒÅori. Some children attending the centre have additional learning needs. The centre serves a diverse ethnic community.</p><p>The service is governed by Cornerstone Christian Education Trust (CCET). A committee made up of staff, parents, whƒÅnau and CCET representatives manages operation. Responsibility for the education programme is undertaken by the supervisor.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises the importance of Christian values and strong partnerships with family/whƒÅnau. It acknowledges the Treaty of Waitangi, and individual heritage of all akonga.</p><p>The October 2015 ERO report, confirmed teachers‚Äô identified priorities for development: improving the performance management process; and strengthening distributed leadership. In addition teachers needed to show increasing complexity of children‚Äôs learning in assessment documentation. Significant progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A high quality environment effectively supports the learning programme. Close and trusting relationships are evident. An extensive range of resources promotes children's interest and participation. The outdoor area is well developed to support physically active play. Regular excursions into the local community and a variety of visitors add richness to the programme. Children have choices about what they do and who with. They are cooperative, engaged and empowered learners.</p><p>Teachers are responsive and respectful as they work with and alongside children. They use a range of effective, researched strategies to support their learning and persistence in play. There is a strong focus on encouraging communication, curiosity and deeper thinking. High expectations and consistent teacher practice support children's social competence.</p><p>Those requiring additional learning support are encouraged and enabled to be active participants in the programme. Teachers have the knowledge and skills to successfully encourage children's involvement, communication and social learning.</p><p>High levels of family participation and a strong sense of community are evident. Parents are well informed about their children's learning and progress. Many willingly share their cultures, languages and aspirations to support the programme. Partnerships in learning are developing.</p><p>A bicultural perspective is evident in the programme. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are valued. Leaders agree they should continue to strengthen their approach by seeking suitable resources and information and iwi connections.</p><p>Children's transitions are carefully planned. Those new to the service are settled in with their parents' support and collaboration. The 'Eager Beavers' group for older children specifically focuses on building their leadership and skills in making wise choices, in readiness for school. A well-established relationship with the school sharing the site includes regular reciprocal visits that support familiarity and social interaction between older and younger children.</p><p>The curriculum is largely based on children's choices, interests and ideas that are regularly noted by teachers. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are carefully integrated in play-based ways. Teachers have recently worked together to implement the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, and identify valued learning outcomes as a basis for programme development. They are aware that a next step is to further define these outcomes to enable them to measure the impact of the planned programme on children's learning and support ongoing planning decisions.</p><p>Stories are regularly written about individuals and the group that outline aspects of children's participation, learning and progress. To further improve the quality of planning for learning, teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure children' cultures, a bicultural perspective, and parents' aspirations for their children's learning are more visible in their approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the focus on children's significant learning and interests, and strategies to progress these over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>High levels of commitment to the philosophy, and a professional and collaborative approach promote cohesive teamwork. Strong leadership for teacher development and improved outcomes for children is evident. The appraisal process is well implemented to build the quality of professional practice. Carefully considered teacher professional development opportunities have had a significant impact on the quality of teaching and leadership. There is a well organised approach to managing operation.</p><p>An appropriate framework is in place to support internal evaluation. Understanding and use of the process is well developed. Reference to research, educational publications and examples of best practice supports good decisions about change and improvement. Revised centre guidelines should promote the sustainability of the team's agreed approach over time.</p><p>Governance is effective. The management committee is well informed about teaching, learning and day-to-day management through the supervisor's comprehensive reporting. Progress in meeting long-term priorities is regularly tracked. A good range of up-to-date guidelines supports operation. There is a communication channel between the committee and the CCET and more formalised reporting should be considered.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management representatives agree that teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>the bicultural perspective in the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cornerstone Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cornerstone Christian Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>7 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
