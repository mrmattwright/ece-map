</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maru Montessori Pre-School is licenced to provide education and care for up to 45 children between the ages of two and six years. Children can attend for two or more days a week between the hours of 8:45am and 3:15pm.</p><p>Most of the children enrolled are NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ and there are also children from Asian and other European cultures attending. It is a multicultural staff and many speak additional languages as well as English. All six teachers are qualified. Most are experienced teachers and some are long serving in the centre.</p><p>Maru Montessori Preschool follows the principles and practices of the Montessori philosophy, as well as those outlined in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The Montessori philosophy advocates the holistic development of each child through a specially prepared environment. The teacher‚Äôs role includes providing appropriate and timely challenges for each child.</p><p>Children of all ages work and play together most of the day. They choose how they spend their time and move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. Children spend a lot of their time working with Montessori materials. These are organised into the following categories; Practical life, Sensorial equipment, Number works and Language and the Cultural subjects, which include Science, Geography, History, Art and Music.</p><p>The manager works closely with the team leader to ensure that the centre is well governed and managed. He visits several times a week and has regular communication with the team leader. Together, they encourage all teachers to take an active interest in the running of the centre and to grow their leadership skills.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report commented positively on many aspects of the quality of education at the pre-school. Good progress has been made in the areas identified for review and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Maru Montessori Pre-school continues to provide children with many opportunities to learn in a supportive environment. Children enjoy learning as they explore the materials. Teachers observe children and support them to learn in the Montessori areas in which they show interest.</p><p>Children have easy access to resources in a spacious and well organised environment. They take an interest in and look after the equipment and the animals, fruit trees and gardens. Children enjoy the physical challenges provided by the outdoor equipment.</p><p>Teachers treat children as capable and competent learners and allow them to make choices about how they spend their time. Children are given responsibilities as helpers and older children are encouraged to support younger children.</p><p>The pre-school successfully supports children to develop social skills. Teachers‚Äô positive ways of relating to others are reflected in the relationships that children have with each other and the staff.</p><p>Assessment is successfully used to plan children‚Äôs individual learning programmes. Teachers take detailed notes about how children spend their time and their learning progress. Teachers use this assessment to guide children to the next task in the area of the Montessori curriculum.</p><p>Staff use self review successfully to support ongoing improvement. A well established process is followed to guide planned self review. Policies are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain current and that staff are familiar with them. Staff carry out reviews spontaneously when questions arise about processes and practices.</p><p>The preschool has reviewed the extent to which MƒÅori culture and language is integrated into the curriculum. Children and teachers are being well supported to develop their competence and confidence in using te reo MƒÅori and to understand aspects of MƒÅori culture. The diverse cultures of the children are acknowledged through celebrating special cultural events and sharing food.</p><p>Teachers and managers are reviewing how they communicate with parents/whƒÅnau. This review has led to greater use of technology to communicate. Parents are able to meet with teachers at the beginning of each day. New parents are invited to discuss the preschool‚Äôs approach to education and care.</p><p>Managers support teachers to grow professionally. The performance management system has been reviewed and has been strengthened to better support teachers‚Äô professional growth. Teachers have opportunities to reflect on their teaching, to receive feedback from their colleagues and managers, and to take part in professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agreed that they could:</p><ul>
<li>identify further ways to cater for children‚Äôs interests within the programme</li>
<li>review routines related to group times and meal times to maximize learning opportunities</li>
<li>review the strategic plan to ensure that it reflects the thinking that is guiding the centre‚Äôs ongoing improvement and commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maru Montessori Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maru Montessori Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
