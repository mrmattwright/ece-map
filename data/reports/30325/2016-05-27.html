</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children in Kids to Five Maui St centre have a strong sense of belonging in a settled learning environment. They enjoy learning through play and build positive relationships with each other and their teachers. Parents and children are warmly welcomed into the centre, teachers talk with parents/whƒÅnau to ensure their children's needs are met.</p><p>Kids to Five Maui St is owned and operated by BestStart Educare. The centre is located in the northern Hamilton suburb of Te Rapa and caters for children from three months to school age. The centre is a purpose built facility that is designed to meet the needs of all children.</p><p>BestStart philosophy and vision is focused on 'Working in partnership with parents/whƒÅnau to make a positive difference in the life of children'. The values of 'commitment, respect, enthusiasm, diversity, trust and integrity' underpin the culture of the centre. BestStart Educare provides clear policy, guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management.</p><p>A wide range of national and local professional learning and development opportunities are available for all staff. The centre is supported by an area manager, who works collaboratively with the centre manager and teachers to enhance centre leadership and teacher capability.</p><p>Kids to Five on Maui St has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have many opportunities to explore resources in a meaningful and purposeful environment. Their learning preferences, interests, needs and abilities are noticed, recognised and responded to by teachers. Both individual and group learning opportunities contribute to children's learning and social development. Children experience a range of literacy, mathematics and science activities in a well-integrated learning programme. They are encouraged by teachers to build on their prior knowledge and extend their skills.</p><p>Babies are well catered for in the nursery area. They have well-embedded routines that reflect their home environment. There is a designated area for very young babies who are cared for by primary caregivers. Teachers nurture babies wellbeing, encourage language development and effectively respond to their needs. Frequent conversations with parents about how babies move into the Tweenie (toddler) area provide teachers with vital information on how they can support babies in the transition process.</p><p>Toddlers are highly engaged in an environment that provides activities that stimulate and challenge them. They have easy access to both inside and outside resources. Toddlers are free to safely use equipment. This extends and supports their understandings, about the world around them. Teachers model new language for toddlers and give them time to respond. They recognise toddlers‚Äô readiness to move into the Kindy area and smoothly facilitate this process.</p><p>Young children in the Kindy area are engaged in an environment that provides a range of resources, which stimulates their interests. They explore and experiment with equipment, use language and enjoy many opportunities to interact with each other and their teachers. Children have easy access to both inside and outside areas. They have opportunities to lead their own learning, develop friendships and choose when to move into different areas of play. Parents are well informed and are supported as their children transition to primary school or their next stage of learning.</p><p>Teachers have a very good understanding of children‚Äôs developmental needs and deliberately plan to build and extend their emotional, physical and intellectual growth. They work alongside children and encourage them to explore different ways of learning.</p><p>Term evaluation reports based on learning stories recognise the way children learn. These stories are shared with parents in children‚Äôs 'Story Park' a web-based portfolio. Most parents are well informed about their child's progress through their 'Story Park' portal. Other parents use portfolios to keep informed about how their child is progressing.</p><p>The 'Quality Education and Care Evaluation' review for teachers implemented by the area manager provides a strong critique that guides the centre's progress and development. Areas of good practice are affirmed and areas for review and development are identified. The centre manager and teachers have developed an action plan to improve educational outcomes for all children and are working to address the areas identified for review, development and implementation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is important for centre leaders and teachers to consider the following areas for review, development and implementation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The 'Quality Education and Care Evaluation' review identifies the need to build on current teacher knowledge and practice about appraisal. Teachers and appraisers need to reflect on their current practice in relation to the way children learn and consider possible alternatives and solutions, which extend and challenge children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the traditional written portfolios and how teachers and children work together to document learning stories and evaluate progress over time need to be reviewed. In addition consideration should be given to how teachers collectively gather ongoing information about a child's learning. This information should contribute to teacher practice and improve evaluation of children's progress and next learning steps.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five Maui St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five Maui St will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>27 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
