</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Islington Early Childhood Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. It is a long established community-based service in North East Valley. A parent committee governs and manages the centre.</p><p>Twenty children attend morning sessions during the week. Four-year-old children may also attend one afternoon extension session in preparation for school. The centre programme is based on a blend of free play and structured experiences. It is provided by two qualified early childhood teachers, along with a centre support teacher and parent help,</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Teachers have made good progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2011 ERO report. Self-review practices are still developing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning is supported by an interesting programme based on the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Teachers provide a wide range of experiences for children to enjoy. These include purposeful learning opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>creative and dramatic play</li>
<li>science</li>
<li>early literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>exploration and physical development</li>
<li>research using ICT.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs changing interests, strengths and needs. They value the knowledge children bring from home and use this as a starting point for learning conversations. They are skilful in the way they deliberately foster children‚Äôs ideas.</p><p>There is a family-like atmosphere where parents help in the programme and are welcome to stay and settle their children. Children and their families benefit from caring, positive relationships with their teachers. Children in this small-group setting develop strong friendships with each other. They play for long periods of time together in very well resourced indoor and outdoor areas. They help each other and have fun in their learning.</p><p>Teachers help children make connections with the local community with frequent trips to places such as the community gardens, local shops and schools. Teachers, with the help of a skilled kaiako, are building te ao MƒÅori perspectives across all aspects of the programme.</p><p>The afternoon programme for four-year olds has a deliberate focus on helping children learn social competency and team work and extending their thinking. The teachers have established useful connections with local schools to support children when they move on to school.</p><p>As part of this review, ERO investigated how well children are supported to be capable and confident mathematical learners. Teachers have a good knowledge of mathematics and how to promote this in the centre. They ensure children have many planned and incidental opportunities for mathematical learning.</p><p>Group planning is well documented with clear intended learning outcomes and with strategies and experiences to achieve these. Teachers agree they need to strengthen the way they evaluate the group planning to more clearly show how effective they have been in supporting the learning.</p><p>Teachers seek family input and ask for parents‚Äô wishes for their children‚Äôs learning. They are aware of children‚Äôs diverse backgrounds. Profile books are a rich record of what the child does at the centre and some key learning is highlighted. Learning records need to more clearly show:</p><ul>
<li>the intended learning and how teachers will support this</li>
<li>the progress children have made over time</li>
<li>how teachers support each child to be confident in their own culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><p>The experienced teaching team have worked together for many years. They undertake relevant professional development to improve their teaching. They have made changes to practice as a result of this.</p><p>The teachers are working with a provider to improve their knowledge and use of self review. They acknowledge this work needs to continue.</p><p>The parent committee ensures the centre runs smoothly. Committee members have overall responsibility for the finances, policies and procedures, employment and strategic direction. They plan for change and support new parents to join the committee and take on roles of responsibility. The committee funds professional development, additional staffing and resources for the centre. They are improvement focused. The strategic plan would be more useful if it identified the long-term priorities for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers identified, and ERO agrees, the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build self-review practices</li>
<li>develop a self-review schedule</li>
<li>strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Islington Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Islington Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern Southern Region</p><p>9 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
