</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Holmes Kindergarten is one of four kindergartens governed by the Oamaru Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten provides early education for children from three to five years of age, five days a week. The hours align to school day hours.</p><p>The team of experienced teachers has made significant improvements to its practice since the June 2011 ERO review. These improvements are ongoing and well sustained. They have established a strong team culture and have a shared understanding of the way they teach and support children‚Äôs learning. Effective professional development has helped further improve planning records and self review.</p><p>The teachers are focused on implementing their kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy which aims for children to be confident life-long learners, have strong relationships and develop positive attitudes for learning, such as risk taking and problem solving.</p><p>The kindergarten receives ongoing support from an external education service manager, the association general manager and a governing board made up of parents from the kindergarten communities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Holmes Kindergarten work and play in an environment that is welcoming and friendly. Teachers warmly greet them on arrival and have useful strategies to build a sense of belonging and to guide the child into possible learning for the day. Teachers purposefully and carefully arrange the environment to stimulate children‚Äôs interests. They listen to and respect children‚Äôs ideas and involve them in planning decisions. Children are independent and make choices about where they want to play and what they want to do.</p><p>Teachers provide a programme with a wide range of learning experiences. A strength of the programme is the way literacy is integrated throughout. Literacy is woven through learning experiences such as art, music and drama, gardening and the range of opportunities for creative expression through construction materials such as carpentry. Children also enjoy regular excursions to extend their learning and interests. They are involved in the decision making about these trips.</p><p>Where children need additional support to succeed, teachers together with children‚Äôs families, have developed plans and specific strategies to help them.</p><p>Other positive features of the kindergarten that support and promote children‚Äôs learning include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers‚Äô high- quality planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>the partnership for learning between teachers and parents</li>
<li>records of learning that show the difference teachers have made and progress children make over time.</li>
</ul><p>All teachers have learning-focused conversations with children. They use these to build on and challenge children‚Äôs ideas and thinking and enable children to make connections to other learning.</p><p>Teachers also have a passion and interest in embedding a MƒÅori dimension into their programme. They have explored what some key MƒÅori concepts mean and base their teaching practices on these. Many of the children are confident to say their full mihi and others are well supported by teachers to learn this. The team know how best to support children from Pacific cultures.</p><p>There is a strong team culture of in-depth reflection and discussion and teachers are focused on making improvements. Teachers‚Äô participation in professional development has had positive impacts for children. The head teacher provides effective leadership to the team. This promotes children's learning. There has been a significant amount of work done to improve self-review processes and practices. The team has identified the next steps to further refine this.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The teachers should continue to implement the improvements that they and the senior teacher have identified.</p><h4>Governance and management</h4><p>Kindergarten teachers, the children and their families are well supported by the association. The board has a positive relationship with the general manager who effectively and efficiently manages the kindergarten operations. As a team, she and the board have developed a useful strategic plan with a clear vision for the future with comprehensive goals that align with the kindergarten‚Äôs action plan. The general manager works with an education service manager to support the kindergarten to implement the high expectations they have for children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning. This includes meeting the specific needs of children with a diverse range of needs.</p><p>The board and leaders have identified their next steps. They have planned to conduct a review of communication systems including information and communication technologies. A workshop is planned to build on their understanding of the principles of The Treaty of Waitangi and how they apply within the organisation. The general manager and education service manager have begun to arrange further professional development for the association head teachers about leadership, self review and to develop a more robust system for managing risks during kindergarten outings.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Holmes Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Holmes Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>26 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
