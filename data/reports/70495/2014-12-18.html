</table><p>Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention operates as an integrated part of the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre.</p><p>The centre runs morning sessions for deaf children and their parents who live in Christchurch. Many of these children also attend local community-based early childhood centres.</p><p>Children take part in both individual programmes and group sessions that focus primarily on promoting their language development. They usually attend the centre for between two to five hours a week.</p><p>The centre places a strong emphasis on supporting parents/whƒÅnau to become effective communicators and first teachers of their deaf children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs teachers of the deaf are also actively involved in the regular residential courses run by Van Asch for preschoolers who are deaf and their parents/whƒÅnau who live beyond Christchurch.</p><p>The nature of the services provided by the teachers continues to evolve as they thoughtfully respond to parent feedback, changing needs and opportunities.</p><p>The teachers make good use of a range of specialist services to support them to work effectively with parents and children.</p><p>Since the January 2012 ERO review, the manager and teachers have successfully retained and built on the strengths evident at that time. They have made very good progress towards addressing the identified areas for improvement. These included further developing aspects of the programme and self review.</p><p>The centre is currently seeking relicensing under the (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is very evident in practice. It is well governed and effectively managed.</p><p>Teachers are supportive, respectful and affirming of children and their families. A strength of the centre is its welcoming and inclusive environment and the quality of relationships at all levels. A strong sense of partnership exists between teachers and parents. Children benefit from adults working together to enhance their communication skills, social development and wellbeing.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the way relationships and networking among parents is successfully promoted. These supportive relationships foster the sharing of knowledge, experiences and resources amongst parents in ways that benefit children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum serves students and their parents very well. It is based on the principles and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum and meeting the specific needs of children who are deaf. Aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are successfully integrated into the programme.</p><p>Well-planned and evaluated programmes provide children with experiences that incorporate their interests, strengths and needs. Programmes provide children with appropriate opportunities to develop and practise their language skills. There is a good balance between individual teaching, exploratory play and group sessions. The group programme includes regular musical experiences, trips into the community and a variety of literacy and mathematical activities. Teachers make effective use of regular and in-depth assessments of children‚Äôs strengths, progress and needs for planning and evaluating programmes.</p><p>The centre successfully promotes biculturalism (the culture of both deaf and hearing communities) and bilingualism (supporting children to communicate through both New Zealand Sign Language and English).</p><p>Teachers work with children in ways that successfully foster language development. They observe and listen carefully to children and respond effectively to support and extend their learning. They continue to expand the range of strategies they use to promote children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The centre is effectively led. Leadership practices promote collaboration and teamwork amongst teachers and other professionals. Good use is made of staff strengths. There is a strong focus on ongoing centre improvement. This focus is supported by reflective practices, collegial feedback and a variety of well-implemented self reviews. The manager and teachers are responsive to feedback and review findings. Ongoing professional development and support is fostering improvements to teaching programmes and practices. The Deaf Education Centre‚Äôs principal actively supports the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>Annual plans that are linked to the overall centre‚Äôs strategic plan, provides a clear focus for development.</p><p>At the time of the ERO review, the governance structure for the early intervention centre was being reviewed as part of the Ministry of Education relicensing process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the areas the manager and staff have identified as future priorities. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>exploring other ways of supporting deaf children who are under two years old and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>looking at further supporting children and parents who attend residential-based courses during and upon completion of these courses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build on initiatives such as developments in fostering biculturalism and bilingual education, as well as staff appraisal practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
