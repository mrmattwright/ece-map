</table><p>The Akoteu Lotofaleia Under 2s 2012 ERO report noted concerns about centre governance and management. The management committee has yet to fully address these significant areas for improvement. External support would help centre leaders bring about the required improvements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Lotofaleia Under 2s in Mangere, operates under the New Zealand Methodist Church and the Tongan Methodist Church Parish. The centre is governed by a management committee made up of church representatives, a parent, and centre leaders. It provides education and care for up to 25 children from babies to three years of age.</p><p>Although there are separate licences for the centre for children over two and the centre for infants and toddlers, they are operated as a single entity. They are led by a puleako/principal and a centre manager, who takes a significant role in the governance of the centre. Each centre has a supervisor who oversees the daily programme.</p><p>All the children attending the centre have Tongan heritage and most are from the local community. Some children travel from other areas and have family connections to the centre. All teachers are fluent speakers of Tongan. Five of the seven teaching staff are registered teachers. There are also two full time cooks/cleaners.</p><p>Successive ERO reports have commented on the positive and affirming relationships between teachers, children and families. Tongan language and cultural values and Christian beliefs continue to be a significant feature of the centre. ERO‚Äôs last two reports have identified the need to improve the governance and management of the centre. The health and safety concerns identified in ERO‚Äôs previous reports have for the most part been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing individualised care. There is a calm gentle tone in the centre. Children are settled and happy. They are becoming culturally competent, have connections with their community and are developing friendships.</p><p>Teachers are responsive and caring. They talk and sing to children in Tongan and encourage them to respond. Christian beliefs and Tongan cultural practices are woven into the programme and fostered during group sessions.</p><p>Most children are Tongan speakers. Teachers affirm and enrich children‚Äôs knowledge and use of the Tongan language. The welcoming and relaxed learning environment reflects Tongan identity and culture and acknowledges MƒÅori as tangata whenua. Teachers integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>Children benefit from good periods of uninterrupted play and the opportunity to make independent choices. Children‚Äôs physical development is promoted by easy access to the outside area that is set up with a variety of interesting activities. Increasing children‚Äôs access to a greater variety of open ended and challenging resources would more effectively support children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Teachers use positive guidance strategies and provide good support for children‚Äôs play. A future focus for teachers now is to look for ways to increase challenge and complexity in play and learning particularly for older children. Improved routines could also encourage children to be self-managing.</p><p>Group planning guides the programme and children‚Äôs assessment portfolios are well presented. They provide a good record of centre activities and group learning experiences.</p><p>Further professional development in assessment and planning is likely to help teachers to develop strategies to identify and build on children‚Äôs individual interests, strengths and dispositions. Teachers could also consider better ways to show how they integrate mathematics, literacy, science and technology in curriculum planning and implementation.</p><p>The management committee has recently accessed external professional support to improve governance practices. There has been some improvement in strategic planning and self-review. Despite this, a number of the areas of concern noted in ERO‚Äôs 2008 and 2012 reports have not been fully addressed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the principal manager and supervisors agree that to improve outcomes for children, teachers will need to continue to work with their professional development provider to:</p><ul>
<li>increase their understanding of current early childhood legislation, educational theories and best practice</li>
<li>develop a philosophy statement to guide teaching practice</li>
<li>focus on supporting and planning for children‚Äôs individual interests and strengths</li>
<li>develop robust self-review processes to evaluate their effectiveness in supporting children's learning and implementing <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>increase partnerships with parents.</li>
</ul><p>The management committee, manager and supervisors should act with urgency to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen organisational culture and build leadership capability in the centre</li>
<li>implement a rigorous self-review cycle to evaluate centre operations</li>
<li>strengthen strategic and annual planning and align it with centre budgets</li>
<li>hold more regular meetings, with appropriately recorded minutes</li>
<li>develop an evidence based appraisal process that meets current legislative requirements and ensure all staff, including the manager, are appraised annually by a fully registered teacher.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Lotofaleia Under 2s completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management, curriculum and self review. To meet requirements the service must:</p><ul>
<li>plan programmes that are more clearly responsive to children‚Äôs individual interests and strengths</li>
<li>ensure that the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices and that appropriate documentation and records are developed, maintained and regularly reviewed</li>
<li>establish more formal and regular self-review practices to support ongoing improvement and more sustainable good practice</li>
<li>implement suitable human resource management practices</li>
<li>as part of its annual report to the annual general meeting, report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their Equity Funding.</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
