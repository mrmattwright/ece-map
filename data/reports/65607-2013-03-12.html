<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Barnardos KidStart Nelson provides home-based care and learning for children from birth to five years in a KidStart caregiver&rsquo;s home. The network operates under the umbrella of Barnardos New Zealand, and is managed through the Wellington Regional Management Unit. Management set expectations for service delivery and provide a comprehensive range of policies and procedures to guide professional practice at all levels. Management practices and local leadership from the Nelson unit foster good quality care and education and help to support ongoing improvements to the service.</p><p>Two visiting teachers, who are qualified early childhood teachers, regularly visit educators and children in the educator&rsquo;s home. This teacher is responsible for providing support and guidance for the educators and making sure the homes meet health and safety standards. Educators are well supported in their roles by KidStart staff and children receive good quality care and education. All educators have initial and ongoing professional learning opportunities and receive a practice certificate, from Barnardos, renewed every two years.</p><p>This ERO review evaluates the quality of education and care provided by a sample group of educators, support provided to these educators and the quality of support given by Barnardos KidStart management.</p><p>ERO and managers have agreed that the next steps for development include self review, provision for M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, appraisal and assessment practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the April 2009 ERO report, Barnardos KidStart services have been restructured. The new licensee, Barnardos Services Business Manager, and a practice leader were appointed during 2012. Together they provide professional support for the regional teaching team.</p><p>Teaching staff continue to manage the Nelson network and promote ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care practices for children. They have been quick to adapt to new roles under the restructure.</p><p>Educators participate in a range of professional learning opportunities facilitated by Barnardos KidStart. There is an expectation that educators will support the learning and development of each child through the provision of programmes aligned to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and that they will regularly document children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>There are currently fourteen educators in the Nelson Network and all are qualified as Barnardos educators</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>The network philosophy is clearly evident in practice. A varied programme is closely linked to children's interests and strengths.</p><p>Home environments are well adapted to cater for toddlers and young children. Children can easily access a wide range of suitable resources that encourage choice of play, indoors and out. Educators access KidStart equipment and materials to supplement those in their homes. Outside areas have shade provision and gardens areas promote exploration, discovery and care of living things. Climbing equipment fosters physical challenge and development.</p><p>Positive, friendly interactions are evident. Educators are nurturing and have established close relationships with children and wh&#257;nau. Children are confident to approach adults to share achievements, ask questions and contribute to learning conversations. They initiate in-depth discussions and playing cooperatively.</p><p>Educators and visiting teachers know children and their families well. Visiting teachers organise monthly playgroup sessions for educators and children. These playgroups allow children to have a broader range of experiences and to develop social relationships with similar aged children. Some educators arrange for children to attend external music sessions or attend alternative playgroups organised by local churches.</p><p>Records of each child&rsquo;s learning are regularly updated in their attractively presented &lsquo;Te T&#333;ku Pukapuka&rsquo;. While there is some variability in quality, they generally provide a good record of learning over time. ERO, managers and visiting teachers agree that these records should be strengthened to include next steps and capture the responses to learning of children and parents.</p><p>Strong working relationships are evident amongst visiting teachers, educators and children. Educators seek advice if needed and engage in ongoing professional dialogue. Educators report they are supported to grow professionally through regular visits and the provision of specific training courses.</p><p>Visiting teachers make good use of their in-home visits to record children&rsquo;s learning and to provide feedback and advice to educators. During these visits the progress of each child is discussed and progressions and next steps in learning are identified. A learning story for each child present is written. These stories model effective writing to educators. Records are kept of any compliance activities.</p><p>Appraisal processes for visiting teachers were recently reviewed, resulting in new job descriptions and goal setting. There are plans to strengthen appraisal through the use of observational feedback from the team leader. The introduction of appraisal of educators is planned for 2013.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and managers agree next steps for development include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing development of programmes and practices to support M&#257;ori children's success</li>
<li>further development and implementation of robust self-review practice</li>
<li>implementation of newly developed appraisal processes</li>
<li>improving the consistency and quality of children&rsquo;s learning stories.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Barnardos KidStart Nelson completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
