<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>ABC Manurewa Central is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>ABC Manurewa Central provides all day programmes for babies, toddlers and older children up to five years of age. The centre is made up of two separate, refurbished houses on the same site. The Kiwi house (previously ABC Manurewa Central Tahi) provides babies and toddlers with separate indoor areas and shared outdoor space. Children who are over three years old are catered for in the Pukeko house (previously ABC Manurewa Central Rua) next door.</p><p>At the time of the January 2010 ERO report, the centre had a new teaching team, including a new centre manager. Together they were working to overcome concerns identified in previous ERO reports and to improve the quality of care and education for children. Since 2010, the ABC centres have been bought by the Kidicorp group and the licences for ABC Manurewa Central Tahi and Rua have been merged into one. The centre continues to be led by the same capable centre manager and she is supported by a well qualified teaching team.</p><p>Staff promote a child-centred teaching and learning philosophy. They respect and celebrate the language, culture and identity of M&#257;ori tamariki, who make up 75 percent of children, and children of other cultures. Many teachers are able to speak to children from some Pacific nations in their home languages.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily and are engaged in the programme. For most of the day, children are free to choose from a variety of activities in the indoor and outdoor areas. They are familiar with the routines of shared mat and eating times and enjoy each others&rsquo; company. Babies and toddlers are well cared for, have flexible routines and are supported at their individual stages of development.</p><p>The manager leads the centre effectively. She is working with teachers to build a positive team culture, respectful working relationships and collegial trust. The manager recognises teachers&rsquo; strengths and encourages them to take leadership in different areas of the programme. The manager and teachers are strengthening their ability to reflect critically on their practices and to continue improving the programme and environment for children.</p><p>Teachers work as a team and welcome opportunities for professional learning and growth. They plan programmes for groups of children in response to children&rsquo;s interests. The programme supports children&rsquo;s language, literacy and numeracy development. Teachers have strengthened the bicultural aspects of the programme and support children&rsquo;s te reo and Te Ao M&#257;ori learning in different ways during the day.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are positive and respectful. Teachers know children, their parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga well. Teachers communicate regularly with parents about their children&rsquo;s learning and centre developments. Parents are encouraged to share their skills and aspects of their culture in the programme. Their opinions are valued and are used to support decisions about the programme and centre. Managers and teachers recognise the need to further strengthen the place of parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga in the learning programme. This should help to further promote children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity.</p><p>Kidicorp managers provide a clear strategic direction for the centre and very good professional support for the centre manager and teachers. They are mutually respectful, and are working collaboratively with the centre manager and teaching team to strengthen and sustain centre improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kidicorp managers, the centre manager and ERO agree that key next steps for teachers at ABC Manurewa Central include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening teachers&rsquo; understanding and use of self review</li>
<li>continuing to notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests</li>
<li>providing opportunities in the programme for more complex learning, especially for older children</li>
<li>developing a model of professional learning and development for the teaching team that promotes critical reflection and further supports culturally responsive leadership and teaching practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Manurewa Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
