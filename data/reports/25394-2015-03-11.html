</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Highbrook provides education and care for 150 children with up to 75 under 2 years of age. The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on children learning in a stimulating environment with real experiences that involve problem solving, decision making and risk taking.</p><p>The Lollipop Educare organisation provides a wide range of governance and management systems to underpin centre operations. These include professional guidance, curriculum advice and a mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers. A professional services manager visits the centre regularly and provides professional advice and support for leaders and teachers.</p><p>There are nine rooms in the centre. Children come together for meals in the centre‚Äôs wharekai. Parents work nearby but many live well outside the immediate community. The multi-ethnic teaching team reflects the diversity of children's families.</p><p>This is ERO‚Äôs second review of this centre. Leaders addressed recommendations made in the 2011 ERO report through whole staff professional development and teacher appraisal.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Highbrook promotes highly effective learning outcomes for children. Children and their whƒÅnau are well supported by teachers to transition positively into the centre. Teachers share with parents the importance of children learning through play and the value of play in preparing them to be lifelong learners.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the needs and interests of children. They recognise the importance of consistency and continuity in the care and education of young children. Primary caregivers for individual children contribute to the secure foundation for children‚Äôs development within the centre. Adults trust children to develop as independent learners. They provide a calm pace that allows infants and toddlers the appropriate time and space to follow their own interests.</p><p>Children are settled in the centre. They are trusted to make their own choices and have established genuine friendships with teachers and their peers. They are becoming competent communicators and confidently articulate their interests and needs to adults. Familiar routines and centre organisation, support children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging. They demonstrate good self-help skills.</p><p>Children under two years of age are confident explorers. They happily engage in play and activities with their peers and are learning appropriate ways to manage their relationships with each other. They are confident and comfortable with teachers and participate willingly during group times.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They show a strong commitment to valuing children‚Äôs language, culture and identity, recognising individual strengths and knowledge, and family aspirations. Teachers encourage children to learn at their own pace providing periods of uninterrupted play to enable them to repeat or sustain an activity.</p><p>Teachers provide a varied range of experiences for children. While they plan separately for infants and toddlers, there is continuity in planning and careful transitioning as children move between rooms. Teachers plan meaningful learning activities, which are responsive to the interests and perspectives of children and whƒÅnau. The programmes include opportunities for children to learn more about tikanga Maori.</p><p>Through professional development, teachers are becoming increasingly confident in their understanding and use of te reo MƒÅori me ona tikanga. They recognise the importance of continuing to provide opportunities to support the culture, language and identity of all children and to consider ways to foster MƒÅori children‚Äôs identity.</p><p>Teachers share children‚Äôs learning with parents and families. They identify each child‚Äôs strengths and interests and plan for their growth and development. Parents can see in the stories about children's learning how children are developing over time. Parents can also contribute to their child‚Äôs portfolio of learning. Literacy, science and the arts are integrated throughout the learning programme supporting children to become lifelong learners. Quality work capturing children‚Äôs reflections is displayed throughout the centre. Older children are extended in their art and dance and movement.</p><p>Children enjoy playing in the well-resourced, expansive outdoor environment where they develop their physical skills and explore the adventure style setting. Teachers change the equipment and areas of play to suit children‚Äôs current interests. Children respect their environment and appreciate the varying levels of challenge the outdoor space provides for them. Centre leaders continue to review the impact of the restrictive fencing in the outdoor play area.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre is well led by a management team focussed on improving outcomes for children. They review centre systems and support teachers to review their teaching practice. They work hard to realise parent‚Äôs social, cultural and learning aspirations through strategic planning.</p><p>ERO and centre managers also agreed that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>deepening teachers self enquiry to improve their own teaching practice</li>
<li>reviewing the curriculum to increase children‚Äôs learning in mathematics</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy across the centre</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Highbrook completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Highbrook will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
