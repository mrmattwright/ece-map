</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (213) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (213P) is located in Harewood. It is one of 11 early childhood education and care centres, in Christchurch, owned and administered by the Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The service owners have a strong philosophy, useful policies and procedures and a framework for monitoring health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the effective operation of the centre.</p><p>Some of the areas for review and development identified in the 2011 ERO report have been successfully addressed including interactions, self review and some aspects of assessment and planning. The centre director has identified that aspects of long and short-term planning and evaluation could be further improved to build on the good practices evident during this review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres Service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO observed that children benefit from interactions with teachers that are sustained and meaningful. Teachers are friendly, caring and nurturing in the ways they work with children. They actively involve themselves in children‚Äôs play and extend their independence and learning. Teachers notice children and respond well to their individual interests, strengths and capabilities. They listen carefully and talk with children in ways that support their oral language development.</p><p>ERO observed children who were settled and well engaged in activities of interest for sustained periods of time. Teachers actively fostered positive and inclusive relationships with children and between children. Children shared ideas and played well alongside and with each other.</p><p>Children have easy access to a wide range of good quality learning experiences and resources to extend on their interests and learning. The learning environment is well organised and attractively presented to inspire children‚Äôs curiosity and participation in the programme. Children have many opportunities to use their senses, be creative and extend their physical skills.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are well integrated across the programme in ways that are meaningful for children. Teachers skilfully engage children in story-telling, imaginary play, singing and waiata.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value children‚Äôs different cultures, languages and identities. Children have many opportunities to learn about New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage in ways that are respectful of the MƒÅori culture. Teachers are making increasing use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. Children whose first language is not English are helped to extend their language and interactions with other children and adults. Children with special education needs are well supported and included in the programme.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs participation and learning in the programme through attractive portfolios, journals and wall displays. Transition into and within the centre is effectively managed with a focus on the individual needs of children and families. Teachers have made purposeful links with local schools to support children when they go to school.</p><p>Centre leadership is professional and well informed. The centre director sets high expectations and focuses on developing a shared understanding of the service philosophy, priorities and best practice. Teachers communicate well and work effectively as a team. Teachers are supported to grow their professional practices and undertake professional development to help them better support the specific needs of diverse learners. Teachers with particular interests are given opportunities to extend their leadership skills and abilities.</p><p>Self review is effectively led, valued and used to make ongoing improvements to learning and teaching practices that benefit children. Self review is a shared process that involves all staff. Teachers effectively use reflection to improve learning and teaching practices. Changes made as a result of reviews are monitored and adjusted where appropriate.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs operation and curriculum are guided by the Kindercare Service‚Äôs long-term goals. Senior managers have recently extended this plan to identify what success looks like in meeting centre goals. They have identified that their next steps are to support each centre to:</p><ul>
<li>develop long-term and annual planning so that it can prioritise how it will meet the Kindercare vision and goals</li>
<li>develop a planned approach to self review that aligns to centre priorities and the service‚Äôs goals.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders have identified steps to improve planning and assessment documentation in the centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the next steps for children‚Äôs learning to show how teachers will add value to children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>consistently identifying intentional teaching strategies in planning</li>
<li>strengthening the evaluation of planned programmes to include the impact that teaching strategies have on children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>increasing parent and child views in assessment and planning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre director has identified that leadership roles within the centre could be more defined and strengthened.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (213P) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (213P) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>9 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
