</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glendowie Christian Kindergarten offers five morning sessions for children over two years of age and six-hour sessions for four year old children. Session hours were increased in 2015 to meet the needs of the community. The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy is based on encouraging children‚Äôs learning in an environment of Christian character and values.</p><p>The kindergarten is operated by a charitable trust. Trustees are members of the Glendowie Presbyterian Church and are responsible for financial and operational matters. The head teacher has responsibility for daily management of the kindergarten. Most teachers have a long-standing association with the kindergarten and the local area. Five of the staff are registered teachers.</p><p>Positive features identified in ERO‚Äôs 2013 report have been maintained. These include effective teaching practices and trusting relationships with children and families. ERO recommended that teachers improve internal evaluation and programme planning to better cater for individual children‚Äôs learning. Teachers have made very good progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A centre culture of care and respect provides a strong foundation for children‚Äôs wellbeing and belonging. Children settle quickly into the programme and are confident explorers. They show initiative, ask questions, and capably manage their relationships with teachers and other children. Older children engage in imaginative and cooperative play for long periods.</p><p>Teachers value the information that parents share about their children‚Äôs home and community experiences. They have a deliberate focus on enhancing relationships with families. Parents who spoke to ERO value family events and are highly satisfied with the kindergarten. They appreciate teachers‚Äô care and approachability, and their support for each individual child to settle into the kindergarten programme.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their families. They interact respectfully with and listen carefully to children. Teachers use good questions to prompt children‚Äôs problem solving and independent thinking. Children and teachers share information and ideas, work together and learn alongside each other.</p><p>Teachers are committed to developing practices that reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. They are becoming more confident to use waiata and basic words in te reo MƒÅori during group times. Teachers could now work towards integrating more te reo MƒÅori in spontaneous play situations.</p><p>The curriculum is highly effective in promoting positive outcomes for children. Creatively designed and thoughtfully presented indoor and outdoor areas prompt children‚Äôs inquiry and investigation. Literacy, science and mathematical learning opportunities are included in the programme in meaningful ways. A focus on nutrition and physical activity is evident in daily activities. Teachers are working with local schools to consider how they can work together to better support children as they move to school.</p><p>Teachers skilfully use individual learning plans to document children‚Äôs interests and next steps in learning. Assessment records show how well teachers recognise and celebrate the unique ways each child develops and learns. Children‚Äôs profile books clearly display how teachers have supported children to make progress over time. Teachers recognise that planning for older children in the Fab4 programme could be strengthened by re-establishing links with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have developed shared understandings about effective teaching practices. Recent professional development has supported them to make useful improvements to internal evaluation systems. Governance systems have been established and the kindergarten‚Äôs long-term and annual goals guide ongoing improvement.</p><p>Trustees should now work with the head teacher to ensure that kindergarten procedures are updated in a timely manner in response to regulatory changes. Trustees‚Äô plan to appoint an external appraiser for the head teacher is appropriate to support her professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on existing good practices, the next steps for the trustees and teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>improving teacher appraisal processes</li>
<li>embedding and strengthening internal evaluation processes</li>
<li>continuing to develop bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glendowie Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, trustees and the head teacher should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>procedures and practices are updated in a timely manner in response to regulatory changes</li>
<li>excursion and risk assessment management practices are improved</li>
<li>teacher appraisal meets the requirements of the Education Council.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glendowie Christian Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
