</table><p>Mangapai Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangapai Playcentre is licensed to provide education and care for up to 18 children, including 12 aged under two years, and currently operates two sessions per week. The centre operates as a parent cooperative and is part of the Playcentre Aotearoa national organisation.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together in a fun, nurturing learning environment. WhƒÅnau are recognised and valued as first educators of their children. Adult education programmes are offered to all parents who enrol their children at Playcentre. Qualifications gained through these programmes are required for sessions to receive funding.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report acknowledged children as competent, confident learners in a welcoming and inclusive environment. Good opportunities were provided for them to engage in physically active and challenging play, to problem solve and negotiate. These positive aspects have been maintained. Areas for continued development included internal evaluation, programme planning and bicultural practice. There has been some progress in these areas.</p><p>A new regional structure for Playcentre Aotearoa came into effect in June 2019. Regional staff are responsible for establishing effective management systems to support each centre. Support personnel visit centres regularly to carry out administrative tasks and model effective teaching, programme planning and evaluation practices for centre members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa, Northern North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident in the centre environment. They make choices about their play and engage in a wide range of experiences, indoors and outdoors. The spacious outdoor area and extensive gardens offer good opportunities for physically active play. Children have a positive sense of belonging as they explore and make discoveries alongside whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children's work is valued. Artwork is respectfully stored and available for children to revisit. These records provide a good record of children's development as they become more competent at expressing their thoughts and ideas on paper. Adults could now consider adding stories that accompany children's work to further support literacy development.</p><p>Children of all ages play together in a mixed-age setting that allows them to learn alongside older, more experienced peers and to nurture the younger children.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is visible in the centre environment and heard in the use of karakia and waiata during session time. The Playcentre philosophy includes a commitment to honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Centre members have identified that they would like to continue to strengthen their bicultural practice.</p><p>Adults are responsive to children's requests as they lead their own play and learning. They recognise children's individual communication styles and provide resources and language to support further learning. More experienced adults provide good role models as they support newer members.</p><p>Parents maintain individual portfolios of learning for their own children. Some also contribute learning stories to other children's portfolios. The progression of parents' learning is evident in these portfolios as they continue to engage in Playcentre adult education programmes over time. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is visible throughout these records.</p><p>Children's current interests are recorded at the end of sessions. Parents/whƒÅnau sometimes take these ideas for children's learning to their homes. Centre leaders are keen to establish connections and continuity of children's learning between the two sessions that are currently offered each week.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to refine and develop programme planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the evaluative aspect of reviewing centre programmes and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and strengthen strategic planning to more effectively guide the centre's future direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The regional manager and support personnel agree that key next steps for the region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing targeted support for centre members to establish effective strategic and annual planning, with links to the long-term goals of Playcentre Aotearoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the personnel who are employed to support centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing effective programme planning and evaluation processes that support and extend the learning of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangapai Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>1 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
