</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Khandallah Nursery School is an early learning service privately owned by Life Learning Aotearoa Ltd located in Wellington. It provides education and care for 30 children, including 19 up to two years. At the time of the review there were 31 children enrolled, two who identify as MƒÅori. Governance and management is undertaken by the umbrella organisation Little Schools.</p><p>The owner has a clear vision for the organisation and is responsible for setting overall strategic and policy direction. The management team comprises of three qualified and experienced early childhood and primary school teachers. Mentor teachers monitor the quality of teaching and learning and support teachers‚Äô ongoing professional learning, growth and development. A head teacher has been appointed for the period of one year. There have been other staff changes.</p><p>The philosophy places importance on developing foundations for lifelong learning and enabling a smooth transition between this service, to other Little School centres and onto primary school.</p><p>This is the first report for Khandallah Nursery School.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in a range of teacher-designed activities or self-directed play. They have easy access to environments that are well resourced and encourage exploration. Teachers use a range of strategies to extend children's learning.</p><p>Learning opportunities for children are successfully promoted through care times and routines. Responsive caregiving is highly evident and supports infants to form secure attachments. In the toddlers' rooms there is a suitable focus on developing children's thinking, independence and social competence.</p><p>Nursery School's philosophy is currently under review. When completed the identified valued learning outcomes should be clearly evident in practice and all documentation.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are evident in the environment. Te ao MƒÅori is visible through written reo, artefacts and other resources. The diverse cultures of enrolled children are visible and valued within the programme.</p><p>Relationships with parents and their families are apparent. A range of strategies are used to regularly inform them about aspects of the programme. Aspirations are gathered and form the basis of their children's individual goals.</p><p>Programme planning effectively responds to the individual needs and interests of infants and toddlers. Teachers regularly contribute to group planning. Within this, individual children's goals and interests are identified. Encouraging parents to contribute to this on an ongoing basis would add value to their learning. Formative assessment for individual children identifies what learning is taking place, emerging friendships and communication.</p><p>Evaluation of children's learning needs to be strengthened and more clearly focused on the outcomes of the programme provided. Teachers should consider how to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>better acknowledge progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently promote children's individual culture, language and identity in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how parent aspirations contribute to the programme plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine relevant, specific next steps for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Well-considered centre transitions into, between and onto the neighbouring Little School centre are collaboratively undertaken by staff, parents and children. These are individualised and sensitively managed.</p><p>The service has yet to engage with the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> early childhood curriculum document. It is timely for management to promote a deeper understanding of the shifts in teacher practice required to fully enact the intent of this document.</p><p>Good support is available for leaders and teachers to develop their practice. Professional learning is valued and suited to staff needs. Opportunities for leadership and collegial discussion are evident. A positive team culture is evident. The head teacher seeks ways to grow staff knowledge and practice. Appraisal requires further strengthening. The policy should be revised and fully implemented to include all aspects of the Education Council's expectations for meaningful appraisal.</p><p>A suitable policy framework guides centre operation. Managers have commenced work to document and align systems and processes to promote consistency across the service. The strategic plan focuses on business priorities for Nursery School. The newly developed teaching and learning component appropriately identifies goals linked to positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The purpose and use of internal evaluation is not yet well understood. Spontaneous review is regularly undertaken and links to improving outcomes for children. A useful framework is in place to support planned review. A next step is to clearly identify measurable indicators, based on best practice, to guide the process and promote well informed decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, managers and leaders agree that priorities at centre level are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At governance level, priorities are to continue to support development of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' engagement with the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a revised philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the teacher appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Khandallah Nursery School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the service should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>endorsement of teachers' practising certificates meets a reliable and consistent standard, and all Education Council Requirements are met</p>
</li>
</ul><p>teachers engage in professional development to support their understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Khandallah Nursery School will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
