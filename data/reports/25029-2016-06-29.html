</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Litttle Learners Childcare provides for up to 50 children including up to 20 two years old. The centre is in a modern, purpose-built facility. Children are catered for in two age-related groups in adjoining rooms. They share the outdoor area and often play as a mixed-age group.</p><p>Children's cultural backgrounds reflect the local community. Many of the families are recent immigrants to New Zealand and have English as an additional language.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims to provide a 'home away from home,' with teachers who nurture and care for children. The teaching team includes five fully qualified teachers. Many staff members have worked together in the centre for several years. As a result, their relationships with parents are well established.</p><p>There have been recent changes in staffing and the management structure of the centre. The owners are now becoming more closely involved in the centre and more familiar with the requirements of early childhood education. This should help them to support the centre manager and team leaders.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted many positive aspects of the centre including relationships between teachers and children, bicultural practice and children's learning opportunities. These good practices continue to be evident. The report also identified further development of the curriculum and professional learning for teachers as areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre and confidently approach adults to initiate conversations. They are familiar with the pattern and routines of the day. Children are highly social and engage well with their play. Many children are able to sustain play over time. They are respectful of each other and cooperate well during creative play. Children are keen to learn and take good advantage of the learning opportunities that teachers provide for them. There is a balance between child-directed play and teacher-initiated activities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers play in a welcoming environment. They are settled in their interactions with teachers and with each other. They explore freely and have good access to appropriate resources. Teachers are responsive to their individual needs.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and children are positive. Teachers engage easily in children's conversations and are interested in and responsive to children's questions and ideas. Teachers supervise children effectively and routines are well implemented.</p><p>The centre manager provides good leadership for teachers in bicultural practice and in promoting te ao MƒÅori. Several teachers support children to learn through their home languages. This helps children to settle into the centre and to build relationships with their peers. These teachers also assist parents to fully understand discussions about their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Parents share worthwhile information about their children. Teachers add to this information to establish a more complete picture of the child as an individual and as a learner. Teachers consider the ages and stages of development of groups of children when they plan for the day.</p><p>Teachers evaluate the programmes they have provided. Teachers should now consider how they could respond more closely to individual children‚Äôs interests. They could also consider how they can extend the complexity of children‚Äôs play to promote critical thinking and problem solving.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre governance and management structures are currently being reviewed and a strategic plan has yet to be developed to guide centre operations and ongoing improvements. The owners and manager should also establish:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effective management planning and systems, up-date policies and procedures, and a robust performance appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems for the regular review of all aspects of centre operations, that evaluate the quality of provision for children and assures the owners that all legal requirements are met.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager and teachers could deepen their programme evaluation to consider the extent to which their practices, and particularly their programme for older children, reflect the expectations of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and demonstrate a good understanding of current theories in early childhood education.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the owners and centre manager seek external guidance to improve management documentation and processes and to support teachers to improve programmes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Litttle Learners Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified three areas of non-compliance. To address these, the owners must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish policies and procedures, and keep the required documentation, to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to promote the health and safety of children and adults in the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement an ongoing process of improvement focused internal evaluation that considers all aspects of centre operations and informs strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop suitable human resource practices including a system of regular appraisal that meets the requirements of the Education Council of NZ.</p>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development.

Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
