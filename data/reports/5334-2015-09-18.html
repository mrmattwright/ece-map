</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Moera Kindergarten provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. School-length days are provided three times a week and morning sessions are offered twice weekly. The kindergarten is licensed for 44 children. All teachers are fully qualified and the programme is assisted by support staff. The kindergarten is the oldest in Lower Hutt and has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>Key features of the kindergarten‚Äôs context include a diverse, multi-cultural local community, participation in health and wellbeing programmes and strong links with Randwick School and a local sustainable gardens cluster.</p><p>The August 2012 ERO report identified some areas requiring further development. These included strengthening assessment, self review and appraisal. Some progress is evident in these areas and teachers remain committed to strengthening their practice.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes of General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergartens reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play happily, and demonstrate a sense of belonging at the kindergarten. They are purposefully engaged in a wide range of self-selected learning experiences. Teachers know children well. They play alongside them and make connections to their interests. A wide choice of spaces and relevant resources is provided to encourage exploration. The outdoor environment is particularly well-considered, interesting and inviting.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate nurturing and respectful interactions with children. Their conversations help to extend children‚Äôs language. There are many opportunities for collaborative and sustained play and children‚Äôs independence is promoted in a range of contexts.</p><p>Bicultural practice is well integrated throughout the curriculum and environment. Teachers show a commitment to using te reo MƒÅori in the programme. They should continue to develop their understanding of how they might promote success for MƒÅori in this context. Pacific cultures are reflected through the resources. Teachers should continue to explore ways to strengthen strategies to promote success for Pacific learners.</p><p>Strong connections with the local school support children‚Äôs transitions. Teachers work collaboratively with families, external agencies and schools to ensure children with additional learning needs have every opportunity for success.</p><p>Records of children‚Äôs learning activities are easily accessed by children and their families. Leaders, teachers and ERO agree that assessment, planning and evaluation practice should be further strengthened. Teachers need to more consistently identify the specific learning that is happening for children. They should plan and document the deliberate teaching strategies used to extend learning for individuals and groups of children. These changes should lead to clearer pictures of the progression of children‚Äôs learning over time.</p><p>The experienced head teacher knows families and the community well. She leads a collaborative team aimed at supporting the wellbeing of children and their families. It is timely for the team to review their philosophy statement so that it more explicitly reflects the curriculum emphases and desired outcomes for children at the kindergarten. The revised philosophy should then be supported by indicators to describe quality practice and effective outcomes to enable teachers to evaluate the programme.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and improvement-focussed. Review of aspects of the curriculum has led to some improvements. A next step is for teachers to further develop shared understandings of evaluative self review processes that lead to ongoing improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. The PPMs should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to undertake more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These show how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements, and at times, make recommendations. The reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt City Kindergartens. ERO identified that within the current operating model the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified that priorities for improvement should include:</p><p>developing consistent practices and shared understandings about assessment and planning for learning</p><ul>
<li>review of the kindergarten philosophy and establish quality indicators to guide and evaluate practice</li>
<li>strengthening the evaluative aspect of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making at a strategic level identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Moera Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Moera Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>18 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
