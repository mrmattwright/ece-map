</table><p>Whiz Kids¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whiz Kids is a small, privately-owned centre. It offers education and care for 35 children, including 12 up to two years of age. Children play and learn in two separate rooms and outdoor play spaces. All children identify as MƒÅori and some also have MƒÅori/Tongan heritage. The Whiz Kids philosophy emphasises the importance of learning through play, and establishing a sense of belonging at the centre by children learning about their cultures.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, there have been significant staff changes, including a new head teacher in each room. The centre owner continues to appoint teacher trainees as a way of supporting them to gain early childhood teaching qualifications.</p><p>There has been some good progress in addressing the areas identified for improvement in the 2016 ERO report. The centre owner has developed strategic and annual action plans, and has introduced an appraisal system. Infants and toddlers have ready access to their outside play area. The teaching team continues to build shared understandings about guiding children's play and learning. There is still work to be done on evaluating the learning programme, and developing shared understandings about internal evaluation processes and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Staff intentionally use culturally responsive practices. Children have many opportunities to hear and learn te reo MƒÅori and their other home languages, including English. Staff are very aware of children's cultural backgrounds. They naturally integrate te reo and relevant tikanga MƒÅori practices into the daily programme. These culturally inclusive approaches with children help to support success for MƒÅori and all children.</p><p>Staff thoughtfully prepare the environments to foster children's sense of belonging and cultural connections to the centre. They show a genuine interest in children's learning and development. Staff allow children time to choose their interests, and explore the resources. Children spend long periods of time engaged in play with and alongside others.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience calm routines and respectful relationships with attentive, caring adults. They have easy access to the indoor and outdoor play areas and a range of appropriate resources. Staff could now consider how these children could have more regular opportunities to explore creative and sensory activities.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be involved in and contribute to the centre. They share their goals and wishes for their children's learning. Staff are beginning to incorporate these aspirations into each child's individual planning.</p><p>An external provider is assisting the centre owner with implementing an appraisal system. Teaching as Inquiry (TAI) is a significant component of the process. Although TAI helps teachers focus on the impact of their teaching, it is timely to include a performance review aspect to support teachers to meet all the requirements of the Teaching Council and of their role/job descriptions.</p><p>Strategic and annual action plans set priorities for centre development. Leaders and teachers participate in targeted professional learning and development. Internal evaluation is becoming established. The centre manager recognises the importance of continuing to increase staff capability in internal evaluation and curriculum provision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes to ensure a focus on extending children's learning, and planning for intentional teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly evaluating the strategic and annual action plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing shared understandings of internal evaluation practices and the impact on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that accurate health and safety records are kept.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre owner:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continues to seek support from the Ministry of Education to ensure policies, procedures and practices meet all legal requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides relevant professional learning and development to improve child assessment, programme planning, evaluation of learning and teaching, and internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whiz Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
