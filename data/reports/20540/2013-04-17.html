<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Glenavon Early Childhood Centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and to sustain high quality performance.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Glenavon Early Childhood Centre is located in the grounds of Glenavon School in Blockhouse Bay, Auckland. In 2010 the centre changed its service from sessional to full-day education and care. The centre is open during school terms with hours of operation that match the school day. Teachers have established a close working relationship with the adjoining new entrant classes.</p><p>The committee of the Glenavon Early Childhood Centre Incorporated Society includes the Glenavon School principal who is the licensee of the centre. The committee provides governance and support for the staff. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy identifies the interactions that children have with people, places and things as significant. Teachers value the learning process and constructing knowledge alongside children.</p><p>The majority of centre families are recent immigrants to New Zealand. Many children are confident speakers of several languages, with English as a second or third language. Family involvement in children&rsquo;s learning and centre programmes is highly valued.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s premises have recently been extended and redeveloped. The work environment for adults has been improved by the addition of specific areas for administration, meetings and a staffroom. Children&rsquo;s play and learning spaces have benefitted from modernisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The 2010 ERO report acknowledged the high quality of cultural inclusion which has resulted in strong partnerships with families, effective management and respectful children who are engaged in their learning. These positive features continue to be evident in the centre.</p><p>Children value and make the most of their time at the centre. Respectful relationships are evident during structured and child-initiated play sessions. Children listen, respond thoughtfully to each other and have a sense of belonging and trust in the centre. They confidently express their interests and ideas.</p><p>Teachers build children&rsquo;s confidence by promoting a sense of cultural identity. Cultural days and opportunities parents have to lead parts of the programme help build an inclusive and supportive community where the diversity of families is celebrated. Teachers support children to value and feel confident in using their home language. Children often play cooperatively using English as the common language.</p><p>Teachers use te reo and include tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the day. Children are confident with protocols such as introducing themselves in te reo M&#257;ori when formally addressing the group. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are evident in portfolios. Treaty agreements between teachers and children form the basis for teaching and learning relationships.</p><p>Teachers focus on preparing children for a smooth transition to school through regular reciprocal visits with new entrant classes. They highlight thinking and literacy processes for children while responding to their individual interests. Literacy learning is modelled and integrated throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers ensure that parents are well informed. They share detailed information about children&rsquo;s progress and development with parents and provide updates about centre programmes. Teachers lead sessions to support parents as children&rsquo;s first educators. Parents reading to their child on arrival at the centre and sharing their portfolio are regular features of the centre&rsquo;s good quality practices.</p><p>Members of the committee bring a range of worthwhile skills, knowledge and experience to their role. They have an ongoing commitment to the centre and the role it plays in the community. The committee uses strategic planning to focus on agreed directions. They provide sound support and guidance for the head teacher.</p><p>The 2010 report recommended that managers establish a manageable programme of development and review. Progress has been made in this area. Professional development supports centre and individual goals. Appraisal and self-review processes are reflective and improvement focused.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree it is now timely to clarify and simplify the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and other key documentation. The effectiveness of self review could be enhanced by narrowing the focus so investigations can be more purposeful and productive.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Glenavon Early Childhood completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
