</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lovingcare Kindergarten is a small centre in Henderson, Auckland that provides all day education and care for up to 30 children over two years old. The centre operates as part of the Auckland Christian Mandarin Church and is governed by a management committee. Christian beliefs and values are reflected in the centre programme and the philosophy.</p><p>Progress has been made in responding to areas for development noted in ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report. Planning and assessment processes and performance management have improved. Good management and leadership continue to be evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children explore the environment freely and make decisions about their own play choices. The learning environment is well organised and children have easy access to appropriate learning resourcing.</p><p>Some good teaching practices that support children&rsquo;s play are evident. Teachers skilfully use home languages to communicate with parents and children. They provide activities for children, but not all children engage well with these activities. Teachers could review routines such as group times and early pack up times and how they impact on children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers also need to increase the quality of conversations and interactions amongst children and with staff to better support children's engagement.</p><p>Teachers collect good planning and assessment information. They know children well and keep good records about their individual interests. Portfolios reflect children&rsquo;s participation in the programme. Teachers could use this information to better show how they respond and extend children&rsquo;s learning interests over time.</p><p>Teachers are currently carrying out a review of their bicultural curriculum. Some basic words and phrases in te reo M&#257;ori are displayed in the centre. As part of the review teachers could consider:</p><ul>
<li>how they can support each other to use te reo M&#257;ori naturally as part of the programme</li>
<li>referring to Ministry of Education resources that help promote greater educational success for M&#257;ori children, as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager has a professional approach to centre operations. She receives good support from the governing committee. Teachers access appropriate professional learning and development. The centre manager has well-established processes in place that support self review. Self review is closely aligned to the centre&rsquo;s strategic plan and includes input from staff and parents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that key next steps for ongoing centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that self review is focused on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>improving teachers&rsquo; knowledge to support those children with diverse learning needs including teaching strategies to better engage boys</li>
<li>strengthening learning partnerships between parents, wh&#257;nau and teachers including making programme planning more visible for parents and wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that centre managers access professional learning and development for teachers to support these improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lovingcare Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lovingcare Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
