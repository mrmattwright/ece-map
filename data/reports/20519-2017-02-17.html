</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Parnell provides full day education and care for 42 children including 15 up to two years of age. It is part of the BestStart Education and Care Centres' organisation which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>The centre has separate spaces for children up to two years and for children between the ages of two and five. The centre's philosophy focuses on inclusion, respect, relationships with families, and responsiveness to children's interests and needs.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 review, there have been changes in teaching staff. Careful consideration to appoint a new centre manager has brought stability to the centre. Staff are supported by the professional service manager and the business manager. They provide ongoing professional development for teachers to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in the centre.</p><p>In 2014 ERO identified areas for development including centre leaders work with the Ministry of Education to develop an action plan to address these matters. The professional services manager, centre manager and teachers have made some good progress, although several areas continue to be a focus for improvement. Teachers have sustained positive practices in relation to the nurturing care of infants, and their supportive interactions encourage older children to develop independence.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a sense of belonging and they develop positive relationships with teachers and other children in the centre. They participate enthusiastically with activities and resources that teachers provide. Children like to help with centre routines alongside teachers who ask good questions to prompt children about their choices.</p><p>Infants and toddlers show trust in caring adults who are responsive to their individual needs and interests. They enjoy opportunities to explore suitable resources in a spacious learning environment that is welcoming to parents. Increasingly, older children are taking a lead role in their learning. They engage in active conversations with teachers and each other. The centre manager recognises that older children now need to experience more complex play and opportunities for exploration and problem solving.</p><p>Teachers use a variety of ways to access whānau aspirations and interests. Parents who spoke with ERO expressed confidence in the ways teachers provide for their children's learning. They appreciate the way that information is shared, including the use of an electronic portal that enables them to read and comment on their child’s learning at the centre. There are some good examples of assessment records that that show children's progress over time.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They continue to improve how planning, assessment and evaluation processes are used to enhance children’s interests and strengths. Individual plans are linked to the centre's strategic and annual planning.</p><p>Children's cultures are valued and celebrated. Teachers know children and their families well. They are aware of the importance of strengthening the bicultural programme. Teachers could increase their integration of te reo Māori me ōna tikanga in the learning programmes.</p><p>BestStart has useful systems for guiding and monitoring service operations. These include regular management meetings. The centre's strategic plan is linked to BestStart's strategic planning, philosophy statement, self-review and annual plans, and it promotes the centre's vision.</p><p>BestStart personnel keep leaders updated with current developments in early childhood education. They actively support teachers’ professional growth. A comprehensive, appraisal system is maintained, and professional development is guided by teachers' professional learning needs.</p><p>The new centre manager is inclusive in her management style and is a good role model for staff. She is committed to ongoing improvement, and is well supported by BestStart personnel. Internal evaluation is purposeful and is helping to make positive improvements in the centre. Centre leaders are committed to enhancing their internal evaluation processes and improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving evaluation to identify the impact of the programme and teaching practices on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending children's thinking through more complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing te reo Māori me ōna tikanga in learning programmes</p>
</li>
<li>monitoring and documenting how well the centre is progressing against strategic goals. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Parnell completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Parnell will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
