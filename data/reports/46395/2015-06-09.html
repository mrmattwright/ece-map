</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Butterfly Preschool is a privately owned and operated all day education and care service located in Fitzroy, New Plymouth. The centre was fully licensed by the Ministry of Education (the Ministry) in March 2015. The licence allows for 30 children, aged over two years, to attend at any one time.</p><p>The centre owner takes responsibility for managing and governing the service. She also acts as the head teacher, leading curriculum review and development. An assistant head teacher supports the head teacher with curriculum and teaching practice. The centre has five qualified early childhood teachers. Some are provisionally registered and require ongoing mentoring as they work toward full teacher registration status.</p><p>The Ministry provided Butterfly Preschool personnel with external professional learning and support throughout 2014, to develop sustainable systems and processes. These developments continue.</p><p>The centre community is multicultural. Eight children attending are MƒÅori. Fifteen are from other ethnic groups. Many are bilingual and some do not have English as a first language. For these families, learning the English language is an important aspect of the centre‚Äôs inclusive curriculum.</p><p>This is the service's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A positive tone and calm atmosphere permeate the centre. Respectful relationships between adults and children contribute positively to children‚Äôs sense of security and trust in self and others. Children participate enthusiastically in a varied range of planned and spontaneous learning experiences, including literacy and mathematics activities. The incorporation of te ao MƒÅori in the curriculum continues to evolve.</p><p>Teachers have worked collaboratively to develop the service‚Äôs philosophy. It reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The desired outcomes for children, to be independent and confident learners with social and self help skills are an integral part of their early learning experiences.</p><p>Attentive teachers support children well. They play alongside children encouraging sustained involvement. Meaningful conversations take place. Teachers question children to elicit their ideas and use prompting well to extend their language and thinking.</p><p>Assessment, curriculum planning and evaluation practices continue to evolve. The teaching team accessed external support to guide this development. Children‚Äôs individual portfolios are an attractive record of their participation in the programme. Opportunities are available for parents to express the aspirations they hold for their children and to be involved in their child‚Äôs early learning experience.</p><p>Leaders are appropriately focused on building professional practice. A positive team rapport and collaborative practices are evident. Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners. As a new centre, further developing systems for ongoing review of centre operations continues to be the priority.</p><p>Performance management for teaching staff and mentoring and coaching programmes for provisionally registered teachers are in the early stages of development and implementation. Teachers are affirmed for their good practice and professional learning. Development is sought to increase their curriculum content knowledge and skills to further improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Rationalising systems and further developing strategic and annual planning is necessary to build sustainable practice. A priority for development, to embed key systems, should focus on appraisal of teaching staff and mentoring programmes for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>Self review of the centre philosophy is ongoing. It is timely to establish curriculum priorities and emphases. Leaders should strategically plan for and further develop self review to determine the successful practices that:</p><ul>
<li>uphold MƒÅori learners‚Äô culture, language and identity more effectively through the curriculum and teaching practice</li>
<li>support progressive literacy and mathematical learning for all children.</li>
</ul><p>Developments should:</p><ul>
<li>inform relevant changes to the centre‚Äôs philosophy and curriculum expectations</li>
<li>include clear indicators for teaching and practice</li>
<li>identify measurable outcomes for evaluating success.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Butterfly Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Butterfly Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
