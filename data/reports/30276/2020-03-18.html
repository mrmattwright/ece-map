</table><p>BestStart Puketaha is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Puketaha, previously known as TopKids Puketaha, is situated in a rural setting on the north-eastern boundary of Hamilton. The centre provides all day education and care in three age-based areas. The centre is licensed for 68 children, including 15 under the age of two. The current roll of 94 includes 23 children who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy values relationships with their community of learners, developing together and aiming to provide high quality education for tamariki through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>rural learning environment - kaitiakitanga</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>open communication - mana reo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning through play - ako</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whƒÅnau involvement - whanaungatanga and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aroha for the child as an individual.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the last ERO report in 2017 a new centre manager was internally appointed and is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. Two recent internally appointed head teachers will provide support and leadership for the infant and toddler areas and preschool area respectively. There have been minimal changes to the teaching team. The centre has responded well to the key areas for development identified in the previous ERO report.</p><p>The service is operated by BestStart, a charitable organisation owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Since the last ERO review of this centre a new Chief Executive Officer has been appointed. Regional and local professional service and business managers oversee the Central North Island BestStart centres. Their vision is to work in partnership with families, whƒÅnau, teachers and communities to enable children to achieve their learning potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the BestStart organisation</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that is responsive to their interests and needs. The child-led, play-based approach supports children to direct their own learning. Children's independence and self-management skills are actively promoted. ERO observed some teachers initiating thoughtful conversations with children promoting oral language. Developing the consistency of this good practice is an important area for development for leaders. Children are viewed as competent and confident learners and experience an environment which fosters resilience and emotional and social competence.</p><p>The expansive rural outdoor environment provides many opportunities for children to connect with and grow their understanding of the natural world. Children are being supported to build their knowledge about New Zealand‚Äôs cultural heritage. Teachers are continuing to develop their confidence in the use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Children and their whƒÅnau experience a welcoming and inclusive environment. Children with additional learning and development needs are well supported through inclusive practices and personalised learning and development plans. Teachers work well with external agencies to support educational success of children. Responsive and flexible practices successfully support the transition of children into, through and beyond the centre.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from nurturing teaching interactions in a caring and calm environment. The separate area for these children allows them to freely explore, which promotes their curiosity and independence. Teachers read and respond appropriately to children‚Äôs cues. Well-established communication processes between teachers and parents support a sense of security and wellbeing for these young children.</p><p>Learning portfolios reflect children's engagement in the life of the centre and are easily accessible to children and their whƒÅnau in both hard copy and online. The recently developed individual planning process is personalising learning for all, and values parent aspirations for their child's learning. There is a need to further refine and embed this process including the presence of children‚Äôs languages, cultures and identities in assessment and planning documentation.</p><p>The newly appointed centre manager is effectively leading positive change. She has a reflective and strategic approach to her leadership, building a collaborative and respectful working environment. Teachers have access to a wide range of learning and development opportunities provided by BestStart and external providers. They are developing reflective practice through inquiry-based learning.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide centre operation. Internal evaluation is improvement focused and includes ongoing consultation with families and whƒÅnau. There is clear alignment between regional strategic direction and centre annual plans. The appraisal process assists teachers to inquire into and strengthen their practice. This process is supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Several initiatives to remove barriers to education and support children's wellness, promote equity in learning opportunities. The organisation's philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key areas for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop the centre's local curriculum. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>consulting with the parent community to develop agreed priorities for learning that reflect the philosophy and learning outcomes from <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></li>
<li>developing and implementing agreed expectations for quality teaching and learning, including assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen processes to evaluate the centre's effectiveness in promoting agreed priorities for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Puketaha Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should, strengthen the expectations and practices around the implementation of emergency drills on an, at least, three-monthly basis. <em>[HS8].</em></p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai P≈´tahi Nui</span></p><p>18 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
