</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TopKids Puketaha is situated in a rural setting on the north western boundary of Hamilton. The centre is licensed for 70 children including 24 who are up to two years old. At the time of this ERO review there were 93 children on the roll, of whom 4 identified as Māori. The centre operates in three age-banded play areas. All areas offer free-flow indoor and outdoor play as well as opportunities for children to visit other areas when they wish to do so.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been a number of staff changes. The centre manager was appointed to her position in July 2016. Many positive practices identified in the 2013 ERO report have been maintained and there has been a strong focus on addressing identified development areas. Teachers have engaged in a range of internal and external professional development opportunities to improve teaching, leadership and bicultural practices. They have also increased their knowledge and understanding of teaching children with diverse special needs. There have been improvements to the spacious playground areas for infants and toddlers, and refurbishment of some indoor areas.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed the centre's philosophy which values community relationships, shared leadership, and providing quality care and education through the centre's rural environment (kaitiakitanga), open communication (mana reo), learning through play (mana atua), whānau involvement (whanaungatanga), and aroha for the child as an individual.</p><p>TopKids Puketaha is one of over 200 education and care services operated throughout New Zealand under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Limited (BestStart), formerly known as Kidicorp (NZ) Ltd. BestStart provides strategic direction and support for the centre in establishing leadership, management and teaching practices that respect Te Tiriti o Waitangi and reflect the goals and principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood education curriculum.</p><p>BestStart employs business managers and professional service managers to monitor compliance with regulatory requirements and establish and monitor best early childhood education practices at each centre. BestStart has a strong emphasis on employing qualified and professionally capable teachers and providing professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful, responsive, interactions for learning and care. Relationships between teachers, parents and the community are positive and reciprocal. Teachers know children well and participate actively with them in play, developing language skills and sustaining engagement in self-selected activities. They extend children's thinking and interests, and engage in conversations to increase oral language skills. Te reo Māori, including waiata, karakia and kapa haka, is increasingly integrated into routines and discussions. Teachers have a responsive approach to routines and respect children’s individual preferences. Children are confident, competent self- managing learners.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively to extend children’s recognised interests. They effectively use every-day contexts such as gardening, animal care and sustainability projects to ensure that learning is meaningful and enjoyable. Opportunities to develop literacy, mathematics, science, music and creative skills are effectively woven into the programme. 'Be school ready' information is displayed demonstrating how key competencies of the national school curriculum are encouraged in each early childhood age-group. Transitions into the centre, to school, and between age-banded play areas, are sensitively managed according to the requirements of individual children and their families.</p><p>The centre's child-led programme is based on individual assessments leading to programme planning for individuals and groups with similar interests. Older children are encouraged to lead and sustain engagement in projects that have resulted in changes and enhancements to the learning environment. Parents also bring valued skills, and time to assist with the programme. Sensitive inclusion and care for children with diverse needs is evident and effective. Centre leaders and teachers maintain a strong focus on wellbeing and belonging for all children, families and staff.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation have been effectively reviewed and revised. Well-presented individual profile books are readily accessible to children and shared digitally with parents. Teachers access parent aspirations for their children through formal and informal conversations and digital feedback. This enhances the seamlessness of the home-centre partnership by enabling parents and whānau to immediately comment on children’s new learning and development. Well-monitored, centre-wide expectations for assessment, planning and evaluation ensure equity of attention to children’s learning and needs. Children's learning is regularly evaluated to ensure the programme is meeting their needs.</p><p>The high quality learning environment has extensive, age-appropriate and educationally stimulating outdoor playgrounds, which have a range of flexible equipment for physical challenge, many opportunities for gardening and exploration, and maximised visibility of farm activities. Indoor play areas promote a welcoming atmosphere for children and families in each age group. Wall displays celebrate children’s families and achievements and make learning visible to children, parents and teachers. These well-considered environments effectively promote sustained group and independent play</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing, respectful interactions and adult-child attachments of their choice. Teachers respond readily to children’s cues, routines and rhythms. Children are in control of their learning. In the nursery, teachers have created a calm and uncluttered environment</p><p>with age-appropriate furniture and readily accessed equipment. Very spacious designated outdoor play areas provides natural shade, a wide range of outdoor play experiences and visibility between age groups. Teachers maintain regular contact with parents/caregivers about children’s immediate learning and care needs. Very young children are confident explorers. They are encouraged and inspired by responsive teaching practice.</p><p>The centre manager has a strong focus on building collaborative team and community relationships. She has worked with the team and community to develop and implement a clear vision for the centre. Curriculum decisions reflect the centre's philosophy, strengths and values. Teachers’ personal strengths are utilised for the benefit of all. Self review has followed BestStart's process and is leading to ongoing improvement. Useful management systems promote reflective practice about curriculum development leading to positive outcome for children.</p><p>BestStart provides strong direction and guidance for centre leaders and staff. BestStart personnel have undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal, which is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers’ reflections about their practice. BestStart emphasises the importance of identifying priority learners and has made teaching as inquiry a requirement for all staff. It uses regular surveys to receive feedback about systems and professional support. The business manager and professional services manager give helpful advice through formal and informal reviews of this centre. They effectively communicate and model a commitment to developing and sustaining high quality practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and managers agree that there is a need to review how well children’s assessment profiles reflect the continuing development of early literacy and mathematics skills along with cultural and family heritages.</p><p>Children's comments are beginning to feature in planning-wall captions and digital assessments. A next step is to consider how children's perspectives about their learning and development can be captured and recorded to provide further influence in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Puketaha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Puketaha will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>23 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
