</table><p>While many office holders are new to management roles, their collective commitment and support for each other, coupled with ongoing assistance from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), positions this service well to improve and sustain good practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions about the education programme, property and equipment.</p><p>A¬†kaitautoko, centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association‚Äôs structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs five mixed-age sessions per week. It is purpose-built for early childhood education and situated adjacent to a primary school. Relationships between families are often continued from playcentre through to school. This has resulted in the development of a strong sense of community. The philosophy emphasises the importance of child-centred, play-based education that is inclusive of families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>After a fall in the roll in 2012, there has been an influx of new members. With this there has been a strong and successful focus on gaining commitment to training. A relatively high number have now attained Course 2 (Te¬†Puna) and 3 (Te Manga) certificates. Members are proud of the fact that a paid supervisor is now required for only one session a week. Most children attending are aged three years and under. An ongoing challenge is retaining children to school age.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. It has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is strongly reflected in members‚Äô practice. Their inclusive and well-considered approach welcomes new families and provides good support for a diverse range of learning needs. The programme is child led. Routines are gently implemented to give children time and opportunities to make their own choices. Adults are consistently respectful and responsive. A positive, purposeful tone is evident.</p><p>The programme supports children's independence and confidence as learners effectively. Music is a particular strength at present. This has evolved from children's emerging talents and ideas, and adults‚Äô willingness to respond collectively. Parents initiate and sustain learning conversations. These promote children‚Äôs oral language learning and communication. Individual education plans and resources are developed by the centre to support the inclusion of those with special learning needs. Infants and toddlers are considered competent learners. They are keen participants in daily sessions. Children are generally cooperative, friendly and settled. Many sustain their interest and engagement in play for long periods of time.</p><p>Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials. These are well organised and freely available for children. There is sufficient room for children to explore, and investigate materials without interruption from others. The outdoor area provides good support for physically active play and different age groups and skill levels. Children display a strong sense of belonging and ownership of their playcentre environment. Members agree that further development of displays is needed to support children‚Äôs reflection on their learning, and to better represent the cultural diversity of the local community. Provision for science has also been identified for improvement.</p><p>A MƒÅori perspective is evident in the centre environment and programme. Children use karakia and waiata as part of their regular routine. Members express commitment to ongoing development of this aspect of their practice.</p><p>Parents continue to work on their approach to supporting children‚Äôs learning. Ongoing review and updates to the planning process, along with guidance from the kaitautoko, are resulting in better understanding about children‚Äôs learning. A more effective and collective approach to planning the programme is developing. Profile books are becoming valued records of children‚Äôs participation and learning. Termly and daily discussions enable everyone to share information about individuals and plan for further sessions.</p><p>The friendly, supportive culture and well-developed communication foster parents‚Äô confidence and willingness to become involved in management roles and training. A shared approach to leadership has been successfully used with a team now collectively managing operations. The strong commitment of the current core group of parents should lead to a positive future for this service.</p><p>Members are developing their understanding of the purpose and use of self review. They have started to use the association‚Äòs tools and frameworks to support reflection on their practice. Regular and purposeful discussions about the programme and operation are promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focussed on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. This centre is beginning to make good use of association systems and processes to ensure legislative requirements are met, good practice is sustained and improvement is promoted.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members agree that further development is needed to strengthen key aspects of their practice. Particular attention should be given to the following areas.</p><div>
<ul>
<li>Assessment, planning and evaluation by:
<ul>
<li>continuing to develop understanding of children‚Äôs learning linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early curriculum and Playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>in consultation with their parents, giving priority to identifying and highlighting individual children‚Äôs significant learning and learning needs in profile books, session evaluations and planning</li>
<li>identifying next learning steps linked to these special moments</li>
<li>showing progressions of learning for individuals</li>
<li>revisiting termly plans to ascertain the progress children have made and to support decisions about next steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Building shared understanding and use of self review. Support to use association frameworks and to understand those that build quality is a next step.</li>
</ul>
</div><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waterloo Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waterloo Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
