</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p class="TableParagraph">Grace Community Preschool opened in 2013 and was previously known as the Dream Centre Christian Preschool. It is adjacent to the Grace Community Church and provides full day education and care for children over two years of age. The Christian ethos is an integral part of the philosophy and centre operations.</p><p class="TableParagraph">The centre serves a multicultural community in New Lynn with diverse languages and cultures. Many of the children are transported to and from the centre in a van.</p><p>The centre is one of four owned by the Manukau Christian Charitable Trust. The Trust employs a general manager to oversee preschool operations and an education advisor to oversee curriculum and provide support. The centre offers an optional programme ‘Rainbow Riders’ for children up to six. Children in this programme spend much of their day in a separate room.</p><p>Since the centre opened there has been significant roll growth and changes to teaching staff. Most staff are qualified teachers. Centre managers have made improvements to the environment and have plans in place to improve the outdoor play area.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, actively engage in play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. They show a strong sense of belonging and are developing a sense of themselves as capable, caring learners. They respond well to teacher’s expectations and have opportunities to make choices about their play.</p><p>Respectful and caring relationships underpin the centre’s inclusive tone. Centre leaders and staff value parent and community involvement. There is a relaxed atmosphere and teachers are attentive and responsive to children’s ideas, needs and preferences. Parents/whānau receive good information about their children's learning and are encouraged to take an active part in the centre programme and events.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They listen carefully to children and encourage them to talk about their ideas. Some teachers talk with children in their home language. They provide very good support for children to maintain their first language and increase their English language. Teachers support children to develop their physical skills and they nurture their creativity and imagination.</p><p>Teachers provide a well-resourced, carefully organised environment that reflects the centre values, children’s involvement and Māori as tangata whenua. Centre leaders are keen to further develop their bicultural practices and to strengthen child-led assessment and planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>The Christian philosophy of the centre and the growing influence of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guide the programme for children. Early science, literacy and mathematics concepts are also encouraged though play and planned activities.</p><p>Child-focused centre operations are guided by a clear vision, the recently reviewed philosophy, and sound accountability practices. Teachers’ professional capabilities and leadership are fostered through mentoring and ongoing professional development. Centre leaders have a strong commitment to providing a good quality service, including developing a culture of teacher reflection and ongoing improvement. They recognise that self review could be more evaluative and collaborative.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing teachers' understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and their responsiveness to child-initiated learning</li>
<li>reviewing how well teaching practices promote Māori language, culture and identity</li>
<li>extending the level of challenge in children’s learning and play</li>
<li>reviewing how well the ‘Rainbow Riders’ programme aligns with the centre’s philosophy, and <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that external professional development would assist the centre to:</p><ul>
<li>develop robust self review that involves teachers, parents and children, and focuses on improving children's educational opportunities and outcomes</li>
<li>develop assessment and planning processes that show how teachers notice, respond to and build on children’s individual interests over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grace Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the service could develop more robust appraisal processes aligned to the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em> and teachers’ job descriptions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Grace Community Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
