</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puddleducks‚Äô Nursery and Preschool (PN) is one of three privately owned centres operating under Aspiring Services Ltd. The service is situated in Palmerston North. The Nursery and Preschool had separate licences when ERO last reviewed the service in 2014. They are now on one licence to provide all day education and care, five days a week for 82 children, including 28 up to the age of two years at any one time. A mid-day meal is provided.</p><p>A board of directors and an advisory board undertake the governance role. In June 2017, significant changes were made at the governance and management level at the Aspiring Service's centres. A managing director and educational leader have responsibility for overseeing strategic operation and professional practice in all three centres. Each centre has a professional leader and team leaders.</p><p>In this service, the professional leader is not part of the teaching ratio and oversees curriculum delivery, professional practice and the day-to-day operation of the service. Of the 17 teachers employed, nine have current practising certificates with the Education Council of Aotearoa.</p><p>The physical learning environment is organised into distinct spaces for infants, toddlers and children aged over 30 months to five years. Each group has its own teaching team and team leader.</p><p>At the time of this ERO evaluation, an internal evaluation of the service philosophy is underway. This is a collaborative exercise involving staff, families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews of Aspiring Services Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning and holistic development is encouraged through a range of planned and spontaneous learning experiences. Desired outcomes for children and curriculum development align well with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are building their collective curriculum knowledge through the internal professional learning taking place.</p><p>A positive tone and inclusive practice permeates the service. The youngest children attending are nurtured within a culture of care by attentive key caregivers. Practice for transitioning children into, between and from the centre's learning spaces is flexible and responsive to each child's and family's needs. Children identified with additional learning needs are well catered for.</p><p>Teachers know children's interests, preferences and needs well. Assessment practice enables teachers to deliberately promote and progress children's learning. Policies and procedures to guide effective teaching have not been reviewed for some time. Although there are strategies in place to support teachers to achieve a consistent standard of assessment practice, quality is variable.</p><p>Effective strategies are in place to involve parents and whƒÅnau in their child's education. They regularly receive information about their child's learning and development and can actively engage in the life of the centre.</p><p>A strategic aim to build capacity and teachers' capability to provide a culturally responsive curriculum is supported through internal professional development and learning. Te ao MƒÅori is an integral part of all children's daily experiences. Responding to and reflecting each child's culture, language and identity in the curriculum and assessment practice are ongoing developments.</p><p>Systems and processes related to governance and management have not been rigorously implemented. Management and governance are beginning to address through the recent appointment of a managing director and operations manager.</p><p>Managers and leaders continue to build their knowledge to lead effective internal evaluation and support teachers' ongoing professional growth. Leaders and teachers are highly reflective practitioners who work collaboratively to continually improve teaching practice and learning outcomes for children. There are examples, across the Aspiring Services centres, where planned internal evaluation and appraisal practice is very well led. Managers and leaders need to identify these pockets of good practice, determine the processes and practices that are working well and support all teams and teachers, across the three services, to achieve a consistently high standard of practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Governance, managers and leaders need to improve strategic and annual planning to be assured of the effective operation of the service; that the dual purposes of internal evaluation for improvement and accountability are well understood; and that policies and procedures are rigorously implemented.</p><p>Priorities for development are in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing documents to guide curriculum implementation and teaching practice, with a deliberate focus on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building managers', leaders' and teachers capability through consistent rigorous appraisal practice responsive to the needs and goals of individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build effective internal evaluation and consistency of practice across all the Aspiring Services.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puddleducks' Nursery and Preschool (PN) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice managers need to ensure policies and procedures for personnel management are fit for purpose and well implemented.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puddleducks' Nursery and Preschool (PN) will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>30 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
