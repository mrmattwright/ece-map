</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Aroha Noa in Palmerston North¬†provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age.¬†Of the 79 children enrolled, 52 are MƒÅori.</p><p>The service was relicensed in 2014 bringing two buildings under one license. Te Aroha Noa is now made up of two parts: the new centre, He Ngakau Matua, a teen parent unit catering for 10 children aged up to 2 years; and, He Ngakau WhƒÅnau which caters for children from birth to five years old.</p><p>The centre is one branch of the Te Aroha Noa Community Services Trust(the Trust),¬†an integrated community development agency committed to empowering the community to identify its own needs, resources and solutions. The centre kaupapa/philosophy is underpinned by the core values of the Trust. Managers and educators provide parents with a range of opportunities to learn alongside their children.</p><p>Since the November 2011 ERO¬†report,¬†the centre has had a leadership change. A new centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the service and for leading teaching and learning.</p><p>Positive aspects of practice identified in the¬†previous¬†2011 ERO report continue to be evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a bicultural curriculum that encourages learning through play.</p><p>MƒÅori ways of knowing, doing and being are based on: whƒÅnau tangata, parents acknowledged as the first teachers; manaakitanga, ensuring the prestige of the individual remains intact; ngƒÅ hononga, respectful relationships; and kotahitanga, recognising the child as a holistic learner.</p><p>Teachers model and integrate te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori across the centre. Children confidently participate in rituals and routines, contributing in karakia and responding to te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>The child-led programme is based on the principles and strands of,<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>¬†the early childhood curriculum.¬†These guide relationships, interactions and children‚Äôs experiences.¬†He Ngakau Matua implements a whƒÅnau-based approach to attachment and care, and promotes a primary caregiving model.¬†</p><p>Children engage enthusiastically and enjoy a calm and settled learning environment. An emphasis on literacy and mathematics is evident. The curriculum is highly responsive to learners‚Äô culture, identity and language.¬†Children‚Äôs strengths, interests and needs are supported.</p><p>Planning, evaluation and assessments are documented in learning journals. These celebrate children‚Äôs progressions and highlights, and include parent and whƒÅnau voice. ERO encourages the centre to continue to develop the newly introduced planning, assessment and evaluation process.</p><p>Te Aroha Noa manages and facilitates appropriate training for teaching of¬†children with complex needs. A close working relationship with outside agencies is in place. A strong centre advocacy approach is enacted.</p><p>Governors and leaders effectively establish partnerships for learning and supporting children. Policies and procedures are comprehensive, detailed and regularly reviewed to promote children‚Äôs wellbeing, and physical and emotional safety.</p><p>Self review informs decision-making to promote quality education and care for children. This is especially apparent in supporting MƒÅori children's success as MƒÅori.</p><p>Leaders are effective in building capability within the service to promote positive learning outcomes for all children. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening distributed¬†leadership</li>
<li>centre-wide professional development to ensure consistency of practices and processes</li>
<li>increased cultural responsiveness¬†of teachers</li>
<li>leadership strongly linked to self review, vision and strategic direction.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and ERO agree that staff induction processes require further development.</p><p>Partnerships with families, whƒÅnau, community and iwi are based on reciprocal, respectful relationships. Children experience close links between the centre and the home. There is high participation and involvement by parents and family.</p><p>A programme is specifically designed to support parents and children¬†transition to schools, especially priority learners as they approach primary school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers identify that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>align the appraisal process for all centre staff</li>
<li>further develop te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>strengthen partnerships with Pacific families</li>
<li>continue support for parent educators</li>
<li>further review the philosophy.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Aroha Noa Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Aroha Noa Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>14 October 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
