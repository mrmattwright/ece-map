</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blessings for Life is a new service providing full day care and education in a home-like environment for up to 20 children. The centre largely provides for children over two years old but also caters for a small group of infants and toddlers. The owner opened the centre in November 2011 with staff who are close family members and share Christian beliefs. As a result strong features of the service are the family atmosphere, a low key approach to routines and programmes underpinned by Christian values.</p><p>Staff have engaged in first aid training but have not yet established professional development programmes. Most of the staff are registered early childhood teachers who have a strong interest in the community and in establishing learning partnerships with families. Almost half the centre roll is MƒÅori and teachers are committed to supporting these children to succeed as MƒÅori.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Blessings for Life.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is a warm and welcoming environment for children and their families. Children settle happily, quickly make choices about play and activities of interest and interact confidently with adults. They are relaxed and engage enthusiastically with their friends. Children participate well in mat-time activities and planned project work. Infants and toddlers explore independently and receive affectionate care within the whole group.</p><p>MƒÅori children are specifically supported through the use of waiata, karakia and some MƒÅori-themed resources. They are also learning to recite their mihi. Teachers are developing their integration of te reo MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>Teachers support children's involvement in the programme well. They consistently work alongside children engaging them in conversations that encourage children to share their own ideas. Teachers expect children to develop as independent learners with respect for the environment and each other. Positive guidance, trusting relationships and affirming interactions characterise teachers‚Äô work with children.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes in response to the interests of individual children and the group. They plan associated activities and resources to provide a variety of learning experiences. Teachers incorporate science learning well and make very good use of the outdoor environment and community resources. They thoughtfully evaluate the effects of their programmes and record children's learning in attractive assessment portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are keen to support children's transition to school and provide some specific early literacy and numeracy tasks as part of this commitment. It is important that the emphasis is on children learning literacy and numeracy in more playful contexts rather than in formal literacy activities. As they continue to develop the centre curriculum, teachers could increase their focus on children up to two years old. While these children are warmly nurtured, they would benefit from a deliberate emphasis on toddlers‚Äô play and development in the programme plan.</p><p>Parents and families are welcomed partners in the centre. They are well informed about activities, invited to share information about their children and encouraged to be involved in their child‚Äôs learning. The owner and teachers respect and value the diversity of their community and are responsive to different family needs. They are developing strategies to further involve families in planning and self-review processes.</p><p>The owner has made good progress in establishing centre management and administration systems. The family nature of the business has resulted in suitable low key practices that are supported by an appropriate range of policies and procedures. The owner has developed a long-term strategic plan that informs her annual planning. She recognises she could now strengthen this framework to align better with early childhood regulations. The establishment of professional development programmes for all staff would enhance these strategies for improvement. In keeping with the early stage of the centre‚Äôs development, documentation of self review is just beginning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and ERO agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning and assessment to more clearly identify teachers‚Äô roles in extending children's learning</li>
<li>developing goals to further promote the success of MƒÅori children, including increasing the use of te reo MƒÅori in the programme</li>
<li>promptly implementing personnel policies, including the staff appraisal process</li>
<li>becoming more rigorous in the documentation of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blessings for Life completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the owner should review practices related to centre excursions to clarify strategies for risk management and to improve adult to child ratios for beach trips.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blessings for Life will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
