</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Crawshaw Kindergarten is located in Hamilton and provides sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 51 children were enrolled, of whom 19 are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, &lsquo;Every child reaching their full potential&rsquo;. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All WKA kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschools</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten&rsquo;s quality of education. A kaum&#257;tua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about M&#257;ori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten&rsquo;s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the last ERO review teachers have strengthened their approaches to self review, and focus on maintaining and raising the quality of education and care for children. Teachers have a shared understanding of learning and teaching expectations and they make better use of parent and wh&#257;nau views and take into account the aspirations they have for their children. The centre aims to provide an inclusive programme where children feel safe, relate positively to others, have fun and develop self-managing skills as capable independent learners.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Crawshaw Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children experience high-quality education and care at the kindergarten. They benefit from the warm and respectful relationships that they experience with one another and with adults. Teachers promote and have established a welcoming environment for children and their families and wh&#257;nau. There are many opportunities for children to develop friendships and social skills in their communication with others. Children are encouraged to take responsibility for their well-being, self management and to be aware and look out for others.</p><p>Children experience an extensive variety of learning opportunities, both indoors and outdoors. Teachers promote a rich curriculum based on children&rsquo;s interests and developmental needs in a high-quality learning environment that motivates and challenges children to explore, research and inquire. Outstanding features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>high-quality teaching interactions that builds on children&rsquo;s knowledge, and skills for learning and behaviour</li>
<li>opportunities and conversations that promote meaningful literacy and mathematical experiences</li>
<li>a focus on sustainability and learning about respecting and caring for the environment, nature and people</li>
<li>opportunities to experience creative arts, music, drama, science and physical activity.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers weave te ao M&#257;ori processes into the daily programme. Manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are strongly evident in daily practice and these concepts underpin the kindergarten&rsquo;s culture. The availability of resources, inclusion of tikanga, waiata and te reo M&#257;ori promote a strong sense of belonging for M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau. An understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage is also provided for all children.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for children and work in partnership with families and wh&#257;nau. They implement an inclusive programme where diversity is valued and celebrated. Parents feel welcome to stay and contribute frequently to the interests and learning of their children.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning and provide a valuable response in the learning portfolios. Ideas are included in the planning of the emergent curriculum. Portfolios celebrate individual children&rsquo;s success and progress in learning. Teachers are focused on enhancing the quality of the learning partnership they have with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The head teacher is providing sound professional leadership. Teachers respond effectively and work collegially to achieve positive learning outcomes for all children. They are well supported by an experienced ESM from the association. Together this teaching and leadership team keep up-to-date with current best practices in early childhood education and care.</p><p>All aspects of self review about the centre operations and learning programmes are highly effective. Teachers are frequently reflecting about practice and making ongoing improvements to the kindergarten environment. This approach is effective in keeping the centre focused on what is best for children&rsquo;s learning and care.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>ERO supports teachers&rsquo; intention to further investigate through a research-based, inquiry approach to self review the place and contribution of parents in the learning partnership of their children in the kindergarten. The self review programme should also identify learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Crawshaw Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Crawshaw Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>6 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
