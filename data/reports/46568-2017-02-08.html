</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manaia View Kindergarten is situated in the grounds of Manaia View School in Whangarei. It operates in two refurbished classrooms and a spacious playground shaded by boundary trees. The kindergarten has been open for over two years and attracts whānau from the surrounding area. The children are predominantly from Māori backgrounds, with many whānau groups attending.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for 30 children between the ages of two and five years. It operates a Kindergarten Day Model where children are able to attend sessions similar to school hours. Not all children attend the full day or the full week.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy was developed by teachers. It includes reference to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the importance of respectful and valued partnerships with whānau. The philosophy also places emphasis on encouraging children's holistic development and their passion for life-long learning. These elements are evident in practice.</p><p>The kindergarten has a new team of teachers. The head teacher is supporting the development of trusting relationships with whānau, and embedding shared understandings and a focus on quality provision for children.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA), which provides governance and management frameworks to support kindergarten operations. All teachers are qualified and share the leadership of kindergarten operations.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive the attention, affirmation and aroha that allows them to be confident and capable in the kindergarten. The mix of ages and strong familial ties generate tuakana/teina relationships and opportunities for children to take leadership and caring roles. Routines and rituals for the day help children to understand expectations and enjoy social time together. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and ownership in the centre.</p><p>Teachers have developed trusting partnerships with whānau based on sharing knowledge and information, and welcoming participation in the programme. An aim of the teachers has been to share the value they place on education and care for these children with their whānau. Teachers measure their success by the support and enthusiasm whānau have for contributing to, and being part of the kindergarten and events such as Matariki and school visits.</p><p>Teachers clearly focus the curriculum on the needs of the children to gain social competence, vocabulary, emotional intelligence and independence. Children's learning through play is a priority and teachers work closely with children to support their integration and collaboration. The wealth of activity options available enables children to make choices and explore.</p><p>Children's understanding and care for each other is a result of teachers' calm management of children's behaviour. This, together with teachers' recognition of children's coping strategies, tolerance levels and ability to manage relationships effectively, helps to create a positive social environment. Teachers' understanding of children and their whānau is well supported by the head teacher's experience, passion and commitment to this community.</p><p>Children's assessment portfolios include clear evidence of teachers' professional knowledge and an emphasis on supporting children's language and cultures, and links to <em>Te Whāriki.</em> Learning stories clearly show children's participation and dispositions as learners. Regular consultation with whānau about their aspirations for their children are recorded and used to support programme planning. Teachers' detailed self review has helped to guide curriculum developments in the indoor and outdoor learning areas</p><p>Children have opportunities to work at their own pace, develop their play and enjoy conversations with others and adults. The environment, split between two rooms, creates some supervision difficulties for teachers. However, the environment is carefully prepared and the use of the deck invites children's play and creativity. Natural resources support children's games and there are good prompts for children to engage in activities that promote early literacy, mathematics and science investigations. There are opportunities for children to be challenged and take 'safe' risks in their play.</p><p>Teachers manage children's transitions into and through the kindergarten with care. Transitions to school are eased by the proximity of the school and the involvement of kindergarten children in school activities. Teachers have developed sound relationships with new entrant teachers.</p><p>Teachers hold fast to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Teachers use te reo Māori with children throughout the day, and te reo is evident in written notices, portfolios and signs. Whānau recognise teachers' commitment and express their willingness to participate in programmes.</p><p>The Association's governance practices are effective. Its long-term direction continues to focus on continually improving learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><p>very good support and guidance by Association personnel, especially in the development of culturally responsive practices and the integration of te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful for children</p><ul>
<li>
<p>new teacher appraisal systems, and professional learning that focuses more closely on improving team skills, knowledge and practice and more distributed leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular head teacher meetings that provide opportunities for collegial discussion and support.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and the Association professional practice manager agree that key next steps should include continuing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the focus on developing shared processes for assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to develop shared understandings and approaches through philosophy review and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to embed teachers' sense of ownership and belonging and creating lines of responsibility to strengthen sustainability</p>
</li>
</ul><p>the focus on strengthening children's respect for the environment, each other and kaiako.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manaia View Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manaia View Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
