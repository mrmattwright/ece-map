</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Kidstart Childcare - Otara Early Learning Centre is licensed to provide education and care for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Most children have Pacific heritage with the largest groups being Samoan, Tongan and Cook Island MƒÅori. Parents enrol their children for full days or for sessions.</p><p>The centre operates under the Barnardos organisation which provides child and family services in communities around New Zealand. Barnardos provides a framework of policies and systems for the centre. The organisation manages the centre administration and personnel through a service manager, while practice leaders support teachers to develop their teaching practice.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on empowering children by recognising their culture, language, individual experiences and prior knowledge. Teachers promote independence, responsibility and self management skills as they work with children.</p><p>Children up to two years are cared for in a designated area within the attractive, purpose-built centre. There are some opportunities for older children and siblings to join the younger children during the day. Towards the end of each day, children play together as a mixed age group.</p><p>There have been significant staff changes in recent years. Most teachers are recently registered and beginning their careers in early childhood education. The experienced head teacher, practice leaders and mentor teachers from the wider organisation support teachers to achieve full registration and to extend their teaching practice.</p><p>The centre operates in the grounds of a neighbourhood school complex. A strong relationship has been established with the school. Most children from the centre will transition to this school in the future.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report was the first for the centre under the name Barnardos Early Learning Centre ‚Äì Otara. Areas of good practice noted in the 2012 report included positive relationships between teachers, children and with aiga and whƒÅnau, and programmes based on children‚Äôs interests. Self review, the quality of teaching and learning interactions between adults and children and the provision for older children were identified as areas for development. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a good sense of belonging in the centre. They are settled and engaged in their play and with each other. Children know the routines of the day and willingly participate in the programme.</p><p>Infants are cared for in a small group. They explore their environment freely and toddlers self select their play. Teachers are responsive to parents‚Äô preferences for the care of their child. Children are seen as capable and are supported to become independent. Teachers care for and nurture children appropriately.</p><p>Teachers collaborate to plan programmes and promote positive outcomes for children. They notice children‚Äôs interests during their play and record children‚Äôs involvement in the programme and their learning through useful learning stories. They plan programmes that are likely to promote children‚Äôs learning through these interests.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have established strong partnerships with whƒÅnau and aiga. They provide good opportunities for parents to find out more about effective parenting and child development. Parents spoken to by ERO reported the positive influence workshops have had on their knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Positive relationships are evident between children and teachers. Some teachers speak the home languages of children and use this to good effect to help new children and their whƒÅnau/aiga to settle into the centre.</p><p>Children freely choose and direct their own play. They have good access to a suitable range of resources in the indoor environment. Teachers support children well as they play. ERO agrees with centre leaders that the planned upgrade of the outdoor area and resources is necessary to further challenge older children, particularly boys, to explore and to learn.</p><p>The cultures of children who attend the centre are highly visible in the environment. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori incidentally during the day. Tikanga is well supported by people in the community with relevant expertise. Children are affirmed in their language, culture and identity.</p><p>The head teacher, who has been appointed since the 2012 ERO report, provides good leadership for the centre. She works actively with children and leads curriculum planning and implementation for the centre. She collaborates well with the practice leaders to guide and support teachers as they progress towards full teacher registration. Self-review processes are established and focus well on centre priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to sustain improvements and to further build the quality of the care and provision for children, centre managers and ERO agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue building capacity with self review to promote ongoing improvements</li>
<li>develop shared expectations for teacher practice to promote the centre‚Äôs philosophy</li>
<li>continue supporting teachers to achieve full registration and to strengthen their practice</li>
<li>consider ways to inform parents of children under two years about their children‚Äôs day</li>
<li>find ways to include parent aspirations into planning and parent voice into assessment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Otara Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, centre managers should review risk assessment management for excursions from the centre.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Otara Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
