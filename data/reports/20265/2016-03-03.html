</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Mt Albert Research Centre (MARC) Early Learning Centre was established 25 years ago. It continues to provide education and care for children, the majority of whose parents work at the research centre. The grounds and buildings have been recently extended and it is now licensed for up to 60 children, including 30 up to two years of age. The centre occupies a large remodelled house situated in the grounds of the Plant and Food, and Environmental Science Research centres.</p><p>An executive committee oversees the service's operations. Daily management of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher, who is supported by six qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes tuakana/teina relationships and encourages children to develop physical and emotional independence through caring for themselves and others. The centre values opportunities for children to be involved in real world learning.</p><p>The centre has made some progress in responding to the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. Staff are continuing to work towards promoting positive outcomes for children within a centre that focuses on the importance of play.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled at the centre and are encouraged to be confident and independent learners. They enjoy learning together with their peers in a peaceful, homelike environment. There is an emphasis on children learning at their own pace and having good opportunities for physical challenges, imaginative play and forming friendships.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and children learn within a mixed age setting. Babies and toddlers have a separate space where they can play and are also able to move freely throughout the centre. They have opportunities to play alongside older children and to experience all the challenges that the outdoor environment offers.</p><p>Teachers have recently undertaken a review of the learning environment and the role of the teacher in facilitating children's learning. They are respectful and inclusive of the diverse cultures and needs of the children attending the centre. Teachers are aware of the importance of weaving literacy and numeracy naturally throughout the programme. ERO supports this as a continued focus for the centre.</p><p>Teachers are currently involved in reviewing programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Professional discussions and research have underpinned the introduction of a new electronic system to record children's learning and progress. Teachers are still seeking ways to revisit children's learning through this new system.</p><p>The centre has a commitment to ongoing improvement. Self-review systems are well understood and continue to be strengthened. Teacher appraisals are aligned to the <em>Practising Teachers' Criteria</em>. It is now timely for teachers to align the centre's appraisal process to the Ministry of Education resource <em>TƒÅtaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners.</em> This would help to underpin and strengthen bicultural practice within the centre.</p><p>The centre is thoughtfully governed and managed. Careful management of resources, a policy framework which is reviewed, and a documented strategic direction support centre operations and development. An annual plan guides centre practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, teachers and ERO agree that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a process to document programme planning, assessment and evaluation in order to foster a deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, across all areas of the programme</li>
<li>continuing to review centre resources to reflect bicultural perspectives and the cultures of children</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen and align strategic and annual plans and appraisal and self review processes in order to deepen teachers' evaluative thinking and assist them to implement related action plans.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of MARC Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of MARC Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
