</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Young Explorers Early Learning Centre is a privately owned education and care service based in the Buckland area on the outskirts of Pukekohe. The centre is licensed for 40 children, including 10 under the age of two years. It operates in two age-based rooms. The roll of 49 includes nine MƒÅori children. The centre owner is also the centre manager and provides professional leadership for teachers. Since the previous ERO review in 2015, centre leadership has remained the same and there have been some changes in the teaching team.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia (RIE) inspired philosophy makes a commitment to teachers working alongside children, facilitating their learning, provoking their curiosity and developing their capacity to make meaning of the world around them.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy participating in a programme that strongly reflects the centre philosophy. The programme is primarily child-initiated with specific teacher-led projects and set meal times. Particular strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the project approach that provokes children‚Äôs curiosity and supports their thinking</li>
<li>a primary caregiver system that underpins children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging</li>
<li>children's ready access to high-quality resources and equipment</li>
<li>well-managed transitions into the centre, between the two age-based rooms and on to school.</li>
</ul><p>Children's learning is enhanced by frequent excursions into the wider community. Older children also participate in a weekly excursion that provides opportunities for them to extend their problem solving skills and experience safe physical challenge. Well-presented individual profiles, that are also available electronically, reflect children's participation in the programme. These capture children's emerging interests and learning. They support teachers planning to extend children‚Äôs play and their learning.</p><p>Children under the age of two years enjoy caring and nurturing relationships with their teachers. They play and learn in a calm and settled environment. Young children's care needs are well met by teachers who are responsive to supporting home routines.</p><p>The centre has an inclusive approach to supporting children with additional needs. The centre manager and teachers access appropriate external expertise and work in partnership with parents to support positive outcomes for these children.</p><p>MƒÅori children‚Äôs language, culture and identity is acknowledged and celebrated through the use of waiata, karakia, access to natural resources and celebration of events such as Matariki. Teachers implement appropriate tikanga MƒÅori practices when interacting with children and whƒÅnau. An important next step for the centre is to build teachers' confidence and capability in using te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children and including te ao MƒÅori in the centre environment.</p><p>Teachers work collegially in the best interests of children. They are committed to the centre philosophy. A special feature of the centre is the positive and affirming relationship that teachers have with children and their families. Teachers use a wide range of effective strategies that promote children‚Äôs problem solving and thinking skills. They participate alongside children in meaningful play. Teachers effectively promote children‚Äôs oral language, literacy, mathematics and science knowledge and skills through the project approach and children's self-initiated play.</p><p>Professional leadership of the centre is well-informed. The centre manager is committed to providing a high-quality service through the provision of low child-to-teacher ratios and maintaining a high proportion of qualified staff. A shared leadership model provides opportunities for teachers to share their knowledge and expertise among the team. Teachers receive regular feedback about their practice and generous funding for their professional learning and development. An appropriate policy framework has been developed to guide centre operations. Useful self-review processes, linked to the centre's philosophy, contribute to ongoing improvement. Self-review could be further strengthened by aligning it more clearly to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre manager and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>consult with parents to develop a local curriculum that reflects parent aspirations for their children and the expectations of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></li>
<li>further develop bicultural practices by</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="display: inline !important;">increasing teachers' capability and confidence in using te reo MƒÅori with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="display: inline !important;"></p>
reflecting te ao MƒÅori in the centre's environment</li>
<li>strengthening relationships with local marae.</li>
</ul>
</ul><div></div><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Young Explorers Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice teachers should complete an assessment and management of risks prior to all excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Young Explorers Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>21 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
