<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Rosetown Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Rosetown Preschool, located in Te Awamutu, provides education and care for children from six months to school age. It is licensed for 33 children, including up to 13 aged under two. At the time of this ERO review the centre had a roll of 71 of whom 20 identified as M&#257;ori. The majority of the children attend the centre on a part-time basis. The centre is privately owned and one of the owners is the centre manager. It operates two separate age-based areas for under and over two year old children.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy makes a commitment to providing a child-centred programme.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review there have been significant changes in teaching staff and there have been extensive renovations to the centre&rsquo;s buildings and outdoor play areas.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owners have a strong commitment to providing a quality service for children and their families. They generously fund the centre, including appointing additional teaching staff to ensure low child to teacher ratios. The owners are focussed on centre improvement and have established useful policies and procedures to guide and support centre operations.</p><p>The centre manager leads regular and meaningful self review that is contributing to ongoing centre development. She is committed to growing leadership capability within the teaching team and has recently appointed a team leader for the under two room.</p><p>Teachers have a shared commitment to the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. They work effectively together as a collegial team. Teachers know children and their families well. They use this knowledge to provide a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s care and learning needs. Teachers use a wide range of strategies that support children to interact together positively in both small and larger group activities. ERO observed examples of teachers who sensitively engaged alongside children in meaningful play situations. These teachers used an extensive range of strategies that effectively promote children&rsquo;s creativity, thinking and problem solving skills. A sense of belonging for M&#257;ori children is promoted through the frequent use of te reo M&#257;ori, particularly by the centre manager, and M&#257;ori signage and wall displays.</p><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that is responsive to their emerging interests and care needs. They are able to access a good range of high-quality learning resources and materials. The outdoor play areas provide children with safe physical challenge and opportunities for exploration. A feature of the programme is the frequent excursions into the community, including a close relationship with the neighbouring retirement home Te Ata. Older children undertake fortnightly visits to a local native bush area at a local farm.</p><p>Well-presented individual portfolios record children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and identify their progress and development during their time at the centre. Literacy, mathematics and music are naturally and meaningfully integrated into the programme. Well-managed group meal and mat times provide children with a sense of predictability to the day and belonging within the centre. Children in the under two room enjoy warm and nurturing relationships with their teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre owners agree that the next step for the centre is to implement a strategic approach to ongoing development including:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build leadership capability within the teaching team</li>
<li>providing centre-wide professional development for teachers to support them to consistently meet the centre owners&rsquo; expectations for quality teaching practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rosetown Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>31 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
