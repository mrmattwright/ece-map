</table><p>With significant support from Barnardos KidStart Childcare management, this service should be well placed to sustain and improve practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare-Porirua Early Learning Centre is one of 23 childcare centres owned and operated by Barnardos New Zealand, a national provider of community services for children and families. It is licensed for 25 children aged over two years. Of the 36 children enrolled, eight are MƒÅori and 23 are from Pacific ethnic groups. There is a long-established team of three registered teachers, who are supported by two part-time untrained staff. Three staff are speakers of Samoan language. Just prior to this ERO review, the head teacher resigned from her role.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of respectful relationships, parents‚Äô contribution, valuing cultural identity, and recognition of Maori as tangata whenua in supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The July 2013 ERO report identified the need for teachers to: gain a better understanding of children‚Äôs cultures; enrich the environment to reflect the diverse ethnicities of children attending; strengthen the approach to supporting MƒÅori children‚Äôs learning; strengthen appraisal, assessment processes and staff understanding and implementation of self review. Some targeted action to support teacher development was put in place through the practice leader. However, over time progress has not been sustained and teachers continue to identify most of these aspects of practice as needing further development.</p><p>Day-to-day responsibility for the management of the centre is the role of the head teacher. The regionally-based practice leader supports curriculum. An early learning manager, yet to be appointed, will have oversight of the operation of a cluster of Wellington centres, including this one. Responsibility for centre-based services is delegated to a national operations manager who reports to a general manager and the Barnardos board through the Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Since the 2012 - 2013 ERO reviews of Barnardos early learning centres, significant restructuring of the national organisation has been undertaken.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of five reviews of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Learning Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are caring and respectful in their interactions with children. They support children‚Äôs choices and at times extend their interests and ideas though initiating learning conversations. Teachers should work on strengthening the quality and their use of intentional teaching strategies. More opportunities for purposeful, well-timed engagement with individuals should also be planned for.</p><p>The programme promotes high levels of child engagement and purposeful play. Opportunities are many for creativity, exploration and collaboration with peers. The tone of sessions is characterised by children‚Äôs joy, curiosity and eager participation. Literacy, mathematics, science, art, music and te¬†reo MƒÅori are well integrated in the context of everyday happenings. Opportunities for children to return to previously chosen play experience should be better facilitated.</p><p>The centre is suitably resourced for a range of learning activities. The outdoor area includes physically challenging equipment and is used well for creative art and tactile, open-ended activities.</p><p>Planning for learning, although carefully considered, continues to be at an early stage. Barnardos should support the team to further develop their approach and sustain any improvements they make. Next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>making learning plans more visible for children in the centre</li>
<li>strengthen the focus on individual children‚Äôs significant learning and show how their learning is intentionally extended by teachers over time</li>
<li>supporting parents to articulate the aspirations they have for their children‚Äôs learning and planning to meet these</li>
<li>increasing the visibility of families' home cultures, use of home languages and te reo MƒÅori in planning for learning.</li>
</ul><p>Inclusive practice is evident. Families‚Äô cultures are valued and positive relationships developed between staff and parents. Teachers‚Äô efforts to communicate with parents in their home languages should support them to develop a more active role in their children‚Äôs learning. A strong connection with the Samoan community is valued and sustained. Children with identified learning needs receive appropriate support. Teachers should continue to work on strengthening the integration of a bicultural perspective in the programme and practices.</p><p>A flexible approach based on the needs of children and their families, supports transitions into the service. Next development steps for supporting children‚Äôs transition to primary school should include continuing to develop ways of sharing information about their learning and early childhood practice with new-entrant teachers.</p><p>The appraisal process is not yet providing adequate support for teacher development and endorsement of satisfactory performance in meeting professional teaching requirements. Barnardos ‚ÄòGoals and Growth‚Äô system should be fully implemented. Improved appraisal and focused professional development for the head teacher and practice leader are required.</p><p>Understanding and use of internal evaluation continues to need development at centre and management level. Previous good practice has not been sustained.</p><p>Barnardos provides a range of carefully-considered operational and administrative support for the centre. This includes constructive visits and reports from the practice leader and quality assurance through the annual audit. Work is underway to strengthen the use of these tools for promoting improvements to teaching and learning.</p><p>Strategic initiatives at management level have recently been identified to support improved outcomes under the new operational framework. Identification of strategic goals and development plans at local and centre level should be a focus for management once the learning centre manager role is confirmed. Further work needs to be done to support understanding and embedding of Barnardos operational changes. Guidelines and policies, although comprehensive, continue to need updating to reflect new ways of working. In this centre, teachers‚Äô shared understanding about practice, roles and responsibilities needs strengthening. A planned approach should support the induction of the new head teacher into the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare management should provide focused professional support for teachers and leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the bicultural curriculum and te ao MƒÅori understanding</li>
<li>provide support for the new leader and continued good team work.</li>
</ul><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare management will develop an action plan for ERO that shows how it will address the key next steps to improve teaching and learning practices across this cluster of services, and include:</p><ul>
<li>developing the quality of teaching</li>
<li>implementing improvement-focused appraisal for all staff</li>
<li>ensuring quality assurance processes are consistent</li>
<li>strengthening assessment for learning practices</li>
<li>increasing the understanding and use of internal evaluation</li>
<li>improving the alignment between strategic planning at management level with centre operations.</li>
</ul><p>ERO will monitor progress made in relation to the action plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Porirua Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Porirua Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
