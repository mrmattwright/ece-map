</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiddies Campus Early Learning Centre is privately owned and operated. The centre is a two-storey house in central Dunedin. An additional outdoor area is currently being developed for children under the age of two. The owner believes in employing early childhood qualified staff. The service is open all day and children up to school age attend.</p><p>Since ERO last visited the centre in 2011 there have been staff changes. A new supervisor has been appointed and had been in the position less than four months at the time of this review. Her main priorities have been to establish relationships and become familiar with centre systems and processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>Governance and leadership</h4><p>The teachers, the children and their families are well supported by the owner/licensee. She works closely with the supervisor to manage the service. With the centre being located in the middle of the city the adults place high value on ensuring that they provide a safe environment for children.</p><p>The supervisor is a strong leader. She effectively models good practice for her team and has the support of the teachers. She has begun to identify aspects of teaching and learning that are strong and where practice can be improved. She receives regular ongoing external support as she develops in this new role.</p><h4>Key next steps</h4><p>The owner/licensee and supervisor acknowledge a need to:</p><ul>
<li>simplify and align centre processes and documentation</li>
<li>more clearly establish key priorities for the centre's future and for children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>establish reporting systems and processes to monitor progress toward achieving their key priorities</li>
<li>align self review with the centres strategic and annual plans.</li>
</ul><h4>Learning and Teaching</h4><p>Children‚Äòs learning and development is enhanced through positive, caring relationships with the teachers. The environment is inviting and welcoming. Children have access to a wide variety of good quality resources and equipment. Children work and play well together with support and encouragement from teachers. ERO observed some high quality interactions particularly in the infant room. The teachers are particularly supportive of children‚Äôs social and emotional development. They work together to ensure that every child‚Äôs learning and development is regularly noted.</p><p>Children‚Äôs group times are currently building their knowledge of MƒÅori myths and legends. Children‚Äôs enthusiasm for this learning was very evident. Their familiarity with the legends is helping children recognise aspects of these in the world around them. These experiences also mean children are becoming familiar with and using some te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers have recently focused on celebrating families‚Äô individual cultures and highlighting parents‚Äô aspirations in assessments. Parents appreciate regular communication with the teachers and the many ways they can be involved in the centre.</p><p>Teachers work well together to manage the programme and centre routines. They integrate mathematics concepts and early-literacy learning regularly. This is explicitly and effectively taught when preparing children for school.</p><h4>Key next steps</h4><p>The centre should continue to improve assessment, programme planning, and evaluation processes.</p><p>Teachers need to more clearly document in their planning, the specific strategies used to extend children‚Äôs learning and how effective these have been on extending children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>It would be helpful to develop a more useful schedule for self review. This would ensure those aspects that most impact on children, such as the philosophy, the quality of interactions and the bicultural programme are evaluated regularly.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiddies Campus Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiddies Campus Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>
