</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Curves Montessori Abberley Park is one of three centres with the same owner. The owner and an induction and mentoring manager maintain an oversight of, and provide support to, all three centres.</p><p>Learning Curves Montessori Abberley Park provides full day education and care for up to 32 children from two years old to school age. The programme at this centre incorporates Montessori approaches with Te WhƒÅriki, the Early Childhood Curriculum. This is evident in the ways the environment is presented and the resources available to children.</p><p>There have been some changes of staff and leadership since the 2014 ERO review. The owner and induction and mentoring manager undertake management and leadership responsibilities for this centre although they are not there on a daily basis. Some staff have additional administration duties. Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers and some have Montessori teaching qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three early learning centre reviews in the Learning Curves Montessori service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers regularly notice individual children's interests. They respond in appropriate ways by providing resources and access to information to extend children's ideas and skills.</p><p>Teachers recognise and consistently document individual children's learning dispositions, such as confidence and persistence. These, along with children‚Äôs participation in centre experiences, are valued as important aspects of children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are often included in centre practices and the learning environment. Children have opportunities to regularly participate in waiata and karakia.</p><p>Teachers take time to interact with parents, and discuss children's needs and daily happenings. They use this information to help them understand and respond to children in more meaningful ways.</p><p>A useful framework for internal evaluation has recently been introduced. This is supporting teachers to reflect on their practice in ways likely to lead to improved outcomes for children's learning. The implementation of this is being closely supported by the induction and mentoring manager.</p><p>The service owner is focused on outcomes for children and, along with the induction and mentoring manager, provides regular feedback focused on improving outcomes for children. Teachers receive constructive feedback through appraisal. The owner and induction and mentoring manager promote staff strengths and provide well targeted professional learning and development opportunities related to centre and staff needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Some of the priorities for improvement identified in the 2014 ERO report need further development.</p><p>The centre owner, induction and mentoring manager and ERO agree that the key next steps to strengthen the curriculum provided and improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>building emergent leadership and collective responsibility among teachers for improvement at centre level</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy to ensure it reflects this centre's shared values and beliefs</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation for teaching and learning</li>
<li>increasing teachers' understanding of internal evaluation</li>
<li>building teachers' familiarity with Te WhƒÅriki 2017 to gain a greater understanding of bicultural practices</li>
<li>further developing strategic and annual planning and evaluation to better guide overall service and centre development.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, more effective practices need to be developed so that the service owner and induction and mentoring manager can be assured that the overarching service philosophy and vision are being effectively enacted in this service.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the service has provided additional evidence to ERO to show how it has responded to the identified Key Next Steps. It is too early for ERO to evaluate the impact of these changes on improving centre practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Curves Montessori Abberley Park Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Curves Montessori Abberley Park Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>27 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
