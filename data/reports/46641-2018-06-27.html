</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Organic Kids Limited is a home-based education and care service. It is located in Parklands, Christchurch city, with educators in the Waimakariri, Selwyn and Christchurch Districts. It has a roll of 72 and provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children in small mixed-age-group settings.</p><p>The ownership and management is shared between two qualified registered teachers. They oversee service operation and provide support and guidance to the 18 home educators. All educators have qualifications, ranging from the Level 3 Certificate in Early Childhood Care and Education, through to the Bachelor of Teaching and Learning (ECE).</p><p>The service's philosophy is to provide high quality education and care through respectful, loving and consistent relationships. The service leaders believe that nature has a key role in children's learning, health and wellbeing and in promoting long-term responsibility for the environment. They make use of a Forest Education approach to learning in the environment.</p><p>The service was established in 2015. This is the first review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Organic Kids is improvement focused and committed to providing high quality education and care.</p><p>The service's philosophy, goals and systems promote positive learning outcomes for children. The strategic plan identifies five specific and worthwhile goals to support children and educators. There are effective practices in place to regularly monitor and verify the health and safety of children in educators' homes. The service leaders are committed to recruiting, managing and developing competent well-qualified home educators.</p><p>The Visiting Teachers provide high-quality support and guidance to the educators. They model best practice through regular visits, playgroups and monthly outings. They provide useful feedback to educators on their practice, and identify areas for further improvement.</p><p>Educators recognise and respond to children's interests, strengths and abilities. They offer interesting open-ended learning opportunities within the home environment and community. Educators have access to a wide range of useful professional development opportunities. They are encouraged to reflect on their own practice, and work with and support each other.</p><p>Parents are valued partners in their child‚Äôs learning. Children's engagement and participation in the programme is well documented through learning stories and the use of private social media sites. Parents are well informed. They have many opportunities to be involved in and make comments on their child's learning.</p><p>Visiting teachers and educators provide well for priority learner groups. This includes children under the age of two years, children who require additional learning support and children from different cultures.</p><p>Educators are supported to build their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. A number of staff are involved in professional learning opportunities to improve their knowledge of te reo me tikanga MƒÅori. A greater use of p≈´rakau (MƒÅori stories and legends) in teaching and learning has been identified as a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key systems to guide centre operation and practices have been established with a regular cycle of review. However some management expectations and processes related to service operations need to be more clearly documented. These include:</p><ul>
<li>expectations of what a Visiting Teacher's visit will cover</li>
<li>documentation of the process for appraisal of Visiting Teachers</li>
<li>stating the specific annual actions to be undertaken to meet the strategic goals.</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified, and leaders agree that strengthening evaluation should enable them to better know what is working, or not working, for whom and why. This includes the need to:</p><ul>
<li>be more specific about indicators of success in order to measure their evaluative questions</li>
<li>undertake ongoing monitoring of actions</li>
<li>evaluate group planning to show effective teaching strategies and next steps</li>
<li>strengthen the evaluation of programmes to enable educators and visiting teachers to identify what is contributing to effective teaching and learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>There is a need to continue supporting and developing educators' understanding and implementation of Te WhƒÅriki 2017.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Organic Kids Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified non-compliance in relation to Visiting Teachers‚Äô performance appraisal.</p><p>The service does not have an appraisal policy that details the setting of performance expectations, observations of teaching, discussion of performance with an appraiser, and the development of a performance report for Visiting Teachers. The policy needs to state the requirement for teachers to be appraised against the professional standards for teachers. Managers became aware during the onsite stage of the review that the previous appraisal process did not meet legal requirements. They have taken initial steps to remedy this for the 2018 process.</p><p>In order to address this, management must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that appraisals of staff in teaching positions are based on the current professional standards for teachers established by the Education Council for the issuing and renewal of practising teaching certificates.</li>
</ul><p>[Part 31 Education Act 1989]</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Organic Kids Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>27 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
