</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Stoddard Road is a large early childhood education centre in a light industrial area of Mt Roskill Auckland. The centre is licensed for 98 children, including 24 children up the age of two years. The centre was established by Kidicorp in 2009 and had a positive ERO review in 2011.</p><p>The centre is organised into four separate areas, including a specialised babies and toddlers area. Children over two years share equipment in the large combined outdoor space. Children nearing five years have a separate indoor area that promotes their school ready capabilities and independence.</p><p>A new centre manager has been recently appointed following a period of interim centre leadership. Kidicorp‚Äôs professional support manager (PSM) and business manager are working closely with the new manager to review centre operations. The majority of staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Strengthening leadership and building a strong team culture are identified priorities.</p><p>Staff respond positively to the wide ethnic and social diversity of children and their families. The centre provides full-day and sessional services to meet family requirements, and operates morning and afternoon transport services to assist some children in the local community to attend early childhood education.</p><p>The centre manager is consulting staff as they review the centre philosophy. Centre policies and procedures are regularly audited. In addition Kidicorp personnel evaluate the quality of the programme and provide feedback to the centre managers about areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are provided with education and care that promotes their learning, wellbeing and sense of belonging. Teachers observe children‚Äôs play and plan programmes that respond to their individual interests and dispositions. Best practices observed extended children‚Äôs engagement in play and encouraged social interaction and verbal communication.</p><p>A high number of children use English as an additional language. Play-based learning activities support children‚Äôs conversation and inquiry skills. Staff invite parents to share their cultures and languages and plan centre events to encourage family participation. Teachers could further develop their focus on language development to promote children‚Äôs‚Äô confidence and communication.</p><p>A significant number of MƒÅori and Pacific children attend the centre. A number of teachers use te reo and tikanga MƒÅori as part of their everyday practice. Learning environments reflect MƒÅori culture in attractive and purposeful ways. Centre leaders are keen to extend the bicultural understanding of staff and children through centre-wide professional learning and development.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are nurtured and well cared for. They have individual routines that respond to their home lives and parent wishes. Children with special learning needs are welcome in the centre and staff willingly adopt new ways of working to meet children‚Äôs different abilities. Children‚Äôs diverse nutritional needs are appropriately catered for by a healthy menu of baking, fruit and cooked meals.</p><p>The Kidicorp ready-for-school approach is well integrated into centre programmes. Teachers are using the environment to promote literacy and mathematics. The deliberate arrangement of displays, resources, furniture and centres of interest invite children to explore and investigate mathematical ideas and literacy concepts.</p><p>Children have respectful relationships with each other and with teachers. Many have brothers and sisters at the centre and are able to join in activities with children of mixed ages. Centre programmes allow children to sustain play with minimal interruption, and the flexible morning tea and meal time routines encourage children to become independent and self managing.</p><p>Some teachers plan deliberate activities to help children see possibilities for using resources in different and imaginative ways. These enhance the ways children engage with one another and create opportunities for collaborative play. These events encourage creativity and enable teachers to view children as capable and confident learners.</p><p>Professional practice has improved with a recent centre-wide focus on teacher planning and assessment. The introduction of an on-line approach to recording and sharing children‚Äôs learning is increasing parent involvement. Further potential in sharing these e-learning approaches with children could be explored.</p><p>Self review is becoming more inclusive and comprehensive under the leadership of the new centre manager. Sharing expectations of best practice is more central to staff meetings and discussion. Managers recognise and promote staff leadership potential. Kidicorp is currently introducing a new model of appraisal to encourage professional thinking and reflective teacher practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the next stages of centre development should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>using the new staff appraisal procedures to strengthen teachers‚Äô individual reflections about best practice and centre expectations</li>
<li>strengthening self review practices that contribute to a shared culture of ongoing improvement</li>
<li>building a centre-wide appreciation of bicultural practices that contribute to success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Stoddard completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Centre managers are aware of the need for safe access to and from the centre at arrival and collection times, and in the event of a centre evacuation. ERO is concerned that access to the centre is currently blocked by delivery trucks early in the morning. This situation poses a risk to children. Centre managers should work with staff and parents to develop a risk management plan. They should continue to negotiate with the property owner to resolve this concern.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Stoddard will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
