</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gisborne Montessori Preschool is an education and care service that provides a sessional programme and all day, and after school care for children aged two and half to five years. Since the May 2010 ERO report, the centre’s licence has been increased to cater for 72 children. A new principal and two head teachers were appointed in Term 2, 2013. At the beginning of 2013, after consultation, the afternoon session was discontinued and morning sessions reorganised to enable equitable access for all children. The environment reflects the Montessori focus on children understanding the natural world.</p><p>The preschool’s practices are based on the Montessori and the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. These aspects were evident during ERO’s evaluation. Children of mixed age learn in groups in a caring and calm atmosphere. Good relationships with families and whānau include regular information sharing.</p><p>The principal and head teachers lead a team of highly qualified staff. A board works closely with the leadership team in a governance role.</p><p>Teachers and management have responded positively to, and improved the area for development in the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be independent learners in an affirming and unhurried environment. They settle quickly and keenly engage in play on arrival. Clear expectations and flexible routines are responsive to children’s growing independence. Children confidently make choices about their individual and group play and engage purposefully for sustained periods. Literacy and numeracy experiences are woven into learning. Peer teaching amongst children is fostered and supported.</p><p>Teachers use a good range of effective strategies to extend children. Conversations make links with previous learning and home experiences. Children with additional needs are supported and monitored. Teachers liaise closely with parents, whānau and external agencies.</p><p>Curriculum design and implementation are effectively led by the head teachers. Staff respond to and track children’s interests. Ongoing discussions based on observations influence programme planning. Teachers include some aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in the programme. More regular review should increase teachers’ knowledge of how well the curriculum is responding to children’s strengths and interests.</p><p>Portfolios show that children’s interests are developed through the Montessori and <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Family and whānau backgrounds and experiences are evident in some portfolios. Learning stories reflect how teachers extend children’s learning. The next step for teachers is to record and integrate parent and whānau aspirations more often in these stories.</p><p>Transition to school is supported through an extended day session for children aged four and half. This group has a curriculum based on individual readiness for school, and this follows and extends each child’s strengths and interests. Teachers support parents and whānau as children move to local schools. Visits and meetings with new teachers assist families to share aspirations for their children’s early days at school.</p><p>The appraisal process has been reviewed in 2013. The new process includes teacher use of job descriptions and specific criteria to think deeply about how well they are teaching and changes they can make. External professional support is based on team and individual needs. Teachers share their learning with each other.</p><p>New leadership is being built in a collaborative and consultative way among senior managers and each classroom team. Strategic and annual plans set priorities with a focus on outcomes for children and the future of the centre. Managers value parents and whānau as key partners in their children’s learning.</p><p>Self review is a well planned process. It is used to reflect on the effectiveness of policies and practices, and to make changes. Evidence-based review is a developing strength. Regular progress reports from the principal provide the board with updates based on the centre’s strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>Increase teachers’ integration of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in learning and interactions in the daily programme.</li>
<li>Strengthen self review to include an evaluation of the impact of outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gisborne Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to Police vetting. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure they obtain a Police vet of every person who:</p><ul>
<li>the service provider appoints, or intends to appoint, to a position at the service</li>
<li>is to work at the service during normal opening hours</li>
<li>is not a registered teacher or holder of a Limited Authority to Teach. <em>[Education Act 1989, section 319D - 319F]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gisborne Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
