</table><p>Country Kids Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kids Childcare Centre is a well-established community-based education and care service that caters for children from birth to five years of age. The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on providing children with meaningful experiences in a safe and fun learning environment.</p><p>The centre has three rooms to provide age-appropriate activities and care. However, programme flexibility enables children to move between rooms and socialise with younger or older children.</p><p>Centre management and staff have built close ties with the local community. Teachers recently joined a learning cluster that strengthens professional relationships and support children‚Äôs positive transition to school.</p><p>The board of trustees which is made up of elected parent and community representatives works closely with the centre management team to support children and staff.</p><p>The centre has maintained the strengths outlined in the 2012 ERO report. Staff have made good progress in addressing the areas recommended for development including improvements to self review, teacher appraisal and assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a positive and caring environment. They are encouraged to help and care for each other. Infants and toddlers are well supported to become independent and confident learners. Older children are appropriately challenged by new experiences and questions that enhance their problem solving skills.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and art are well-integrated into the centre programmes. Teachers readily respond to children‚Äôs needs, abilities and interests. They value and use many of the ideas shared by children to enhance the centre programme. Children have many opportunities to learn beyond the centre environment.</p><p>Teachers respectfully use children‚Äôs prior knowledge to enrich the learning of others. Learning stories are well written and acknowledge the child as a capable learner. The stories clearly show the wide range of interesting learning experiences teachers provide for children.</p><p>Children experience positive and caring relationships in a welcoming environment. Teachers value children‚Äôs cultural backgrounds and place great importance on inclusive practices. They are aware of the steps to take to meet the specific learning needs of any child who may enrol at the centre.</p><p>There is a strong focus on incorporating bicultural perspectives into the programme. Children are able to hear and use te reo MƒÅori often throughout the programme.</p><p>The centre is well-led and managed. The management team is very well supported by an external advisor from another early childhood organisation. The team works collaboratively with staff to meet the needs of the children.</p><p>Staff benefit from selected professional development targeted to meet their needs. They have a shared understanding of self review which they use to make ongoing improvements to their practice and to the centre programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>refining the strategic plan to make the centre priorities more manageable over time</li>
<li>aligning the appraisal process to the new Education Council requirements</li>
<li>considering ways to deepen children‚Äôs learning and use assessment information to enhance teacher planning</li>
<li>sharing information about children as learners as part of their transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>25 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
