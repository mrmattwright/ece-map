</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glenavon Early Childhood Centre is located in the grounds of Glenavon School. The service provides full day education and care, as well as flexible sessional hours for up to 33 children over two years old. The centre is governed by a committee whose members represent the school, community, parents and centre staff. The wide range of cultures children and staff bring to the centre reflect the multicultural Blockhouse Bay community.</p><p>The committee delegates daily management of the centre to the head teacher who leads a team of fully registered teachers. They maintain a close liaison with the school, often sharing events and collaborating to support children's easy transition to school. Half the teaching team is new to the centre and there has been a review of the centre philosophy to include their perspectives on teaching and learning.</p><p>In 2013 ERO endorsed the centre’s cultural inclusion, strong partnership with families and respectful relationships between adults and children. These strengths continue to be evident. ERO suggested improvements to centre documentation and self-review processes. Work has progressed in these areas.</p><p>In 2015 teachers developed a ‘Heroes Mentoring Programme’ for children, whānau and staff. This has provided some aspirational goals for them and a platform to celebrate achievements. While teachers are planning to evaluate the impact of this programme, they are pleased that it has improved attendance and parents’ involvement in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and show a sense of belonging in the centre. They engage well with available resources and work cooperatively to share equipment. Children are learning to add complexity to their play. They draw plans to express ideas and respond to teachers’ prompts to consider different options. They have benefitted from teachers’ recent focus on mathematics and have become familiar with some information and communication technology tools. Children are learning to be independent and confidently manage self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers consistently support children to engage in learning. They work hard to integrate early literacy and numeracy in meaningful contexts and maintain a focus on supporting children's oral language development. Teachers’ interactions encourage children to think, join in conversations and contribute ideas. These strategies successfully support many children to learn English and prepare them well for transition to school.</p><p>The head teacher is a strong leader. At weekly meetings, she guides teachers to discuss children's interests and plan strategies to develop their play. While sustaining some long-term focus areas, teachers endeavour to link children's interests to valued learning outcomes and incorporate parents’ aspirations for children's learning. Teachers consult children about what they know and want to learn, and regularly reflect on the effectiveness of the programme.</p><p>Learning stories in portfolios document children's interests well and capture their positive relationships with others. Teachers have developed a digital portal for parents to engage them in children’s learning stories and will continue to strengthen the use of digital communication<strong>.</strong> This would be a good opportunity to simplify some stories and increase their readability for a community where English is not the home language for many families.</p><p>The committee is taking steps to improve the learning environment. The school has made the adjacent classroom available to the centre and is supporting refurbishment of the playground. As teachers develop the indoor space it would timely to review the display, accessibility and range of resources available to children. While it is important not to clutter play areas, sufficient independent choice and provocations can motivate children to become more persistent explorers.</p><p>Parents who were interviewed by ERO appreciate the sense of family in the centre and the strong connection with the school. They value the multicultural environment and the events that are celebrated. Parents believe the teachers know their children well, foster their interests and share positive relationships with them. They value the communication they have with staff, and opportunities to be consulted about their child’s learning. Parents notice the progress their children make in oral language in the centre and are pleased with their preparation for school.</p><p>The committee governs the centre well. Some members have a very long association with the centre and are committed to achieving its vision, goals and aims. They receive informative monthly reports from the head teacher and use their strategic and annual plans well to guide the centre’s direction. Committee members contribute to internal evaluation processes and encourage teachers’ ongoing professional development. They actively support fundraising efforts and the head teacher’s initiatives for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing programme planning and assessment to foster a shared approach within the new team</li>
<li>strengthening the bicultural environment and practices within the centre</li>
<li>continuing the property improvements to upgrade the outdoor environment and to better define and enrich indoor learning areas</li>
<li>consolidating the ongoing development of internal evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glenavon Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glenavon Early Childhood Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 August 2016<b> </b></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
