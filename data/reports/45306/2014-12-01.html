</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Orchard Preschool - McGarvey Road 1 is a privately owned, purpose built, full education and care centre and is one of four licences under the same ownership located in Whakatane and Edgecumbe. The centre caters for children from birth to two and a half in two age-based rooms. It is licensed for 30 children including up to 25 who are under 2. The current roll of 62 children includes 36 who identify as MƒÅori. The centre is one of two licenses on the same premises.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the premises have been extended and refurbished to include an administration area and an additional space for toddlers. Following an extensive self review of centre operations by the owners, a business manager was appointed in 2012. This was part of a re-structuring of centre leaders‚Äô roles and responsibilities in order to establish a more collaborative and consultative approach to leadership.</p><p>The owners reviewed the centre philosophy and identified the core values of respect, adventure, passion and whƒÅnau/family. These values now underpin all aspects of centre culture and development.</p><p>The centre warmly welcomes parents and whƒÅnau and has maintained strong community links through sponsorship of organisations and support of community events.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a high level of coordination across all four licences in terms of governance and management. The newly appointed business manager has facilitated a number of improvements including:</p><ul>
<li>the alignment of centre systems into a common framework that links to the overall strategic plan</li>
<li>a review of human resource processes such as staff appraisal</li>
<li>review of all policies and practices, and the establishment of an ongoing cycle of self-review</li>
<li>improved communication and consultation between the individual centres, and growth of centre leadership capability</li>
<li>stronger financial and reporting structures to ensure funding accountability.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders are engaging in professional development to strengthen their leadership of teaching and learning. They are using teacher appraisal goals to plan centre-wide teacher professional development. The owners, manager and leaders support the training and ongoing development of teachers who are working towards their qualifications. Leaders are aware of the importance of emergent self review, and have identified the need to strengthen self-review processes.</p><p>In response to identified teaching and learning needs, an external advisor is currently working with leaders and teachers to improve children‚Äôs engagement in the areas of play in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. This provides teachers with a planning framework to guide their observations of children‚Äôs learning and development. Teachers use this and other assessment information to enhance their response to individuals and groups of children. Learning stories and monthly observations identify and document children‚Äôs ongoing interests, strengths and learning.</p><p>Warm, caring relationships, aligned to the centre's core values, support children‚Äôs education and care. Teachers know infants and toddlers and their families well and provide them with a safe emotional environment. Teachers notice and respond to children‚Äôs efforts to communicate and develop their early language skills. Children are developing independence through an appropriate range of learning activities including exploration, sensory play, early literacy and mathematics, and construction. Responsive care routines provide infants and toddlers with a sense of security and belonging. Children benefit from a strong focus on the natural environment including interactions with animals.</p><p>Teachers model the use of te reo MƒÅori, waiata, pepeha and karakia. Aspirations of parents are sought on entry into the centre and at transition between the rooms. Effective communication is enhanced through termly celebrations of learning with parents. The use of external agencies, such as Group Special Education, supports children with identified learning needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre personnel agree that, in order to further raise educational outcomes for children, the areas for further improvement and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self-review processes and the usefulness of findings to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>improve the quality of teaching practice through implementing and embedding the appraisal process and continuing to provide appropriate professional learning and development opportunities for all staff</li>
<li>review, upgrade and extend centre resources (including for numeracy and literacy) in both the indoor and outdoor environments</li>
<li>increase engagement and information sharing with parents/whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Orchard Preschool - McGarvey Road 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>The centre owners need to ensure that all furniture and fixtures that could topple and cause injury or damage are secured in the event of an earthquake.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and Care Centres 2008, HS6]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Orchard Preschool - McGarvey Road 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>1 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
