</table><p>Whitiora¬†Kindergarten¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whitiora Kindergarten located in the centre of Hamilton is licensed for 45 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years to school age. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is a second language. At the time of this ERO review 55 children were enrolled, including 14 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòOur children are strong in heart, head and hand‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumƒÅtua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens are involved in a ‚ÄòCool 4 School‚Äô transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato ‚ÄòUnder 5 Energise‚Äô. The kindergartens‚Äô education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced Association personnel.</p><p>Whitiora Kindergarten's philosophy values children‚Äôs ways of knowing and being. 'Working in collaboration, strong, tall and proud like a stand of Kahikatea trees'. The Kindergarten aims to be united with the community, whƒÅnau, families, children and colleagues. The principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are the foundations of the curriculum, decision making and a guide for every aspect of pedagogy and practice. The kindergarten's philosophy is anchored by a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>In July of 2018 an acting head teacher was appointed. The kindergarten has responded to the previous ERO report by making learning visual, and informing the parents about what learning is taking place. Children's Individual learning plans have supported the teaching team to notice and respond to children's emerging interests.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are highly visible and valued. Learning partnerships between the kindergarten and home guide individual children‚Äôs programmes for learning. The learning programme is tailored to all children‚Äôs abilities, emerging interests and needs. Complexity is added to play which empowers children‚Äôs sense of what they know and what they need to learn. Children are considered confident and are curious about the world around them.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively designed through the context of the child, their family and the community. The environment is well-prepared and resourced to provide a rich learning space. Dispositional learning is actively promoted and learning outcomes are intentional and well understood. Authentic connections with the community enrich the meaningful local curriculum and children‚Äôs learning and their sense of self. Children experience an environment that promotes excitement for learning, wellbeing and fun.</p><p>Assessment builds a clear picture of what children know, understand, are interested in and can do. Individual planning, in collaboration with families is responsive to each child's abilities, needs and interests. Literacy and numeracy are authentically woven throughout play and are visible throughout the kindergarten. Transition-to-school processes support children's confidence as they move to the next stage of their learning.</p><p>MƒÅori learners are actively supported to achieve success as MƒÅori. The culture of MƒÅori children is acknowledged and valued. Children's learning pathways are identified and include emerging leadership and knowledge, valuing what children know and what they bring to their learning. Children are supported to make connections as they acknowledge the bicultural partnership of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers have extensive knowledge of children as learners and their learning. They actively seek ways to continually strengthen connections to children‚Äôs language, culture and identity. Children are listened to, recognised and valued for their working theories. Teachers encourage children to explore their working theories through rich conversation, providing effective oral language support. Teachers practice builds inclusion and removes barriers to learning for all children.</p><p>Leaders promote a collaborative approach to building teachers' professional knowledge. Emergent leadership is actively fostered and focused on building leadership capability across the kindergarten. Internal evaluation is effective and contributes to continual improvement to the service for children and their families. Kindergarten leaders are strong advocates for children's learning and wellbeing. Together with teachers they have established a strong partnership with children and families, especially those with English as a second language.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The association has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides sound, comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to high-quality, inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers is to further refine and enhance internal evaluation processes to ensure they are more clearly focused on outcomes for learners.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whitiora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whitiora Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
