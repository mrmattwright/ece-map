</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers Henderson provides all-day education and care for up to 126 children, including 35 under two years of age. Children enrolled come from mainly PƒÅkehƒÅ and Chinese backgrounds, with smaller numbers of MƒÅori and Indian children. They are grouped in six age-related rooms.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy recognises the importance of children learning through play in a respectful, caring and inclusive environment. The centre states its aim is to create "a safe place for children to express themselves, where they feel loved and they belong".</p><p>This centre is part of the Evolve Education Group, operating under the brand of Active Explorers. Evolve provides a policy and management framework, and a range of support systems to meet the needs of each service. The centre manager is delegated to oversee centre operations. Occasional cluster meetings with other Evolve centres provide a support network for centre leaders.</p><p>The centre manager leads a culturally diverse teaching team. Teachers are responsive to professional development, and have created a culture where children are valued, celebrated and affirmed. The centre has 12 registered teachers and four untrained staff.</p><p>ERO last reviewed the centre in 2014 under the name Leaps and Bounds. Since then a new centre manager and a head teacher have been appointed. Over this time, good work has been done to build teacher confidence in the use of te reo MƒÅori, and documenting self review processes. Further work is required to provide sufficient resources and develop the outside learning area for younger children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers greet children warmly on arrival into the centre, and children settle well in their activities. Respectful and responsive relationships underpin a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for children. Children transition well within the centre as they are developmentally ready.</p><p>Children are happy and engaged in their learning. They play cooperatively and have easy access to the outside learning areas beside their rooms. These areas provide opportunities to explore and be creative. It is timely to consider further ways to promote science and mathematics.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children. Older children are encouraged and supported to lead their own learning, based on their interests. There are good examples of teachers' questioning skills extending children‚Äôs thinking. The centre manager agrees that this good teaching practice needs to be consistent across the centre.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from caring teachers who promote a calm and peaceful environment. Education and care routines are appropriately individualised. Younger children have easy access to a separate outside area for their own exploration and play. There is a need to ensure all younger children have access to sufficient resources outside to create their own play.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to celebrate their own and each other‚Äôs cultures. Culturally responsive teaching practices are highly evident in the centre and children‚Äôs languages and cultural identities are valued.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to the ongoing development of bicultural learning approaches is building children's understanding of te ao MƒÅori. The bicultural nature of Aotearoa, New Zealand is reflected in the environment.</p><p>Teachers' planning is based on children's interests. Children's portfolios contain both group and individual learning stories. Storypark, an online tool, allows teachers to link children's learning visibly to the curriculum. It provides an opportunity for parents to extend and connect their child's home and centre interests. Teachers have identified the need to provide hard copy portfolios so that children can revisit special moments in their learning independently.</p><p>Children's inside learning areas are well resourced. While teachers display programme information about children‚Äôs learning, they could now review their displays to see if children have easy access to their learning and related activities.</p><p>The centre manager values a collaborative working approach, and promotes leadership opportunities for teachers and leaders. Staff meet regularly to plan activities and resources that promote a shared understanding of children's interests. Teachers could now deepen their evaluative thinking as they review their teaching and the learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Evolve Education Group is in the beginning phase of developing processes and new branding of Leaps and Bounds centres under Active Explorers. The organisation is currently developing its curriculum framework in order to align its overarching philosophy for its Active Explorers centres. A strategic plan is under development that will then need to be aligned with the centre's strategic plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further reviewing and refining room philosophies to more closely align to the philosophies of the centre and the new Evolve Active Explorers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teacher capability in questioning techniques that extend children's thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of indicators against the centre's own strategic plan, to measure the quality of progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To ensure continued centre improvement, Evolve managers should place a stronger focus on ensuring high quality support for the centre manager.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Henderson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Active Explorers Henderson will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 January 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
