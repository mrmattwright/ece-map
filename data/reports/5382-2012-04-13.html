<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Tairangi Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is situated just north of the Porirua shopping centre and continues to operate six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday. Children attending the kindergarten come from a range of cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific. Since the 2008 ERO review there have been staff changes including the appointment of a new head teacher in 2010.</p><p align="left">Children learn in an attractive, warm, welcoming environment in which their cultures are valued and celebrated. They settle quickly and enjoy the programme. Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau is valued and a family-friendly atmosphere is clearly apparent.</p><p align="left">The head teacher provides good leadership. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. They provide opportunities for literacy learning and groups of children manage their own imaginative and dramatic play for sustained periods of time. Teachers are encouraged to regularly reflect on their practice to continually improve outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Interactions between teachers and children are high quality. Teachers readily engage in ongoing conversations, explorations and discoveries. Children enjoy a variety of challenges and games to extend their learning and skill development. Learning activities and events are recorded and revisited through books, photographs and slideshows. Children are developing as confident learners.</p><p align="left">Teachers show a genuine interest in children&rsquo;s well-being. They promote healthy food and model positive, respectful conversations. Good provision is made for children with special needs, with teachers working in partnership with families and other agencies.</p><p align="left">Teachers are well supported by the senior teacher to further develop planned, in-depth reviews. As a result they continually improve their teaching practice to enhance outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Tairangi Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTairangi Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review was positive. Since that time there have been some staff changes including the appointment of a new head teacher in 2010. The kindergarten continues to operate six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday and consideration is given to family group enrolments. Children attending come from a range of cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Children learn in an attractive, warm, welcoming environment in which their cultures are valued and celebrated. Teachers take an active interest in the lives of families. Children settle quickly and family members often participate in aspects of the programme. A family-friendly atmosphere is clearly apparent.</p><p align="left">The head teacher provides good leadership. He encourages teachers to continually improve their practice to support children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers regularly engage in professional conversations as they notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning and development. The team has reviewed and developed wellconsidered procedures to guide programme assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p align="left">Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau is valued. Parents are invited to share the aspirations they have for their child and teachers make provision for this in the programme. Parents share their talents, talk with teachers on a daily basis and have easy access to information about their child&rsquo;s experiences in attractively presented portfolio books.</p><p align="left">Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests and supportive of their learning. Opportunities for literacy learning are sought and encouraged. Stories, kindergarten journals, letters and prompts give children many opportunities to use a range of resources. Past events are revisited through books, photographs and the use of slideshows. Large and small groups of children manage their own imaginative and dramatic play for sustained periods of time.</p><p align="left">High quality interactions between teachers and children provide many opportunities for ongoing conversations, exploration and discoveries. Children, with support from teachers, participate fully in a variety of challenges and games to extend their learning and skill development. Staff monitor play and are aware of and responsive to the dynamics within children&rsquo;s groups, set challenges and manage risk. Children are busy, social, confident and involved.</p><p align="left">Teachers show a genuine interest in children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. They promote healthy food, teach conflict resolution and model positive, respectful behaviours. Good provision is made for children with special needs through an inclusive approach and working in partnership with families and other agencies.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is well supported by the senior teacher to further develop planned, in-depth reviews that enhance outcomes for children. As the result of review teachers give greater emphasis to parent and child input into the programme and to recording children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The teaching team acknowledges that the next step is to focus on ways to respond to children&rsquo;s learning through recording daily reflections and children&rsquo;s learning stories. This should further contribute to interactions with children and enable families to see how their child&rsquo;s learning and development is challenged and extended over time.</p><p align="left">While teachers seek information about the aspiration parents have for their children, it is now timely to ask M&#257;ori and Pacific families about the desires they have for their children to be successful in their own identity, language and culture.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Tairangi Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendations</h3><p align="left">ERO and the kindergarten leaders agreed that the priorities for development and review are those outlined in the report.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">Acting National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;13 April 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-tairangi-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Tairangi Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Tairangi Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Tairangi Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is situated just north of the Porirua shopping centre and continues to operate six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday. Children attending the kindergarten come from a range of cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific. Since the 2008 ERO review there have been staff changes including the appointment of a new head teacher in 2010.</p><p align="left">Children learn in an attractive, warm, welcoming environment in which their cultures are valued and celebrated. They settle quickly and enjoy the programme. Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau is valued and a family-friendly atmosphere is clearly apparent.</p><p align="left">The head teacher provides good leadership. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. They provide opportunities for literacy learning and groups of children manage their own imaginative and dramatic play for sustained periods of time. Teachers are encouraged to regularly reflect on their practice to continually improve outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Interactions between teachers and children are high quality. Teachers readily engage in ongoing conversations, explorations and discoveries. Children enjoy a variety of challenges and games to extend their learning and skill development. Learning activities and events are recorded and revisited through books, photographs and slideshows. Children are developing as confident learners.</p><p align="left">Teachers show a genuine interest in children&rsquo;s well-being. They promote healthy food and model positive, respectful conversations. Good provision is made for children with special needs, with teachers working in partnership with families and other agencies.</p><p align="left">Teachers are well supported by the senior teacher to further develop planned, in-depth reviews. As a result they continually improve their teaching practice to enhance outcomes for children.</p></html>
