</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Casa dei Bambini provides education and care for children from infancy-to-school-age. There are three houses within the service, all managed by the owner. The owner is also the director. She works closely with a manager to provide leadership across the service. Two of the houses are under one licence on the same site. Casa is for children aged three to six years, and Nido is for infants up to two years of age. The third house 'Casita' provides for children aged between two-to-three years on a separate site nearby. Each house has a head teacher (kaitiaki) working alongside the teachers to provide a Montessori curriculum combined with Te WhƒÅriki. This report refers to Casa house and Nido house.</p><p>Since the ERO report in 2013, the owner/director has led significant change and improvements within the service. She has a management structure that supports a collaborative approach. This has enabled the skills of her teaching team to be used for the benefit of children and the centre community. The leaders and teachers have developed a comprehensive philosophy. This guides practice across the organisation towards achieving the service's goals for the future. The key aim of the service is that children become capable, confident, life-long learners. Teachers follow the children‚Äôs lead and nurture their learning and development through respectful, caring relationships.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Families and children are warmly welcomed and feel comfortable at the centre. The teachers are passionate about children‚Äôs learning and strongly believe in the values and aims that underpin the Montessori and Pikler approach. Teachers place high importance on developing respectful and trusting relationships between themselves and with the children and their families.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take responsibility for the centre environment and feel that it is their place. Teachers are respectful of children‚Äôs choices and value their input. It is the children who guide the teachers' responses and determine the daily programme.</p><p>Teachers deliberately create and foster a calm, positive, peaceful environment for learning. They have clear expectations for behaviour, and are consistent in the way they support children to cooperate at play and interact with one another. Environments are well organised, uncluttered and set up with a clear learning purpose.</p><p>Children are assigned to particular teachers who plan their learning and ensure their care needs are met. The knowledge teachers have about children is shared with other teachers so they can work together as a team to support children's learning. In the infant house, Nido, this is particularly evident. Teachers know the children very well and are highly responsive to their subtle non-verbal and verbal cues. Teachers conduct the day‚Äôs activities in a calm, unhurried and settled way that enhances children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers plan and provide a wide range of experiences that build and extend children‚Äôs interests. Mathematics, language and literacy learning are highly valued. The learning programme has a strong focus on supporting learning through real-life experiences that link to children‚Äôs home life. Leaders and teachers regularly seek parents‚Äô input into their child's learning, and discuss with them their child‚Äôs progress and next steps, and how these will be achieved.</p><p>A number of effective processes and practices help teachers track children‚Äôs progress. There is good evidence that children‚Äôs learning is increasing in complexity over time. Tracking systems are carefully monitored to ensure regular communication with parents and that information is up to date.</p><p>There is an awareness and celebration of the variety of cultures represented across the service. The mix of teachers and families from different cultures and backgrounds helps ensure that individual children with English as a second language receive the support they need.</p><p>The centre values MƒÅori culture. Teachers promote an understanding of key concepts and knowledge of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. These are evident in the daily programme and children‚Äôs knowledge in this area is growing. Teachers are implementing plans to further extend the integration of MƒÅori perspectives in the programme and environment and to build tikanga and te reo MƒÅori use.</p><p>Other practices that have a positive impact on children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strong, capable leaders who provide mentorship, and inspire and motivate teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the positive team culture and shared understandings of good practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the strong culture of continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner/director is very supportive of leaders and teachers and the programme for children‚Äôs learning. She and her manager provide regular in-house opportunities for all teachers to learn. There has been significant development in the teachers' understanding of self review/evaluation. There are now thorough processes in place. Reviews look closely at the centre and at teachers' practice, and how well these factors create positive outcomes for children. The regular, robust discussions and ongoing mentoring of teachers is proving to be an excellent way to support teachers‚Äô professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and teachers know that the priority for the service is to consolidate the significant progress made since the last ERO review.</p><p>Management systems and the effective self-review processes enable leaders and teachers to identify their next steps.</p><p>The leaders and ERO agree that leaders and teachers need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine the service's key learning priorities and align these with self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the development of evaluative practice and a service-wide schedule of review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan for ongoing service-wide bicultural development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' practice in implementing the Montessori curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have recently strengthened the service's appraisal system. This provides a good opportunity for teachers to share their learning and build best practice. Minor adjustments would further strengthen the process. It is also timely for the director to seek an external appraiser to support her professional development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori House Casa dei Bambini completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori House Casa dei Bambini will be within four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
