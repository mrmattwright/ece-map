</table><p>The Villa Montessori Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Villa Montessori Preschool was fully licensed by the Ministry of Education in November 2017. The centre is licensed for 29 children over the age of two years. Joint owners provide governance to their two Montessori centres. A new centre manager was appointed in February 2018 and works collaboratively with one of the owners to provide professional guidance and leadership to staff.</p><p>The owner holds a Montessori qualification and two staff are qualified, registered teachers. Staff and families are from a diverse range of nationalities.</p><p>The centre follows a strong Montessori philosophy and promotes independence, self-help skills and a love of learning.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience an environment and sense of belonging that helps them to take part in caring for this centre. The curriculum promotes children's independence and self-management. Children are capable and confident and learn alongside others in a respectful manner. Teachers make sure children know the routines and expectations for using the equipment and resources. There is a wide range of meaningful and structured play activities and high quality resources to support children's learning. The physical environment and natural resources reinforces the programme and approach to teaching and learning, with some underpinning by Te WhƒÅriki, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>Children's learning benefits from programmes that are grounded in the Montessori method of sequential activities which scaffold their progressive mastery of knowledge, skills and understanding. The programme and teaching has a strong focus on developing children's literacy and numeracy skills within the curriculum areas of music, science, biology and geography. Children are well supported as they transition into and within the centre. These transition practices are flexible and individualised to meet children's preferences and needs.</p><p>Teachers engage in thoughtful, shared interactions with children. They use a range of intentional strategies that include purposeful discussions and questioning to guide children's learning and promote oral language development.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn about MƒÅori culture, and teachers regularly use waiata, karakia, te reo, and tikanga MƒÅori practices to promote children's knowledge and understandings. Children's identities and sense of belonging are acknowledged and affirmed in a family like atmosphere. The tuakana/teina concept of learning is promoted and used well. Older children supporting younger children is very evident in the way children learn together.</p><p>Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of each child's learning and achievement. Records of learning show that the teachers know the children well. Planning for children's learning is specific and aligned to the Montessori framework. Leaders have recently introduced a digital programme for sharing significant moments in children's learning with parents. This is enabling parents to be closely involved in their child's learning.</p><p>Leaders encourage a collaborative team approach and value the expertise and interests of their teachers in extending experiences for children in the programme. Leaders have high expectations for teaching and learning and have a strong improvement focus. Teachers are encouraged and supported to extend their teaching capabilities through professional learning and development and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Teachers are developing a culture of reflection and inquiry into teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The centre has good management systems and processes. Governance policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. There have been some positive changes as a result of internal evaluation which support the ongoing development of the centre and its priorities, but this is at an early stage of development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre leaders are to continue the review and development of:</p><ul>
<li>the centre's philosophy and curriculum to more explicitly show the balance between the teaching of the centre‚Äôs Montessori values and the strands and principles of Te WhƒÅriki</li>
<li>building leaders' and teachers' knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation to include ongoing review to evaluate the impact of outcomes for children</li>
<li>strategic and annual planning to incorporate curriculum, teaching and learning goals, and ensure that they are clearly aligned with the centre's philosophy and vision</li>
<li>implementing the new appraisal process across all the teaching team.</li>
</ul><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Villa Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Villa Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>5 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
