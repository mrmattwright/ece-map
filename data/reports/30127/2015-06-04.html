</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids - St Francis Whānau Aroha, previously know as St Francis Whānau Aroha Centre, is located in the Westerns Heights area of Rotorua. It operates under the umbrella of Anglican Care Waiapu, which provides governance, management support and strategic direction for the service.</p><p>The centre provides care and education for children from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 28 children were enrolled and 22 are of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre receives equity funding through the Ministry of Education. This additional resource is used to provide nutritional meals, transport, extra staffing and experiences outside of the centre that extend children’s learning.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi and recognises children’s individuality. A key aspiration of the philosophy is ‘empowering children, parents and whānau to learn and grow within a caring, stable family environment, and incorporating Christian principles’.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since ERO’s last review in March 2012 there have been significant changes to centre management, the teaching team and support staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>All aspects of centre operations and practices strive to meet the service’s vision for ‘a loving and just society’. Core Christian and Māori values underpin the wairua of the centre’s culture that recognises and celebrates the inherent potential of tamariki and whānau Māori. In addition, these values are expressed through treaty-base practices and the close and genuine relationships staff have with tamariki, their families and whānau.</p><p>Anglican Care Waiapu provides sound and responsive support to ensure continuity for centre operations, guidance and mentoring for centre management and staff. The centre manager is knowledgeable, dedicated, and has a clear focus on providing children with the best possible opportunities and outcomes. She is a collaborative leader who works to empower teachers to maximise their strengths and talents, to be reflective and strengthen their practice.</p><p>The centre manager has been pivotal in refocusing and improving the quality of self review. Recent reviews have resulted in positive changes to centre routines, the environment and learning experiences for children. Self review would be strengthened through further development of strategic and annual plans. Such plans could then be used to monitor progress and evaluate the achievement and effectiveness of centre goals to enhance experiences and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The new teaching team are redefining curriculum priorities. There is a strong influence of Te Arawa kawa, tikanga Māori, tikanga Pacifica, tikanga Pākehā and stories from the Bible. Current emphases include children’s cultural and social confidence, partnerships with parents, transitions into the centre and to school, and the natural environment. The team has worked hard to develop a sound framework for assessment and planning. This revised approach includes a greater emphasis on individual children’s cultural identity, interests, learning, and parent contributions.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for children, and for parents as their first teachers. Relationships between teachers and tamariki are warm, affectionate and caring. Transitions into the centre are well supported and take account of the needs and preferences of children and parents. Teachers work well together to ensure children's’ learning and care needs are met. They skilfully engage alongside children as they play, following and extending interests. Te reo Māori is used as a functional language by teachers and is understood by children, some of whom confidently and spontaneously respond and use te reo Māori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is timely for the new team to review the centre philosophy and document the shared vision, values, beliefs and priorities that influence the curriculum, environment, teaching practice and desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers need to continue to review and develop assessment, planning and evaluation practice. This is necessary to strengthen their planned and spontaneous responses to children’s interests and learning, and evaluation of programmes.</p><p>The centre has recently included children up to the age of two years. It is therefore timely for teachers to develop a curriculum and environment, and agreed teaching practices that are responsive to the interests, routines and capabilities of these very young learners.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - St Francis Whānau Aroha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiapu Kids - St Francis Whānau Aroha will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
