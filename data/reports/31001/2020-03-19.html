</table><p>Aria Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aria Playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 25 children once a week. This includes 15 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, there were 10 children enrolled, and two who identify as MƒÅori. The centre is located on the grounds of Aria Primary School.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, ‚ÄòwhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together‚Äô, is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together.</p><p>Since the June 2016 ERO report, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation has restructured by amalgamating all associations to form Playcentre Aotearoa. Aria Playcentre is part of the Central North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and families share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre-elected office holders. A centre support worker and centre administrator regularly visit playcentres to provide professional support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Responsive and engaged interactions promote rich learning opportunities for children. They are encouraged to be independent, confident and competent learners. Children‚Äôs language, culture and identity is visible in displays around the walls of the playcentre. Parents as first teachers have developed good strategies to support positive behaviour and social competence. Children under the age of two years enjoy a calm and responsive learning space. It is age appropriate and allows for free movement, fostering curiosity and independence. Children develop a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre's programme of education and care is planned in response to children‚Äôs ideas and interests. Children choose from a wide range of resources and activities and are well supported by parents who notice and extend their learning and play. There are many opportunities for children to express and explore their creativity. They are involved in sustained play and making decisions about their learning. Strong relationships with the local school are supporting children to transition successfully. There is a focus on building the capability of members to use te reo and te ao MƒÅori during the session. This should be embedded into centre documentation including assessment for learning.</p><p>There are examples of assessment practice in children‚Äôs individual portfolios where parents notice and document children‚Äôs learning and show their progress over time. New members are encouraged and supported to recognise and record their child‚Äôs learning. The current self-review process requires strengthening. An evaluation framework should be developed with a focus on raising learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Positive and respectful relationships are promoted across the playcentre between leaders and members. All roles and responsibilities have been allocated and are well established. There is a process in place for knowledge sharing between experienced members and new members, and opportunities for professional learning and development.</p><p>The revised parent education programme is becoming more accessible to centre members. Many adults are engaged in adult education. Appraisal processes for session support staff have recently been strengthened to better evaluate performance in relation to specific roles and responsibilities, identify professional learning and development needs, and focus on achievement of goals.</p><p>The national restructuring process continues to require significant attention and support to implement an extensive range of systems and processes. Regular communication from Playcentre Aotearoa seeks to keep parents informed of progress, changes and upcoming requirements. National policies and procedures have recently been introduced and parents are in the process of aligning practices to these. Ongoing support is required to enable parents to understand and implement these procedures to meet licensing requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for Aria Playcentre, leaders and members are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a self-review framework with a focus on learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the capability of members understanding of te ao MƒÅori, and centre documentation in assessment for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should continue to build knowledge and understanding of policies and procedures to ensure licensing requirements are upheld.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aria Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to premises and facilities. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>securing items on shelves that could topple and fall on children and cause serious injury.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and care Centres 2008, HS6.</i></p><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, members have provided ERO with evidence of action taken in securing furniture (HS6).</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai P≈´tahi Nui</span></p><p>19 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>
