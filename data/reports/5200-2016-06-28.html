</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Strathmore operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). The kindergarten is located in Whakatane, and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. Twenty five out of thirty children are MƒÅori.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the head teacher and teachers have remained constant. Well-planned, self-review processes contribute to ongoing improvements. Children are at the forefront of teachers' decision making. The PouƒÅwhina provides teachers with appropriate support and guidance through the development and implementation of a curriculum that focuses on tamariki MƒÅori experiencing success as MƒÅori. A kaitiaki is also employed to model te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices for teachers and tamariki.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the CNIKT. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust works positively to provide equitable opportunities for all families.</p><p>Professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. They work alongside head teachers and teachers, and their leadership provides guidance and mentoring as part of the staff appraisal process. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional learning and development. As a result, teacher capability and skills are strengthened.</p><p>The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This has enabled them to increase the depth of teachers‚Äô reflections about their practice and respond to the expectations of the Education Council. They have also responded to the Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act, and the trust is well placed to complete required changes to policies and practices for the protection of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau experience an environment that is inclusive and is underpinned by the values of whakawhanaungatanga and manaakitanga. A high priority is placed on establishing positive and trusting relationships with children and their whƒÅnau. Teachers know their families well and are highly responsive to children's individual circumstances, learning needs and interests. WhƒÅnau appreciate the caring and welcoming interactions they have with teachers. The family orientated environment promotes a strong sense of belonging for children and their whƒÅnau. They willingly spend time in the kindergarten, and contribute their time and expertise to their children's learning.</p><p>Children enjoy time spent at kindergarten. They access high quality resources that motivates them to actively explore and investigate. On arrival, children settle quickly into self-selected activities and confidently challenge themselves through making their own choices and decisions. They take informed risks, investigate and solve their own problems and think critically about what they are doing.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for children and their whƒÅnau. They implement a range of well thought out strategies to ensure all children receive equitable opportunities to participate and learn. Teachers are skilled at supporting children's learning through encouraging and extending their interests. They notice, recognise and respond to potential learning moments and use a wide range of intentional teaching strategies. They view children as capable learners and support them to achieve success.</p><p>Children benefit from ongoing positive reinforcement and encouragement from teachers who provide them with affirming feedback for their efforts and contributions. Transitions into the kindergarten and to school are sensitively managed.</p><p>The kindergarten's curriculum strongly reflects the principles of holistic development, family and community and relationships and empowerment. These are strongly promoted through the implementation of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children learn through play, following their interests and strengths. Concepts around literacy, mathematics, science, and the arts are naturally integrated daily throughout the programme. Regular excursions to places of interest in the local community occur, and access to the beach and bush provides additional rich experiences. Children's learning is fostered in authentic settings.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices. Language, culture and identity are supported through meaningful and relevant experiences. Teachers are continuing to develop their knowledge and understanding of experiences that incorporate Te Ao MƒÅori concepts and teachings. This includes strengthening the use of te reo MƒÅori with children and sharing local MƒÅori history and stories. Teachers value and appreciate the support they receive from whƒÅnau and willingly incorporate their knowledge and expertise across the programme.</p><p>Children's social and communication skills are effectively supported. They have many opportunities to develop friendships, enjoy tuakana-teina relationships and learn alongside teachers, whƒÅnau helpers and members. Children are capable and confident learners.</p><p>Teachers have established high quality planning and assessment practices. Individual child profiles show their learning journey and celebrate their progress and achievements over time. These are shared with whƒÅnau who are well informed about their child's learning. They are also encouraged to contribute their aspirations and stories.</p><p>The head teacher provides strong leadership and is well supported by the professional leader. Teachers work as a collaborative team and share leadership roles and responsibilities. Their ongoing robust reflections about the quality of education and care children receive is well documented. Well-planned strategic self-review processes assist the kindergarten to continually improve all aspects of centre operations. Children's learning outcomes remain at the forefront of all decisions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten staff and management have identified through their robust self-review processes useful areas for future review and development.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to support teacher's to confidently integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices throughout the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers to continue to conduct and build on their inquiries for professional growth such as transitions and implementing a forest and beach programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Strathmore completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Strathmore will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
