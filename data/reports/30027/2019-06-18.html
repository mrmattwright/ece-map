</table><p>Te Whānau Pūtahi Early Childhood Education Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Whānau Pūtahi Early Childhood Education Centre is a non-profit community based centre that operates under the governance of Te Whānau Pūtahi Trust. It is one of a number of Christian-based community services under the trust. The service provides all day education and care in two age-based settings. The Pōtiki room caters for children up to two and a half years of age and the Kowhai room for children from approximately two and a half to five years of age. The service is licensed for 39 children including up to eight under two years of age.</p><p>The centre's mission is to journey with individuals and their whānau towards God’s wholeness and purpose’. The philosophy identifies a commitment to helping tamariki be ready, willing and able to learn, as they journey.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2016, key areas of improvement have been the development of a strategic plan that guides future direction, and the updating of policies in line with Ministry of Education (MOE) requirements. The board of trustees continues to set policy direction for the centre. The management team which comprises a centre manager and two head teachers has remained stable and there have been some changes in teaching staff. Most teachers, are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong relationships and positive interactions between teachers and children support their growing sense of belonging and security. Children are empowered to make choices and lead their learning alongside teachers and their peers. The wellbeing and learning of all children is nurtured in an inclusive and home-like environment. Teachers are responsive and caring. They know and understand children and their whānau well. Teachers recognise and are committed to extending their knowledge and understanding of te ao and te reo Māori. Further recognition of the language and culture of all children, is an area for development.</p><p>Nurturing and secure relationships with teachers enhance younger children's confidence and curiosity. Teachers respond well to infants and toddlers verbal and non-verbal cues to build conversation and enrich the learning and interactions with their peers and adults. Many opportunities are provided for younger children to make their own decisions and lead their play. Children up to the age of two are well cared for.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported to fully participate in the programme. Teachers advocate for these children and work alongside whānau and specialist agencies to provide good wrap-around services.</p><p>A range of rich opportunities encourage children to broaden their knowledge and understanding of their world and the wider community. The programme effectively provides opportunities for all children to explore their surrounds and experience challenge, creativity and success. Children learn karakia, tikanga Māori, some waiata and basic te reo. Learning portfolios recognise children's interests, strengths and needs.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are effective advocates for children's care, wellbeing and access to learning. Their collaborative, strength-based approach empowers teachers to share their reflections, about how their practice can continue to improve learning outcomes for children. Strong communication at all levels supports a culture of ongoing improvement. Internal evaluation is robust, with a focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The board of trustees is providing focused governance for the service. Trustees receive regular reports from the centre manager which they use to make informed decisions about priorities and direction for the service. The philosophy, based on Christian principles and the aspirations of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, is highly evident. Parents and whānau are consulted and actively encouraged to participate in decision making for the centre. Leaders acknowledge continuing to strengthen learning partnerships with parents, whānau and community is an area for further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to further raise outcomes for children, leaders and teachers need to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>partnerships with parents, whānau and community to inform the children's programme for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning and assessment to explicitly reflect children's learning over time in line with their intended outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the curriculum to reflect the language, culture and identity of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Whānau Pūtahi Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
