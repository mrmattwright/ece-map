</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cottle Kindergarten is located in Upper Hutt City. It operates Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm. Daily sessional places are available for children aged two to five years.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of creating a community of learners that values diversity and respects the environment through agreed core values that include: relationships, social competence, risk taking, sustainability and literacy and numeracy knowledge.</p><p>Cottle Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. This is the first review for this kindergarten since the merger.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the Wellington association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. Its introduction within this and other ex-Rimutaka Kindergartens occurred during 2015 with each kindergarten adapting it to respond to its community.¬†</p><p>The November 2013 ERO report for Cottle Kindergarten identified areas for review and development in relation to assessment practices, provision for MƒÅori and Pacific children and self review. These areas continue to be areas of ongoing focus for improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a child-initiated, play-based curriculum. They are mostly busy, purposeful and active learners. Teachers encourage emerging interests, and support their inquiries and investigations. Children‚Äôs risk-taking within a safe environment is well supported. They make choices from the wide range of rich learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers continue to refine assessment and planning processes and increasingly make use of Te¬†Manawa to guide their practice. They should further consider how assessment, planning and use of deliberate teaching strategies extends and challenges children‚Äôs thinking and learning.</p><p>Children develop skills that supports them to be capable and confident lifelong learners. Early literacy and numeracy experiences are meaningfully included throughout the programmes. Each child's learning and development is celebrated and shared between teachers and parents.</p><p>Teachers focus on developing strong relationships between homes and the kindergarten. Children with specific learning needs are welcomed and supported by close partnerships with whƒÅnau and external agencies. Teachers know each child and their personalities well. Parent involvement is valued. Regular communication with parents encourages increased sharing of aspirations for their child and contributes to programme decision-making.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori perspectives that allow children to experience te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are increasingly evident in the programme. Teachers recognise that further developing skills and strategies to successfully support MƒÅori learners in their language, culture and identity is a next step.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is promoted when they start at this kindergarten. Adults support parents to settle children according to their needs. Teachers‚Äô participation in cluster meetings with local schools and early learning centres supports establishing and building closer links with a range of schools. This involvement helps children moving to school.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback on agreed development priorities and the quality of teaching and learning. An annual internal evaluation supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The head teacher provides capable professional leadership and welcomes initiative. The teaching team is collaborative. Each teacher plays an active role in the kindergarten's development. A strengthened appraisal model is being implemented across the kindergartens. This includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability, and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Internal evaluation practices are becoming embedded as teachers become aware of the purpose to improve teaching and learning. There is a sound framework in place for review. Teachers have opportunities to contribute to and lead these inquiries. The senior teacher has identified key aspects of this process to continue to strengthen to improve educational outcomes for children. ERO's evaluation agrees with these findings.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders, teachers and ERO agree the following key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and embed assessment and planning practices</li>
<li>build on practices that support a culturally responsive curriculum and MƒÅori children's success as MƒÅori learners</li>
<li>develop shared understanding of processes for effective internal evaluation to enhance teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening responsiveness to MƒÅori children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cottle Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.<b>¬†</b></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cottle Kindergarten will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>23 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
