</table><p>Leadership and management of the service needs to be strengthened. Teachers require support to build their capability and capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for all children</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids Victoria Ave, is situated in Whanganui. It caters for 110 children, including 25 aged up to two. Of the 111 children enrolled, 41 identify as Māori. The centre provides education and care for children through sessional and full-day enrolments.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. The centre operates an all-day service, under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Ltd, which provides overall strategic direction and systems to guide and manage centre operations.</p><p>Significant changes in local and regional leadership have occurred since the May 2014, ERO report. A business manager and newly-appointed professional services manager oversee the centre. A new centre manager is responsible for daily operation, and is supported by two head teachers who oversee curriculum implementation. Most teaching staff are qualified.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for development including aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, and growing leadership capacity. Limited progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in play in well-resourced environments. A recent focus on the provision of age appropriate resources provides a range of choices and opportunities for children to revisit previous learning experiences.</p><p>Regular celebrations and events are well attended by families. Teachers are developing strong relationships with some whānau Māori and are beginning to connect with local iwi and marae. Building on these relationships and moving towards learning partnerships, remains a key focus to improve learning outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>Teachers are invited into children's play, but often opportunities to extend children's thinking are missed. Improving teaching strategies to support and enhance these valuable learning experiences, is needed.</p><p>Staff are responsive to the needs and routines of infants and toddlers and play alongside them. There is a clear focus on developing their early language skills. The planning and assessment process is beginning to support the individual interests and dispositions of these learners, through deliberate teaching practices. Leaders have identified that gathering and effectively responding to parents' aspirations is a next step. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>A useful online assessment tool supports connections between home and centre, enabling parents and whānau to add feedback to their child's learning stories assessment. Teachers use a variety of observation techniques to record children's involvement in the curriculum. Well-presented portfolio books provide children with a record of their participation at the centre.</p><p>Assessment and planning in the over two year old areas needs to be improved. Its focus on group learning is not responsive to individuals' culture, interests and learning dispositions. To develop practice, teachers need to increase their knowledge about effective and responsive planning processes. The ongoing review of the assessment, programming and evaluation system should include:</p><ul>
<li>how teachers planning supports children's learning</li>
<li>showing how children's learning becomes increasingly complex over time</li>
<li>effectively gathering and responding to parent aspirations for their children</li>
<li>drawing on children's cultures to inform individual planning.</li>
</ul><p>Some teachers use te reo Māori meaningfully in daily practice. Children are offered appropriate resources, waiata and karakia. Strengthening the bicultural curriculum including the use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori centre wide, is required.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are yet to sufficiently consider and respond to Pacific children's educational success. They agree that this is an area for development.</p><p>Teachers' knowledge of how to effectively respond to children with additional learning needs is in the beginning stages of development. External agencies support teachers to implement suitable strategies to cater for the needs of some of these children. Leaders have identified that this is an area to further progress and have taken steps to provide professional learning and development (PLD) to support staff.</p><p>Centre leadership and management requires strengthening. Inconsistency in teaching practices between areas is not promoting effective transitions for some children. Leaders and teachers have identified that an evaluation of what is currently happening is necessary to identify steps to further improve in this area.</p><p>A useful framework guides mentoring and appraisal. Leaders have indicated the appraisal system is under review at the governance level. There are many opportunities to engage in PLD. Some teachers are reflective. However ensuring that the collection of useful evidence, aligned to goals and the Practicing Teacher Criteria, remains a key next step.</p><p>Understanding and use of the self-review process requires strengthening. Currently, it is used as a research and development tool. Leaders have identified that a shift to internal evaluation is required to better focus on outcomes for children and the impact of teaching practices.</p><p>Regional managers show a commitment to ongoing improvement, and to using knowledge of high quality practice to inform change. The Beststart systems and processes support managers to identify areas for further development. In 2017, this support has been disrupted while a new regional manager and a PSM have been appointed. This process has been completed. Leaders and managers should now focus on strengthening organisational culture and professional practice to improve outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for development are:</p><ul>
<li>understanding and use of internal evaluation focused on outcomes for children</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation processes, particularly in the over two year old area</li>
<li>teachers use of te reo Māori me ngā tikanga</li>
<li>promoting educational success for Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>strengthening organisational culture, professional practice and aspects of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Victoria Ave completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements<b> </b></p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to curriculum.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>ensure the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning, and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whānau, and life contexts.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Victoria Ave will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>16 November 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
