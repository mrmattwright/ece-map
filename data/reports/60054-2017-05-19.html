</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wilton Playcentre is one of 19 parent-led early childhood centres governed and administered by the Wellington Playcentre Association (the association). The playcentre is licensed to provide mixed age sessional education and care for 26 children four mornings a week. This includes provision for 15 children, up to the age of two.</p><p>A council of elected volunteer representatives from each of the association's member centres, oversees the association at the governance level. This work is assisted by an operations manager and general manager. An executive committee administers the adult education programme. A centre support worker is employed to visit the centre and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for the day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders.</p><p>Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Three sessions are supported by a duty team of parent educators who hold playcentre training certificates. A centre member is employed for the fourth session. Many centre members are involved in the association's training programme. Parents come with a wide range of tertiary qualifications and are actively involved in their child's education.¬†</p><p>The association philosophy, WhƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together, is articulated as empowering parents and children to learn, grow and play together. This underpins practice and was reaffirmed by the association and Wilton Playcentre in 2016.</p><p>The service and the association responded positively to the areas identified for improvement in the 2014 ERO review. Internal evaluation and strategic planning were undertaken by association personnel to bring about changes to both the structural and organisational culture of the organisation. Clear boundaries between governance and management were expressed and changes made to improve support to individual centres.</p><p>The previous ERO report also identified that centre leaders would benefit from association support to further develop assessment, programme planning and the provision of a bicultural curriculum through improved self-review practices.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation, of which the Wellington Association is part, is planning a significant restructure for 2017 that includes amalgamating associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine in the Wellington Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The association philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> effectively underpin centre practice. A culture that values, celebrates and affirms children is highly evident. Positive relationships are established among all adults involved in the service. Parent educators work collaboratively. They enthusiastically involve themselves in the learning and wellbeing of all children.</p><p>Centre initiatives are effectively increasing parents‚Äô involvement in assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning. Adults have clear shared expectations and processes for responding to children‚Äôs interests and ideas. Centre members successfully contribute their views to programme planning. Leadership is encouraged and distributed amongst parents.¬† A range of professional development provides support for leaders and parents, aligned to their needs and aspirations.</p><p>Children are purposefully engaged in learning and confidently make decisions about their involvement and participation. Early literacy and numeracy learning experiences are well integrated into the programme and environment. Indoor and outdoor spaces encourage children to learn, investigate, develop their physical skills and engage in imaginative, creative play. Infants and toddlers are encouraged and nurtured to explore their surroundings. Parent educators play and work alongside children, supporting their developing skills and extending their thinking and language.</p><p>Parent educators demonstrate highly inclusive practices and positively involve children with identified learning needs in the programme.</p><p>Well-considered, clear strategies support children and their families‚Äô induction into the centre. Parent educators continue to develop increasingly supportive processes for children as they move to school.</p><p>A comprehensive internal evaluation was undertaken, during 2014, to discover how well the association and centres included te reo and tikanga MƒÅori as part of a culturally responsive curriculum. At Wilton Playcentre te ao MƒÅori continues to develop as an integral part of children's early learning experience. Appropriate resources, displays and practices that reflect te ao MƒÅori, support children to develop knowledge and understanding of their bicultural heritage. Parents are committed to developing their practice to continue to support MƒÅori children to achieve success as MƒÅori. Children‚Äôs cultural identity is acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Wilton Playcentre members are a diverse group of enthusiastic parents and whƒÅnau who bring valuable skills and knowledge to their roles. The high levels of involvement of the centre's community and a sense of collective responsibility to children, provide a positive platform for learning. Well-developed systems support the smooth day-to-day running of the playcentre.¬†¬†</p><p>The association is an improvement focused organisation. The 2014 ERO reviews found the support provided at the centre level by association support workers was appreciated. ERO also recognised that formalising this arrangement to provide a more effective approach to responding to the needs of individual centres was a next step for development.</p><p>The association, as part of reviewing its structural organisation, reviewed the position of centre support workers and made improvements to human resource management. Timely and relevant leadership and guidance is provided for its member centres.¬†¬†</p><p>Self review is very well used for accountability and improvement. Centre members have a good understanding of evaluation and use it to guide ongoing decision-making and improvement. Planning priorities are aligned to the service and association vision and focused on improving teaching and learning.¬†</p><p>The centre support person and duty teams provide effective leadership that contributes positively to children‚Äôs early learning experience. The inclusion of te ao MƒÅori, as an integral part of children's daily experience continues to strengthen through ongoing internal evaluation. Helpful strategies are in place to support newer members to the centre to document and record children's learning and progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association and centre leaders should continue to improve outcomes for children and families by using effective internal evaluation to ensure the very good practice occurring is sustained and prioritised developments are achieved.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wilton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wilton Playcentre will be in four years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>19 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
