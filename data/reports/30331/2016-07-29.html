</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kauwhata Childcare and Learning Centre Under 3 is located in a home that has been converted to provide education and care services for young children from 6 months to approximately 3 years of age. This is one of two jointly-owned private early childhood education centres on adjoining sites in Te Kauwhata. The adjacent centre caters for children over 3 years of age. The under 3's centre is licensed for 10 children with a maximum of 7 children up to two years of age. The current roll is 11 children aged under 3, of whom 4 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The owner/service provider retains overall governance responsibility for employment, strategic planning, finance and marketing. The recently appointed manager at the Over 3's centre is taking responsibility for aspects of professional leadership, staff appraisals and professional development. The experienced head teacher in the Under 3's centre is responsible for planning, assessment and evaluation of the curriculum, and daily operations of this centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to provide a homely environment where children experience responsive and reciprocal relationships. The centre works in partnership with parents/ whƒÅnau. The recently reviewed strategic plan identifies priorities for increasing enrolments and developing a more natural world surrounding in the outdoor areas.</p><p>The Under 3 centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the previous ERO review, the service provider has overseen a strengthening of strategic planning and the staff appraisal process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a calm and nurturing environment created by respectful and reciprocal relationships with teachers. Their physical, social and emotional needs are responded to by teachers with a deep sense of care, aroha and respect. Children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Familiar routines respond to the needs and rhythms of children and enable them to feel secure and develop a strong sense of belonging. Maintaining effective daily communication with parents/whƒÅnau allow teachers to build on home routines, which support children at times of settling and transition.</p><p>Teachers skilfully foster children's development of oral language and communication. They interpret and respond to the subtle cues offered by infants and toddlers, including body language and facial expressions. Teachers engage in one-to-one responsive interactions that follow the child's lead and enable them to develop independence and feel success.</p><p>The head teacher and teaching team work successfully together to plan, assess and evaluate the programme which incorporates the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are encouraged through appropriate use of resources, language, karakia and waiata. The head teacher and staff seek parent aspirations for their child and plan a responsive curriculum informed by observations and close knowledge of the children. The programme incorporates learning experiences that encourage the love of books and reading, the arts, early literacy and curiosity about the natural world.</p><p>Children's learning through play and exploration is supported by an environment carefully organised to allow children to be able to see and access a wide range of age appropriate resources and equipment. A special feature of the centre is the spacious and attractive outside environment that invites children to enjoy physical activity and challenge and interactions with the natural world.</p><p>Teachers prepare well presented and illustrated portfolios for each child to revisit their learning experiences and share with their parents/ whƒÅnau. To further develop these portfolios, teachers should review how clearly children's home experiences are reflected in planning and assessment.</p><p>Teachers in the Under 3 centre meet as a team, for staff discussion and centre organisation. It would now be of benefit to include the sharing of good practice associated with the current curriculum focus as part of these regular meetings.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree the key next step is to continue implementation of the strategic priority to support staff to plan and deliver a quality early childhood education curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kauwhata Childcare and Learning Centre Under 3 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kauwhata Childcare and Learning Centre Under 3 will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>29 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">.</a></span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
