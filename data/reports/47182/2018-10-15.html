</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Kids Childcare is a purpose built, all-day care and education centre, which opened in March 2017. It caters for children from birth to school age and is licensed for 115 children, including up to 45 who are under two years old. The centre is located near Hamilton’s central business district. The roll of 120 includes 28 Māori children. It also includes 37 children from other culturally diverse backgrounds.  </p><p>The centre is privately owned. The business manager, who is one of the owners, employs the centre manager to oversee staff performance and the centre-wide programme for children. The centre manager oversees three head teachers and two room leaders who each have responsibility for designated age-based groups of children and their teachers. Over 80% of staff are qualified with three teachers working towards full teacher registration.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy focuses on providing a professional learning community where children, teachers and parents/whānau feel a strong attachment to a “home away from home”. There are emphases on respectful teaching practices and loving, trusting and responsive relationships within a safe environment. Teachers believe that children learn through play and exploration and recognise parents as first teachers. The philosophy aims to embrace te reo and tikanga Māori and incorporate the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi within the daily programme. </p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Very effective teaching practices and positive, respectful relationships between children and adults are evident for all age groups. Teachers extend children's thinking through open questioning and warmly affirm their ideas and learning. The development of oral language, early literacy, te reo Māori, mathematics and science skills are responsively integrated within planned and incidental interactions and activities. Teachers provide many opportunities for tuakana teina support between siblings and children of different ages. Children with additional needs are inclusively catered for in consultation with parents and external agencies. Children sustain engagement in their activities of choice for significant periods of time and are becoming competent and confident learners. </p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a positive culture of nurture and care. Formal and informal communication with parents ensures that children’s individual rhythms and routines are recognised and respected. Care times are positive and respectful learning experiences. Teachers respond readily to very young children’s verbal and non-verbal cues. Environments for learning and play are calm, uncluttered and settled.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor learning and play areas are attractive, spacious and very well resourced. There is a wide range of well-considered equipment to promote learning, creativity, dramatic play and physical challenges. Wall displays make learning visible, promote a sense of belonging and contribute to the centre's welcoming home-like atmosphere.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively child-led with an appropriate balance of teacher direction. It emphasises learning through play, exploration and risk-taking. Practices that reflect tikanga Māori are well established. Transitions within the centre and to school are facilitated to cater for individual families. Children benefit from a curriculum that extends their interests and provides a broad range of learning opportunities.</p><p>Individual planning and assessment is responsive to children's strengths and needs. Teachers are committed to noticing, recognising, responding, and revisiting valued learning and identifying possible next steps for each child. Parents share aspirations for their children and are involved in identifying learning goals, which are regularly evaluated. Assessment records in individual portfolios are shared digitally and in hardcopy. They increasingly show a progression of learning over time.</p><p>Leaders work collaboratively with teachers and parents to promote positive outcomes for all children. The centre manager is knowledgeable and experienced in early childhood education leadership and teaching practice. Managers are promoting an emphasis on shared leadership along with generous provision of centre-wide and personalised professional learning and development.  The appraisal process builds and sustains effective teaching practice. Staff relationships are supportive, trusting and reciprocal. Centre managers have developed a positive, professional centre-wide learning culture for teachers, parents and children.</p><p>Governance systems and practices are effective. The centre-wide philosophy has been developed with input from parents and staff. Strategic and annual plans have been developed with assistance from an external adviser. Internal evaluation involves regular consultation with staff and parents and leads to improved practices. Staff, parents and children benefit from governance and management processes that provide clear direction for centre activities and operations.   </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps are to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>assessments reflect children’s cultural heritages</li>
<li>the appraisal process includes expectations for teaching as inquiry</li>
<li>the analysis and interpretation of self review responses is reported to staff and parents.   </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Kids Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Kids Childcare will be in three years.<strong> </strong></p><p>Adrienne Fowler<br> Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>15 October 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
