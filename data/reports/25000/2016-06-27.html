</table><p>Support from the Lollipops organisation is required to establish and consolidate aspects of centre practice, including curriculum management, performance appraisal and induction practices for children and for staff.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Central Park is owned and operated as a franchise with Lollipops Ltd. The centre provides all day education and care for up to 50 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age.</p><p>The centre was closed from July 2014 to August 2015 to enable the landlord to renovate the premises. Prior to the closure the centre roll was full. The temporary closure of the centre meant that employment contracts with staff were terminated and most teachers were re-employed in new positions in other Lollipops centres.</p><p>The centre has maintained the same licence and conditions, and is now managed by a director who previously held a head teacher position in this centre. She is supported in her role by a franchise support manager. The support manager was the centre's previous director. All other staff are new to the centre.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for the children of parents who are employed in the adjacent business park and for children from local families. The 25 children currently enrolled are from diverse cultural backgrounds. Two of the three rooms are in operation, with children moving into the older age group at approximately two years of age. The toddlers' room will reopen once the roll has increased sufficiently.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and teachers enjoy respectful and supportive relationships. Teachers provide activities that engage children and give them access to a suitable range of resources and equipment to support their learning.</p><p>Both the indoor and the outdoor areas are spacious and well organised. For much of the day children can more freely around the centre and choose how they spend their time. They enjoy opportunities to have fun as they learn, and their efforts and successes are affirmed by teachers. Children are supported to develop their oral language and early literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>The culture of the centre is very inclusive, and recognises the diversity of the children, their families and staff. Teachers purposefully include MƒÅori concepts, te reo and customs within the curriculum. They also acknowledge the customs, celebrations and languages of the cultures of other children who attend the centre.</p><p>Staff work in partnership with parents. Teachers have effective and regular communication with parents about their children and their time at the centre. Parents appreciate the use of electronic communication to help them stay well informed about their children and so they can share their thoughts and children's experiences outside the centre with teachers.</p><p>The manager recognises that with the reopening of the centre and the recent roll growth many children are transitioning into a new environment and getting to know many new people and different routines. This provides special challenges for teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers should now strengthen the centre's strategic planning to ensure that the centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children as the roll grows to capacity.</p><p>ERO recommends that the strategic plan include clear goals and action plans to build the staff capacity related to leadership, effective teaching practice, and team work. This could include actions to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen performance management practices so that teachers get useful feedback on their practice against indicators of best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen processes for inducting new staff into their roles and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO also suggests that the quality of the curriculum be strengthened by supporting teachers to use their assessments of children's learning to develop programmes that respond to children's interests, strengths, dispositions and needs.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Central Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Human Resource management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance by ensuring that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>performance appraisal practices include indicators of best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the centre leader is effectively inducted and supported into the director role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new staff are systematically inducted into their teaching roles</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Central Park will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
