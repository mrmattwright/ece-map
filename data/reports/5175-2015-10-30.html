</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Hazelmere operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The kindergarten is located in Te Awamutu, and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 42 children were attending, including 12 who are identified as MƒÅori. The kindergarten is open from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm for five days a week.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the kindergarten has extended its opening dates to include school holidays. While it continues to be staffed by long-serving teachers, at the time of this review a new teacher had just been appointed to the team.</p><p>The kindergarten has undertaken professional development designed to further engage parents and the community as partners in children‚Äôs learning. Teachers have worked to develop their self-review and assessment practice, with a focus on improvements to the curriculum and environment. Bicultural aspects of the programme have been strengthened to better support the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust‚Äôs professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers establish strong, positive and respectful relationships with children and their families. Their inclusive, welcoming interactions encourage children to participate and make friends. Children enjoy engaging in a variety of activities and experiences. They are able to make independent choices and plan the environment to suit their ways of working. The outdoor play environment prompts children to join in active play that develops their muscles and coordination. Groups of children like to play cooperatively, and create imaginative themes as they have fun together.</p><p>The kindergarten environment is spacious, attractive, and well equipped. Teachers present it thoughtfully to draw on its potential to trigger children‚Äôs interest in investigation and learning. The outdoor area invites children to explore the bush area, play in the mud pit, and engage in challenging water play. Children are also able to play imaginatively as they join in a variety of every-day family and community activities.</p><p>Children have opportunities to communicate with, and listen to one another. Teachers recognise that all children need to be competent communicators. They actively encourage oral language development by talking with children, supporting their interests, and extending their thinking and play. Extended conversations model language that children can learn and use to express themselves. Many children are confident to speak with adults.</p><p>Teachers use positive guidance to assist children to manage social relationships positively and to learn to solve problems. Aspects of literacy, and especially numeracy, are integral parts of the programme. Teachers also introduce opportunities to investigate science, and use technology to research information.</p><p>The kindergarten maintains reciprocal relationships with local schools. Visits from teachers and the establishment of buddy relationships between school and kindergarten children are designed to ease their transition to school.</p><p>Strong, trusting relationships are established with parents and whƒÅnau. Parents are comfortable to spend time in the centre and contribute to the programme. They feel well informed about their children‚Äôs learning through informal discussions and individual profile books that record their experiences at kindergarten. The introduction of on-line portfolios is encouraging parents to respond quickly to entries and share children‚Äôs home experiences. Parents readily share their aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning, and appreciate teachers‚Äô responsiveness to their suggestions.</p><p>Teachers have begun to deepen their knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. They explore myths and legends with children, and investigate values related to caring for the natural world. Continuing professional development in this area will further strengthen teachers‚Äô confidence with te reo MƒÅori and deepen the bicultural perspective of the programme.</p><p>Teachers have worked together to implement a self-review process that has enabled them to reflect on and strengthen their practice. This is assisting the teaching team to begin to develop a shared philosophy to guide their teaching. Their professional leaders have worked alongside them to support their ongoing professional growth and oversee the enactment of the trust‚Äôs overall philosophy.</p><p>Teachers high level of commitment to professional development is improving outcomes for children. They have begun to implement new appraisal procedures developed by the trust to meet the requirements of the Education Council. Teachers now have a practical appraisal framework for collecting meaningful records to support their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and professional leaders and the teaching team agreed, on the following next steps.</p><p>Teachers need to empower children to:</p><ul>
<li>identify their specific interests</li>
<li>make their own decisions about how to extend their learning</li>
<li>direct their own exploration, research and investigation.</li>
</ul><p>This approach is likely to strengthen children‚Äôs ownership and leadership of play and learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are to continue to develop and document assessment that:</p><ul>
<li>notices what children know, understand, are interested in and can do</li>
<li>recognises the deepening and increasing complexity of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>identifies and responds to children‚Äôs strengths, interests, skills and dispositions.</li>
</ul><p>This information can then be used to better understand children‚Äôs learning pathways, so that teachers can plan to continue and strengthen them.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Hazelmere completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Hazelmere will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
