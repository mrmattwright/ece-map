</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Turangi, formerly known as Topkids Turangi, is located in the township of Turangi. It currently provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. The roll of 44, includes 27 children of MƒÅori descent, many of whom have whakapapa links to the local iwi T≈´wharetoa.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Limited, which was formerly known as Kidicorp Limited. This organisation provides overall strategic direction and comprehensive policies and systems to guide centre operations. The area manager supports centre leaders and teachers to achieve BestStart goals and implement ‚Äòbest teaching practices‚Äô. BestStart has significantly increased opportunities for many local families to access early childhood education by providing a van to transport their children to and from the centre.</p><p>Since the October 2012 ERO review, there have been significant changes to the membership of the teaching team, including centre leaders. Successive teaching teams have made effective use of self review and individual strengths to address the agreed priority to continue to raise the quality of assessment and planning practice. The current teaching team of six includes three fully qualified early childhood teachers and one primary trained teacher.</p><p>The teaching team values open and trusting relationships that support the tikanga of ako (reciprocal teaching and learning) whakarongo (listening) and manaakitanga (helping and empowering others). Teachers acknowledge the holistic way that children learn. They aim to provide an environment that fosters aroha (love and empathy), atawhaitanga (encouragement) and kaitiakitanga (caring for others and the environment). Teachers also value whakapapa (whƒÅnau links) and their place within, and their connections with the Turangi community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy playing, learning and making friends in a calm, welcoming and well-resourced learning environment. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and whanaungatanga. Children confidently make choices, sustain interests and engage in meaningful, and often complex, play. ERO observed many examples of children collaborating, conversing and relating positively to one another. They show empathy, take on tuakana-teina roles, manaaki and awhi the learning of others.</p><p>MƒÅori children benefit from the many opportunities to participate and contribute as tangata whenua in the centre and wider community. WhƒÅnau appreciate and value these opportunities and the confident way that their tamariki share karakia, waiata, haka and NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa values with them at home.</p><p>Adult interactions with children are respectful, nurturing and caring. Teachers know children and their families well. They implement highly effective strategies in response to individual children‚Äôs strengths, needs and learning dispositions. Teachers listen carefully to children, skillfully extend their interests and ideas, and add depth to learning. They also support children to set and achieve their own goals.</p><p>The curriculum strongly reflects the centre‚Äôs philosophy, and is thoughtfully designed and implemented. Features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>goals to support foundation skills and foster dispositions for life-long learning with clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em></li>
<li>meaningful integration of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa tikanga and kawa, and the languages, cultures and identities of all children</li>
<li>authentic opportunities for children to develop interests, skills and knowledge relating to literacy, mathematics, technology and science</li>
<li>high levels of parent and whƒÅnau involvement in the curriculum, and decisions about their children‚Äôs learning and development.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers understand that oral language is fundamental to children‚Äôs success. They place a strong emphasis on identifying children‚Äôs language abilities and accessing and providing timely support when necessary. Children benefit from rich and meaningful opportunities within the programme to develop their oral language and become confident communicators.</p><p>The teaching team has developed meaningful and effective processes for documenting children‚Äôs interests and learning. Teachers make good use of this information, and parents‚Äô ideas, to develop strategies to extend children‚Äôs learning. Centre leaders acknowledge that teachers could further enhance learning outcomes for children by more systematically implementing these plans.</p><p>Effective leadership is integral to the centre‚Äôs success in providing positive outcomes for children and families. The BestStart area manager works collaboratively with centre leaders to provide high quality professional leadership and support for the teaching team. Features of centre leadership include:</p><ul>
<li>open, honest and reciprocal communication, respectful relationships and celebration of diversity</li>
<li>high expectations supported by focused professional learning and development, coaching and mentoring</li>
<li>a well-established culture of ongoing reflection and self review based on clearly-defined indicators of ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In keeping with the centre‚Äôs strategic focus on ‚Äòstriving for excellence‚Äô ERO and centre leaders have identified key priorities for centre staff. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop cultural understandings and shared expectations in relation to tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>discuss and consider the NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa education plan and its implications for staff, children and families</li>
<li>continue to strengthen relationships with local primary schools</li>
<li>facilitate sharing of information to support positive transitions to school and continuity of learning for children and families.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Turangi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Turangi will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>12 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
