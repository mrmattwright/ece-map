</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kristin School Kindergarten is part of a large private school in Albany. The kindergarten provides high quality education and care during school hours for 40 children aged from three to five years.</p><p>Children are grouped according to their ages in four classes of 10 children. Each class has its own teacher. Children in the oldest group move with their teacher to become a Year 0 class in Kristin Primary School.</p><p>The kindergarten has a very experienced, well qualified teaching team. The head teacher is the Kindergarten Dean and reports to the Junior School Principal. About a quarter of the families with children at the kindergarten are from non-English speaking backgrounds. These families are mainly of Chinese ethnicity.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy and teaching programmes are derived from the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children are taught to understand that learning is about asking questions, looking for answers and developing more complex questions. They are also helped to understand that they have a responsibility for their own learning. Values and character-building are prominent in children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Both the 2007 and 2011 ERO reports acknowledged the kindergarten‚Äôs good quality self review and the very good practices evident for promoting children‚Äôs learning, development and wellbeing. The high quality service provided for children and their families has been sustained. Self review continues to be highly effective in promoting improvements and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy their day at the kindergarten. They enjoy the company of other children, making friends and responding to their teachers. They fully engage in the many interesting and varied learning activities provided. Children are encouraged to think about their learning, inquire, set goals and take risks. They delight in acquiring new knowledge, extending their skills and sharing what they know with others. They are confident, competent learners.</p><p>Parents and families are highly supportive of, and well informed about, their children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. The relaxed welcoming environment helps parents to feel at home in the kindergarten and to become a part of the Kristin family. Weekly class newsletters, term reports and child-led conferences, where children explain their learning, help to inform parents about their children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. The values of love, integrity and respect prevail.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning programmes are well designed and thoroughly planned. They are relevant and meaningful, and meet the expectations of <em>the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme</em> and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Teachers keep comprehensive records of children‚Äôs learning and development. They know the children and their families well. They support children with special talents and needs, and those who speak languages other than English. Teachers give children opportunities to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Children are provided with high quality learning environments that have been refurbished since 2011. Colourful wall displays that include children‚Äôs work, and an attractive outdoor area with well tended gardens, help children to be proud of their own achievements and their school. Children‚Äôs learning opportunities are significantly extended by access to the school‚Äôs facilities, including the library, playgrounds and specialist science equipment. Excursions such as visits to local marae and beaches also support children‚Äôs extended learning.</p><p>Kindergarten leadership and effective self review underpin the provision of high quality education and care. The kindergarten staff are loyal, very experienced, and work collaboratively to benefit children and the school. The head teacher has established and maintained long-term relationships with the school‚Äôs kaumatua. She has instigated several significant changes, such as a highly successful transition to school programme and, beginning in 2014, extended hours of service, including school holidays. These developments, together with responsiveness to external and internal review, are indicative of the kindergarten‚Äôs capacity to continue to maintain a high quality service for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO endorses the next steps identified by the service for sustaining high performance through ongoing self review. Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy, vision and goals, in partnership with families and the community</li>
<li>continuing to promote a school-wide policy that recognises MƒÅori as tangata whenua and supports MƒÅori language and culture in children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kristin School Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a¬†potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kristin School Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
