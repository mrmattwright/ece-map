</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). The kindergarten is located in Morrinsville, and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review, 74 children were attending, including 12 who are identified as MƒÅori. The kindergarten is open from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm for five days a week.</p><p>There have been changes to the operation of the kindergarten since the 2012 ERO review. At the beginning of 2015 the kindergarten changed from a sessional to an all-day programme, and introduced flexible enrolment for children from two years of age. An additional teacher was appointed to the kindergarten to cater for the additional children now attending. These changes have been made to meet the needs of families.</p><p>The kindergarten has worked to address areas for development and review identified in the previous ERO report. With the support of the professional leader appointed by CNIKT, the head teacher and staff team have developed a collegial culture and significant improvements to their self-review practices. They are also taking a more reflective and shared approach to teaching. Teachers show a strong commitment to including a focus on te ao MƒÅori, and this is now evident in the environment, programme, and community relationships.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te</em> <em>WhƒÅriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust works positively to provide equitable opportunities to families by extending its hours of opening.</p><p>Professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. They work alongside head teachers to support and their leadership and provide guidance, and to mentor teachers as part of the appraisal process. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers‚Äô reflections about their practice. The trust has also responded effectively to the Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act, and is well-placed to complete required changes to policies and practices for the protection of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are learning in a positive and inviting environment where they are welcomed and included. They have warm, caring and trusting relationships with teachers and adults. Children explore the environment actively, and are encouraged to challenge themselves and take safe risks. They are provided with a rich variety of learning opportunities that enable them to explore, discover and experiment. Tuakana-teina relationships are evident, and particularly older children support younger children to participate in play.</p><p>Teachers know children well and have a good understanding of their interests and preferences. They engage with children at their level, responding to their play and developing conversations that are responsive to children‚Äôs ideas and inquiries. Teachers support children‚Äôs creativity and developing knowledge. Literacy and numeracy are included naturally as part of everyday learning. Teachers support the progress of children with diverse needs, seeking external advice and assistance as appropriate.</p><p>The curriculum is based on the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whariki</em>, and increasingly reflects MƒÅori perspectives. The kindergarten takes an active role in the Piako Cultural Festival, involving children in learning to perform waiata in a community context. Aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are evident in the kindergarten environment. This includes a whakaaro hui, which represents the kindergarten philosophy and is appreciated by parents and children. A playhouse in the form of a wharenui is used to introduce children to MƒÅori tikanga and protocols. Teachers are becoming increasing confident in using te reo MƒÅori in their conversations with children. The kindergarten promotes an inclusive environment that celebrates the cultures of children from a number of ethnicities.</p><p>Parents appreciate receiving information and support as their children prepare to transition to school. Children are able to recognise future classmates from a display of former kindergarten attendees.</p><p>Planning and assessment has been an area of development. The recent introduction of weekly meetings is enabling teachers to share children‚Äôs current learning and discuss possible teaching interactions. By linking observations and assessments, teachers will be increasingly able to make ongoing growth and development visible to children and their parents through their well-presented individual learning journals.</p><p>Teachers are using a range of strategies to enhance their partnership with parents. These include newsletters, parents‚Äô ready access to children‚Äôs learning portfolios, and online portfolios that assist parents to respond to teachers‚Äô entries about children‚Äôs learning. Parents are welcome to spend time in the kindergarten and contribute to the programme.</p><p>The team has well-developed processes for self review. They work hard to identify areas where they can improve outcomes for children and develop their professional skills to respond to changing needs and circumstances. This has assisted them to respond successfully to recent changes to the ages of children and their hours of attendance.</p><p>The head teacher is experienced, well informed and keeps up to date with best practice in early childhood education. She has taken a key role in developing a positive team culture where there is a shared sense of responsibility within the kindergarten. The head teacher also promotes positive relationships with whƒÅnau and the community. She is well supported by a professional leader who is well placed to provide advice, support and direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the teachers should continue to sustain and develop the current initiatives in the areas of:</p><ul>
<li>self review, to inform and set directions for ongoing improvement</li>
<li>appraisal, to include lines of inquiry for each teacher, and a focus on demonstrating improvement in teaching practice over time</li>
<li>planning and assessment, in order to be able to illustrate and support continuity in learning and demonstrate children‚Äôs progress in a range of contexts.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
