<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Whangamata Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Kindergarten Association and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. There are currently 31 children enrolled. The kindergarten is located in the coastal town of Whangamata and offers an option of sessional or school-day programmes.</p><p>Children learn in a safe, supportive and welcoming environment. The kindergarten&rsquo;s culture is highly inclusive, with positive, affirming and respectful relationships amongst children and adults. Teachers place great importance on encouraging children to develop and explore their imagination and creativity.</p><p>The head teacher is an effective leader who has built a strong, collegial team of highly competent teachers. They are committed to providing the best possible educational experiences for children and their families. Teachers discuss individual children&rsquo;s progress, reflect on group dynamics, and plan together to respond to emerging interests and children&rsquo;s exploration and inquiry.</p><p>The kindergarten operates in a modern, expansive and stimulating learning environment. There is a wide range of high-quality equipment and materials freely available to children in all learning areas. Displays and individual portfolios, that include parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children, provide a comprehensive record of learning, participation and development. Parents are well informed and included as important partners in their children&rsquo;s development and learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Whangamata Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWhangamata Free Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Whangamata Free Kindergarten benefits from the governance oversight of the Tauranga Kindergarten Association. There have been a number of changes in teaching staff over the last three years. The new teaching team have established effective relationships with each other and with the local community.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Leadership and teamwork:</strong> The head teacher is a highly effective leader who has built a strong, inclusive team of teachers. She has encouraged staff to take responsibility for aspects of kindergarten operations, and promoted the development of a culture of reflection and robust, effective self review. Teachers are very competent, reflective and collegial practitioners who are committed to providing the best possible educational experiences for children and their families. Team members have high levels of confidence in each other&rsquo;s skills and professionalism.</p><p><strong>Interactions and relationships:</strong> Positive, affirming and respectful relationships are clearly evident amongst children, parents and teachers. Teachers model appropriate behaviours and trust children to use the equipment and environment safely and confidently. Children are encouraged to share their knowledge, skills, ideas and to value other opinions. Parents are well informed and included as important partners in their children&rsquo;s development and learning.</p><p><strong>Programme and planning:</strong> The programme effectively encourages and promotes children as self-managing learners. Children benefit from teachers who are highly responsive to their interests and provide a wide range of stimulating experiences and learning opportunities. There is a clear focus on children&rsquo;s literacy evident through their enjoyment of books, writing and participation in dance, music and dramatic play. Many learning experiences are built around a living world context. Teachers use complex conversations to support children&rsquo;s developing oral language.</p><p>Teachers plan, review and assess the programme and children&rsquo;s learning as a team. They discuss individual children&rsquo;s progress, reflect on group dynamics and plan together to respond to emerging interests and extend children&rsquo;s exploration and inquiry. Teachers place great importance on encouraging children to develop and explore their inherent imagination and creativity.</p><p>Centre displays and individual portfolios provide a comprehensive record of learning, participation and development. Parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children are recorded, discussed and included in individual development plans considered at formal, twice-yearly meetings and regularly revisited through the portfolios.</p><p><strong>Environment:</strong> A modern, expansive and stimulating learning environment, reflects the local area, encourages children&rsquo;s physical activity and exploration, supports teachers&rsquo; professional needs and provides welcoming spaces for families and wh&#257;nau. Indoor areas are attractive, well set out, and invite children to experiment, explore and manipulate equipment and resources. Children&rsquo;s creativity is valued and encouraged. Outdoor areas provide opportunities for children to participate in more active play and encourage the development of social and cooperative skills. There is a wide range of high-quality equipment and materials freely available to children in all learning areas.</p><h4>Areas for further development</h4><p>The association recently developed a framework to oversee the performance management of staff. The first cycle of this framework is yet to be fully implemented. Centre leaders now need to review and enhance the way in which teacher professional growth and development are encouraged and supported.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service the kindergarten retains the ability it has demonstrated in previous years to effectively provide for the specific needs of identified children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Whangamata Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><p>5.1 the association continue to review the effectiveness of its systems to guide the development and appraisal of teachers, support their continual professional growth and provide quality assurance to the association.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>29 February 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-whangamata-free-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Whangamata Free Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Whangamata Free Kindergarten.</p><p>Whangamata Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Kindergarten Association and is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. There are currently 31 children enrolled. The kindergarten is located in the coastal town of Whangamata and offers an option of sessional or school-day programmes.</p><p>Children learn in a safe, supportive and welcoming environment. The kindergarten&rsquo;s culture is highly inclusive, with positive, affirming and respectful relationships amongst children and adults. Teachers place great importance on encouraging children to develop and explore their imagination and creativity.</p><p>The head teacher is an effective leader who has built a strong, collegial team of highly competent teachers. They are committed to providing the best possible educational experiences for children and their families. Teachers discuss individual children&rsquo;s progress, reflect on group dynamics, and plan together to respond to emerging interests and children&rsquo;s exploration and inquiry.</p><p>The kindergarten operates in a modern, expansive and stimulating learning environment. There is a wide range of high-quality equipment and materials freely available to children in all learning areas. Displays and individual portfolios, that include parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children, provide a comprehensive record of learning, participation and development. Parents are well informed and included as important partners in their children&rsquo;s development and learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
