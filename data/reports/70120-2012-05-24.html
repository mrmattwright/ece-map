<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Somerfield Playcentre is one of 49 operating playcentres that are administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is open for five sessions each week.</p><p align="left">The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative. All parents take responsibility and share leadership for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in playcentre&rsquo;s early childhood education training programme.</p><p align="left">Coordinators and parents provide a warm, welcoming and caring environment for adults and children. The adults know the children well. The centre maintains useful links with local schools that help children and their families to move on to school successfully.</p><p align="left">Children have a strong sense of belonging and are confident to make their own choices in the programme.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s learning benefits from the spacious outdoor area that provides many opportunities for them to be involved in physical play and making discoveries. Coordinators and adults actively involve themselves in the children&rsquo;s play.</p><p align="left">The centre has made good progress with the recommendations of the 2008 ERO review. It has received support from the association and maintains good relationships with them.</p><p align="left">This review occurred during the time of the Canterbury earthquakes. The association and coordinators have provided a good level of support to families during this time.</p><p align="left">The coordinators have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to refine children&rsquo;s assessment and programme planning; and strengthen the ways they review the centre&rsquo;s programme and operation.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Somerfield Community Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSomerfield Community Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The playcentre&rsquo;s mission and vision strongly focus on empowering children and families through supportive and caring relationships. Parents are recognised as children&rsquo;s first educators. The curriculum document, Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum is the basis for the programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Relationships</h5><p align="left">Children benefit from positive, supportive and caring relationships with adults that enhance their sense of belonging. ERO observed children and adults enjoying each other&rsquo;s company and having fun together. The playcentre is building good relationships with local schools that help to support children and their families to successfully transition to school</p><h5>Holistic development</h5><p align="left">Adults make good use of conversations to support children&rsquo;s language development. Many adults effectively use questioning to extend on children thinking. Adults are very responsive to children&rsquo;s learning interests and provide opportunities for children to extend on their ideas. Adults encourage children&rsquo;s independence. Children generally play well together, share ideas and develop friendships. On the day of the review, many children were well engaged in their interests for sustained periods of time.</p><p align="left">Informative visual displays provide parents with useful ways they can support children&rsquo;s experiences at playcentre and make links to home. Systems that help to support the ongoing sustainability of the playcentre have been collaboratively developed.</p><h5>Families and communities</h5><p align="left">ERO observed adults working well together and communicating effectively. Families are made to feel warmly welcome. Many parents/wh&#257;nau are comfortable to spend time at the playcentre and stay for periods of time. They contribute to the effective operation of the playcentre. ERO observed te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori being integrated in ways that are meaningful to children and families. There is a wide range of choices and activities for children to be involved in. Experiences in the wider community support and build on children&rsquo;s interests.</p><h5>Empowerment</h5><p align="left">Children are confident to make their own choices in the child-led programme. Children&rsquo;s individual profile books are well presented and provide a good record of their interests and learning. Adults make good use of children&rsquo;s assessment to inform what happens for them in the programme. Parents regularly share information to support children&rsquo;s well-being and learning. Literacy is well integrated in the environment. ERO observed children sharing and enjoying books, and using them as reference tools. Adults provide consistent expectations and positive guidance to support children&rsquo;s social skills.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The coordinators have identified and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to refine and consolidate children&rsquo;s assessment and programme planning and strengthen aspects of self review.</p><p align="left">In assessment:</p><ul>
<li>more consistently showing the next steps adults will use to build on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>more clearly showing children&rsquo;s progress over time.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In planning:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly showing the impact of the planned programme on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Self review</p><ul>
<li>extending spontaneous self-review practices to include the impact of these on learning outcomes for children and on the role of the adult.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Somerfield Community Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice, playcentre coordinators and the centre support team should:</p><p align="left">3.1 review the appraisal processes so that they support the ongoing improvement of teaching practices.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

The playcentre is open for five sessions each week.</p><p align="left">The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative. All parents take responsibility and share leadership for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre. The association offers opportunities for parents to train in playcentre&rsquo;s early childhood education training programme.</p><p align="left">Coordinators and parents provide a warm, welcoming and caring environment for adults and children. The adults know the children well. The centre maintains useful links with local schools that help children and their families to move on to school successfully.</p><p align="left">Children have a strong sense of belonging and are confident to make their own choices in the programme.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s learning benefits from the spacious outdoor area that provides many opportunities for them to be involved in physical play and making discoveries. Coordinators and adults actively involve themselves in the children&rsquo;s play.</p><p align="left">The centre has made good progress with the recommendations of the 2008 ERO review. It has received support from the association and maintains good relationships with them.</p><p align="left">This review occurred during the time of the Canterbury earthquakes. The association and coordinators have provided a good level of support to families during this time.</p><p align="left">The coordinators have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to refine children&rsquo;s assessment and programme planning; and strengthen the ways they review the centre&rsquo;s programme and operation.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
