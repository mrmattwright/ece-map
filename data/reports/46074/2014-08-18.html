</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reach Forward Early Learning Centre ‚Äì Kaipara House caters for infants and children up to school age. The centre operates from an attractive, historic villa on the main road to the Helensville and Parakai townships. It offers a high quality, homely and welcoming environment for children and their families.</p><p>Children are grouped into three separate areas depending on their age and stage of development. Babies and toddlers, and children over two years have rooms in the main house, with children closer to five catered for in a separate cottage on the same grounds. There is a spacious outdoor area that provides opportunities for children of mixed ages to play and interact together.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based on Christian principles and practice. There is a stable teaching team of qualified educators and most teachers are fully registered. The director owns the centre and also provides overall leadership for the centre.</p><p>The centre opened in January 2013. There is another centre with the same name and ownership in Albany.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm and affirming relationships with their teachers and each other. They settle easily into the routines of the day and are confident that adults will cater for their care needs. Teachers are gentle and respectful in their interactions with children. They provide clear expectations for behaviour and have useful strategies for maintaining children‚Äôs focus in learning programmes. Teachers take the time needed to get to know children and their families. As a result children feel secure and have a sense of belonging in their centre environment.</p><p>Babies and toddlers benefit from the continuity of two experienced teachers. These teachers promote very good communication between home and the centre and support parents with home routines. They provide a calm and nurturing space, with ample opportunities for warmth and fun. Activities for these younger children are appropriate for their stages of development. Teachers carefully support children to transition when they are old enough or ready to move into the over two-year-old area.</p><p>Older groups of children experience a combination of focused, teacher-led programmes and opportunities for child led activities. Focused teaching times are usually planned with literacy and numeracy learning in mind and may occur in small groups or during mat times. Teachers ensure that literacy and numeracy learning also happens in the context of children‚Äôs play. Children complete project work and have good opportunities for learning about science.</p><p>Bible stories, prayer and Christian songs are blended into learning programmes. Teachers are becoming increasingly confident in using te reo MƒÅori and incorporate greetings, waiata and karakia at different times of the day. They are developing effective relationships with parents and whƒÅnau and value their input to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers are committed educators. They work as a team to plan and evaluate programmes, and share practice and their educational beliefs and philosophies. Teachers all contribute to centre leadership with the director‚Äôs guidance. They have good access to regular professional learning, and provisionally registered teachers are suitably supported by a mentor teacher from the Albany centre. These collaborative approaches are promoting a strong teaching team, and a positive culture.</p><p>The experienced director provides high quality governance and management that ensure the effective running of the centre. She has very good policies and procedures in place, and reviews these against actual practice. The director is evaluative, and has a very good understanding of self review as a mechanism for ongoing change and improvement. All self review includes teacher input, and parent views are sought and responded to when appropriate.</p><p>The director identifies appropriate next steps for the centre that include:</p><ul>
<li>considering how well teachers listen and respond to children‚Äôs learning needs and individual interests</li>
<li>promoting next steps for children that go beyond planned activities</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the centre‚Äôs bicultural curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reach Forward Early Learning Centre - Kaipara House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Reach Forward Early Learning Centre - Kaipara House will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
