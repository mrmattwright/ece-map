</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamariki Akoranga is an early childhood centre providing education and care for tamariki from birth to school age. It is a community service under the umbrella of the Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust, based on Whānau Ora support for the education, health and social needs of the community.</p><p>Tamariki Akoranga philosophy is intertwined with that of the Trust, which operates on kaupapa Māori theories and practices. The centre’s programme promotes bilingual education within <em>Te Whāriki</em>, New Zealand’s early childhood education curriculum.</p><p>The Trust and centre managers govern and lead a team of early childhood teachers who respect and are knowledgeable of te reo Māori and tikanga of mana whenua.</p><p>The May 2011 ERO report prompted a review of practice in assessment and of the routines used within the centre. These reviews contribute to a culture of ongoing improvement with positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Whānau are respected as the child’s first teachers and their aspirations are carefully listened to. Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Staff, including teachers and others employed at the centre support all children to develop a positive sense of belonging and self worth.</p><p>Children stand in their own mana. This comes from a strong, long-standing theoretical base clearly understood and celebrated by centre staff and the Trust. The centre philosophy is successfully implemented by all staff and this has a positive impact on children's learning. Adults share with them core and highly promoted values as a natural, integral part of centre life.</p><p>Children are assisted to lead activities to support their development as capable learners. These include participating enthusiastically in pōwhiri, whakatau, karakia, himene, waiata and kapa haka in authentic situations. Children are immersed in a bilingual culture where te reo Māori and English are spoken interchangeably by staff. Children respond using either language.</p><p>Children work and play in calm, pleasant surroundings where they can learn from each other, with a teacher or alone if they choose. Resources are easily accessed by children to help them make decisions. Children lead their learning, facilitated by staff who are attuned to noticing, recognising and responding to their education and care. They know children and their whānau well and respond to them appropriately.</p><p>Children's learning experiences are based on kaupapa Māori principles. Infants and toddlers are well catered for. Relationships across the centre are nurtured and valued to allow children, teachers, staff, trust members and whānau to contribute to each others' growth and development. Centre staff work collaboratively with community services within the Trust to provide extensive, streamlined support for whānau.</p><p>The transition to school programme, Wharekura, reflects the principles of <em>Te Whāriki.</em> It supports children to be confident in sharing their knowledge and learning with others.</p><p>All staff meaningfully participate in leading and facilitating professional developments within a collaborative culture. Decision making is shared so that teachers understand what is required to best support children to learn and progress. Significant progress has been made in developing sustainable, effective teaching practices. Leaders agree this is an area for continuing development.</p><p>The dual purposes of rigorous self review for improvement and for accountability are well understood by leaders and staff. A clear process is used that is well documented and with timelines and expected outcomes to benefit children.</p><p>Health and safety systems and processes are effectively implemented and checked. The Trust provides another layer of accountability and support.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation affirms that staff continue to implement the service’s self-identified next steps outlined in the strategic and annual plans. This includes a review of how effectively learning story assessments add value to children’s learning and ongoing work to strengthen teacher inquiry into the effectiveness of practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamariki Akoranga completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamariki Akoranga will be in four years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 March 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
