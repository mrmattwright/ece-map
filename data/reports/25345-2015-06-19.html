</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First steps Waiuku is licensed to provide education and care for 88 children, including 24 children up to two years of age. Children are catered for in three age-related groups in two buildings on the same site. The centre‚Äôs aim is to provide a warm, safe and friendly environment for children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The long serving centre manager has returned after an extended period of leave. Head teachers in the three rooms have responsibility for care routines and programme implementation. The centre operates as a part of Kidicorp Ltd. Professional and administrative direction is provided by a Kidicorp professional services manager and a business manager. Kidicorp provides operational frameworks, policies, support and guidance to develop and monitor centre practices.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the licence has been extended from 48 to 88 children and there have been changes in personnel. The centre has purchased a site next door and a new purpose-built facility will be built to cater for a planned further licence extension.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers see children as competent and capable and encourage them to be independent. Children show a sense of belonging in the centre. They benefit from positive, supportive relationships with teachers and each other. Children enjoy conversations with adults and other children.</p><p>Children in the preschool have opportunities to sustain their imaginative and collaborative play. They talk about their play and share their ideas confidently with each other and their teachers. The indoor and outdoor environments are attractive and invite children to explore freely and to build on their interests. Teachers in this area promote cooperation and engagement in learning experiences.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience close interactions with their teachers. They play in separate areas in one of the modified houses. Teachers respond well to these young children and they provide them with a variety of learning opportunities. Toddlers develop independence in their play and make choices about indoor and outdoor activities. Teachers find the outdoor spaces challenging to provide a stimulating environment for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Children‚Äôs literacy and mathematical skills are nurtured in the context of their play. Learning stories contain very good observations of children‚Äôs play, interests and developing dispositions. Online assessment portfolios provide whƒÅnau with opportunities to contribute information about their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Some teachers use te reo MƒÅori phrases and include tikanga MƒÅori very well in their practice and children participate confidently and enthusiastically. These teachers support colleagues to extend their knowledge and confidence in using te reo MƒÅori and to develop bicultural practices. The centre manager will continue to prioritise Treaty of Waitangi principles in the centre‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>Teachers help parents to familiarise their children with the centre when they enrol. They work together with parents to support children who are transitioning to rooms for older age groups. The centre has established relationships with a neighbouring school and shares information about starting school with parents. The centre manager plans to make connections with other schools in the local area.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers follow Kidicorp quality assurance processes to review centre practices. Continuing to strengthen teacher capability in self review could support the centre‚Äôs commitment to ongoing improvement and promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO managers have established appropriate goals for improvement that include:</p><ul>
<li>refurbishing the centre‚Äôs premises to provide improved learning environments for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>reviewing the programmes and resources provided for infants and toddlers to ensure they encourage children‚Äôs exploration and self-directed play</li>
<li>promoting greater complexity in older children‚Äôs play</li>
<li>planning strategically to manage the significant increase in licence numbers to ensure that positive outcomes for children are prioritised.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Waiuku completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Waiuku will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey <br>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
