</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Pahu Preschool Group is a non-profit, incorporated society, governed by an elected, volunteer executive committee. It is located west of Hamilton in the rural district of Te Pahu. The centre is licensed for 33 children over the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 40 children on the roll. The centre provides full-day sessions from Monday to Friday for children up to school age. Younger children attend until 1pm. The centre aims to provide a quality learning and care environment that motivates children to explore, build their confidence and follow their interests alongside qualified, registered teachers. The programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. A feature of the programme is the regular use of the local forest environment for children's learning.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report the centre has made good progress with the areas for development related to management and leadership structures, self review, appraisal, assessment and planning and te reo and tikanga Māori practices. Improvements include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a review and update of the constitution leading to clear roles and responsibilities for human resource management and related policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recently upgraded indoor and outdoor areas to enhance the facility for teachers, children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved systems and processes for self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthened assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers increased use of te reo and tikanga Māori practices during the sessions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As a result of changes in centre leadership, the executive committee have created a new position of centre manager to oversee professional leadership and day-to-day management of centre operations. The newly appointed centre manager is due to take up her role in November. An administrator contributes to the smooth running of the centre. Two new teachers have joined the teaching team since the 2013 ERO report. The service is committed to employing qualified and registered teachers. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Te Pahu Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>The centre enjoys strong support from the local community and reciprocal relationships with Te Pahu School. Families have worked cooperatively with a dedicated and well-qualified teaching team to establish and sustain a welcoming and caring environment for children. Strong and positive partnerships are evident where parents settle children to play, take time to read children's portfolios, centre displays, and engage in meaningful conversations with teachers about their children. This is contributing to a sense of wellbeing and belonging for families, children and teachers.</p><p>Children are confident to explore and experiment with a wide variety of interesting, readily accessible and good quality equipment and materials. Children explore early concepts of literacy and mathematics, and creatively use an interesting variety of tools for writing and for exploring mathematics concepts. They make choices and follow their interests in groups or as individuals. ERO observed children engaging in dramatic and imaginative play with their friends. They express themselves through opportunities to share their ideas and questions with their peers and interested teachers who know them well.</p><p>A feature of the centre programme is the weekly opportunities older children have to explore with teachers and parents in the nearby Kaniwhaniwha Bush reserve, and Pirongia Mountain area. This is contributing to their growing understanding of natural science and sustainability. The curriculum includes regular trips and excursions into the wider community and to places of local interest and visits from interested members of the community to share their skills such as beekeeping.</p><p>Celebrations of birthdays and significant special occasions provide focal points throughout the year. Flexible routines enable children to engage for long periods of time in activities of their choosing. There are age-appropriate, planned teacher-led experiences that are contributing to children's developing social skills. Teachers should consider reviewing the induction programme for families new to the centre. This process should include sharing knowledge about the culture of the service to help build parents' sense of belonging and ensure the ongoing sustainability of the service.</p><p>A strength of the service is the well-planned transition to school that includes reciprocal visits, detailed reports shared with new entrant teachers about children's strengths, interests and readiness for school, and inclusion in school celebrations and events.</p><p>Teachers have participated in professional development and an in-depth review of integrating bicultural perspectives into the curriculum. This has resulted in children's increasing confidence in the use of te reo Māori, respect for tikanga practices, and a growing appreciation and understanding of celebrations such as Matariki. There has been a recent focus on increasing resources that reflect Maori cultural values. Teachers and children have been welcomed onto Purekireki Marae, where kaumātua shared aspects of the history, stories and places of local significance. Children are learning about bicultural values, and Maori children are able to experience success as Maori.</p><p>The teaching team have established collegial and professional relationships. They are reflective practitioners with a shared philosophy that is focused on positive outcomes for children, and developing meaningful partnerships with families. They meet regularly to plan and assess children's learning, and document this in detailed reports and profile books for children and families to share the learning. They engage in professional conversations, willingly participate in regular and relevant professional development, and undertake effective self review. There is a culture of shared leadership amongst the staff. Models of good teaching practice observed by ERO were:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategies that promote children's confidence to explore, experiment and make mistakes as important learning experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skilful settling of children as they arrive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying children's special needs and working positively with specialist agencies to support equitable and inclusive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>noticing and following children's interests to foster their love of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enthusiastic, ongoing participation in relevant professional learning and development.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leadership has undergone some changes and challenges in recent times. The acting supervisor has ensured continuity for children and families through her experienced and dedicated leadership. She regularly provides informative reports on many important aspects of centre organisation. She models best practice in early childhood for the teaching team and is providing effective mentoring and support for a teacher undergoing teacher registration. The centre administrator provides effective and efficient leadership and valued support for teachers and the management committee.</p><p>The executive committee are effectively governing the centre through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a clear, shared and regularly reviewed philosophy and vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a recently reviewed and updated constitution resulting in clear roles and responsibilities for members and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriate policies, guidelines and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detailed and well-aligned strategic and annual plans that focus on meeting the intent of the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective self review that leads to ongoing development and improvement of the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The executive committee access appropriate external advice to support them to keep up to date with regulatory requirements and participate in training for their roles. Through effective governance they have placed the centre in a good position to sustain the service in the community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that useful next steps for centre development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to review and strengthen human resource management systems and processes to ensure they align with current New Zealand Education Council expectations and other legislative requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the opportunities for older children and active learners to add complexity to their learning and take further leadership roles in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently implement strategies to positively guide and engage children in the learning process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Pahu Preschool Group completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Pahu Preschool Group will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>16 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
