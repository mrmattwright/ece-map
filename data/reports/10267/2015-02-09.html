</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jump Start Kids in Mt Albert, Auckland, is one of two centres that is privately owned and operated by Early Childhood Education Ltd. The centre offers sessional and full-day care and education and is licensed for 90 children, including a maximum of 25 children under two years of age. Children come from a number of cultural backgrounds and some have English as an additional language.</p><p>Owners oversee the operational and administration aspects of the service. Since taking ownership of the centre in 2008, its two licences have been merged into one and centre owners have received positive ERO reports.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review significant work has taken place. The centre‚Äôs two-storey building has been renovated. The large upstairs space provides a work area for teachers‚Äô use and serves as an office for administrative purposes. The ground floor is divided in to three separate rooms providing care and education for babies and children up to school age. A new learning space has been developed for preschool children and the outdoor playground has been upgraded, resulting in better indoor and outdoor flow.</p><p>All teachers are registered and some are long serving members of staff. Other staff members include the centre cook, a receptionist and student teachers. A coordinator in each room manages the daily programmes and mentors teachers by modelling good practice.</p><p>Robust policies and procedures guide centre practices. The centre‚Äôs clear philosophy and vision promote children‚Äôs learning and are evident in teaching practices. The philosophy is closely linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is respected as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and a focus on developing a bicultural curriculum is evident in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers promote children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning effectively. Children are confident and competent learners. They work collaboratively with each other and play and explore the environment together.</p><p>Children settle quickly and show trust in adults. Teachers are ethnically diverse and reflect the diversity of the children enrolled. This contributes to a sense of belonging and ownership for children and their families. Leadership opportunities are promoted, particularly for older children in the preschool programme. Teachers encourage children and provide experiences to promote their social competence. Children learn strategies to problem solve, negotiate and take turns, as they make purposeful choices in their play.</p><p>Teachers responsible for infants and toddlers programme have been selected for this specialised area of learning and care. Their approaches promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers have a good understanding of aroha, and are compassionate and respectful to children. They provide resources that encourage children‚Äôs language development and exploration. The environment is calm and slow paced, giving younger children space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>The teaching team are developing a bicultural curriculum. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori in the context of children‚Äôs play and promote aspects of tikanga MƒÅori within the daily programme. Visual displays in centre rooms reflect and value children‚Äôs cultural diversity. Teachers could now use self review as a tool for monitoring and further developing the effectiveness of the bicultural programme they provide for children.</p><p>The physical environment is stimulating and supports children‚Äôs learning. The programme is child focused while also including some planned themes that enable children and staff to celebrate various cultural events in the community.</p><p>Teachers are friendly and positively respond to parents aspirations. Parents interviewed by ERO express their appreciation of centre staff, who they describe as genuinely caring and helpful. These parents are well informed of what is happening for their children. They can approach staff for support or further discussion. Open approaches such as these promote good centre/whƒÅnau partnerships</p><p>The owners have a clear vision that sets the direction of the centre. They are committed to ensuring that teachers are supported to provide children with high quality early childhood learning experiences. The teacher appraisal process is effective and is monitored to see how well it brings about positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order for children to continue enjoying successful learning through play, leaders agree that teachers could further improve outcomes for children through:</p><ul>
<li>using open questioning techniques more often with children to challenge their thinking</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for children to contribute to planning and making decisions in the programme</li>
<li>strengthening records of assessment, planning and evaluation for every child, so that they become a more useful record of the individual child‚Äôs learning journey and teachers‚Äô partnerships with whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><p>It could also be beneficial for centre owners and coordinators to work with teachers to put in place an annual work plan that formally documents key actions for meeting centre goals and staff reflections on the effectiveness of actions taken.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jump Start Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO and the owners discussed the importance of maintaining Police vets for every person working in the centre who is not a registered teacher.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jump Start Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
