</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei o te K≈çp≈´ is located the grounds of TƒÅhuna Marae on the Awhitu peninsula, near Waiuku township. The puna reo opened in 2008 and is a NgƒÅti te Ata initiative. It is part of an iwi 20year plan for early childhood education and builds on a series of longstanding NgƒÅti te Ata education traditions.</p><p>The iwi plan focuses on the revitalisation of te reo o NgƒÅti te Ata and on providing high quality educational experiences and outcomes for its tamariki and whƒÅnau. Iwi aspirations for a learning centre were expressed in 1854 and the vision of a ‚Äòchildhood assembly‚Äô, where children rise to their potential, was later articulated by King Mahuta. This vision is encapsulated in the name Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei. These strong historical, iwi and community foundations are important features of this puna reo.</p><p>The puna reo was established by Te K≈çp≈´ Incorporated, after extensive consultation with kaumƒÅtua, the community and whƒÅnau. Iwi, the marae and whƒÅnau are represented in governance and management. Leadership roles in the puna relate to iwi liaison, te reo me ≈çna tikanga, and professional teaching practice. Two kaiako are provisionally registered teachers, three are studying towards early childhood education qualifications and two hold k≈çhanga reo certificates.</p><p>Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei programmes are underpinned by the iwi curriculum and assessment framework, NgƒÅ MƒÅtƒÅpuna o NgƒÅti te Ata, and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The puna also draws on a variety of MƒÅori traditions, pedagogies and frameworks for its philosophy of teaching and learning, and for its operations, consultation and self review.</p><p>This is ERO‚Äôs first review of Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei o te K≈çp≈´.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Whakawhanaungatanga is a feature of Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei o te K≈çp≈´. A variety of successful strategies has been used to engage whƒÅnau in extending their own learning and in developing programmes for tamariki. WhƒÅnau have been involved in the development of the puna reo and an ongoing partnership with whƒÅnau is both a strength and a goal of the puna.</p><p>A playgroup meets in a building in the puna grounds. It offers an opportunity for children from the community and their whƒÅnau to develop connections with the puna whƒÅnau and to become involved in the education kaupapa. The playgroup illustrates a focus on building capability and supports the sustainability of Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei. Kaiako and kaiƒÅrahi know tamariki and their whƒÅnau very well.</p><p>Tamariki are immersed in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga o NgƒÅti te Ata and are exposed to good quality language in meaningful everyday situations. Teachers have undertaken an in-depth review of their strategies for supporting tamariki to become capable communicators in te reo MƒÅori, and have established processes for monitoring and building on progress. Although their levels and use of te reo vary, tamariki have good levels of understanding of te reo and respond readily. Some whƒÅnau are actively building their use of te reo to support their tamariki.</p><p>Tamariki are very well supported to develop a strong sense of identity, belonging and connectedness, both in Te KƒÅhui Iti Nei and at TƒÅhuna Marae. Kaiako make good use of the marae setting and the surrounding grounds to extend children‚Äôs learning and creativity in a variety of areas, including tikanga and kaitiakitanga. Tamariki support kaik≈çrero at the marae with waiata learnt at the puna. Tuakana/teina relationships support learning in the puna.</p><p>Tamariki also have good opportunities to use and experiment with information communication technologies (ICT) to support their learning. They learn about their place in the wider world and how they can make a contribution to help others. Literacy and numeracy learning is included in children‚Äôs activities in meaningful ways.</p><p>Programmes develop around, and are extended over time according to, children‚Äôs strengths and evolving interests. Kaiako keep informative assessment records for individual children that reflect this approach. Assessment, planning and evaluation practices focus on learning outcomes for children, using ngƒÅ mƒÅtƒÅpuna and the goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Whakapapa connections and whƒÅnau relationships and aspirations are an integral part of assessment and planning.</p><p>Pou ƒÅrahi is a strength in the puna reo. The benefits of strong leadership and modelling in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga o NgƒÅti te Ata and in early childhood teaching practice are increasingly evident. Effective leadership is particularly apparent in records of in-depth, collaborative self review. This review is research based and clearly linked with the iwi strategic vision. There is a well established culture of reflection and review that is focused on improving both kaiako practice and outcomes for tamariki and their whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>KaiƒÅrahi plan to continue building the capabilities of kaiako in both te reo and early childhood education practices using ongoing professional development and current self-review processes. Improvements in the outdoor learning environment are planned and a review of indoor areas has begun. Improving the layout and resourcing of play areas should be a priority and will help kaiako to:</p><ul>
<li>increase children‚Äôs independent access to a wide selection of good quality equipment and creative materials</li>
<li>provide a more interesting, inviting and challenging environment to foster children‚Äôs decision making, creative thinking and problem solving</li>
<li>engage tamariki in more varied and complex conversations to extend their use of te reo to express their ideas and work collaboratively with others.</li>
</ul><p>More specific links between policies, procedures and the 2008 early childhood regulations and licensing criteria would support ongoing rigour in the existing good processes for policy review. Teachers‚Äô appraisal and registration processes should be aligned with the criteria for registered teachers. It would be worthwhile to use existing contacts with professional expertise in early childhood education for support in these areas.</p><p>KaiƒÅrahi could also consider more clearly linking reports to the governance board with annual and long-term plans in order to show incremental progress and next steps towards achieving broader strategic goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kahui Iti Nei o Te Kopu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kahui Iti Nei o Te Kopu will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
