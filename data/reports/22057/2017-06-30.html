</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whangaparaoa Playcentre operates as a family cooperative as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association. The centre caters for 30 children including 15 up to two years of age and is open for five mixed-age sessions per week, one of which is a nature session with regular excursions outside the centre.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children. Sessions are guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. There is an expectation that te reo and tikanga Māori will be included during sessions. Recently the Association has undertaken to make professional development available, to support centre members in learning and using New Zealand Sign Language.</p><p>The North Shore Playcentre Association manages centres’ funding and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage their centres and to provide good quality educational programmes for children. The national Playcentre organisation is currently undergoing restructure. There will be a new regional manager and new centre support roles.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report centre members have supported each other to undertake Playcentre adult education. While there have been changes in centre membership, whānau have continued to provide good quality programmes for children. Most members are currently enrolled in courses to improve their Playcentre training levels.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring, respectful relationships between families and children contribute to the sense of community and shared purpose in the centre. There is a strong focus on the emotional and physical wellbeing of adults and children. The centre has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. All contributions are valued and everyone's point of view is considered through consensus decision making.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They have fun and are confident, eager learners who develop friendships with others. Children engage in cooperative play, make choices and can explore and learn at their own pace. Toddlers are encouraged to explore, try things out and make discoveries. Older children have leadership opportunities that include care of their belongings and supporting younger children. Adults engage children in sustained conversations and encourage them to share their thoughts and ideas.They respect and provide for the specific characteristics of infants well.</p><p>Whānau plan and implement a curriculum that is focused on children learning through play. They provide an attractive, well-resourced environment. Adults encourage children to be creative and engage in a wide variety of art, dance, and music activities. They support children to learn about literacy, mathematics science and technology concepts in meaningful ways.</p><p>Centre members have developed good systems to manage the centre and keep other members involved and informed. They are highly supportive of each other in their role as first educators of their children and eager to engage in Playcentre education. Vibrant wall displays help centre members plan and provide exciting play experiences for children. Experienced members support newer people in understanding processes for assessment, planning and evaluation. Children's assessment portfolios are valued and show their involvement in the programme. Some have stories written in the child's home language<em>.</em></p><p>Centre members work supportively as a cohesive group. They are enthusiastic and motivated to provide good quality education for all children attending. Experienced members strongly support emergent leadership. Members appreciate the very good support they have received from North Shore Playcentre Association. Internal evaluation is established and child focused, and centre members agree they could strengthen this process<em>.</em></p><p>The Association management team have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and having a bicultural partnership with whānau Māori. This commitment is evident in Association operations and in the support provided for centres. Adults’ and children’s familiarity with te reo and tikanga Māori is encouraged. Centre members look for ways to include te ao Māori throughout the programme. They are keen to continue to strengthen their bicultural practices.</p><p>The Association provides effective governance and management structures for the centres. There are good systems in place to monitor the quality of sessions, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements. The management team demonstrates the professional leadership necessary to help the centres respond to change, including the restructure of the national Playcentre organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluate how effectively all children's home languages and cultural identities are celebrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the visibility of learning and continuity in assessment, planning and evaluation documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation to more clearly show adults' evaluative thinking, research and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To help enhance practices in all North Shore Playcentres, new regional support personnel should consider ways to support members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase their bicultural understanding and integration of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve their understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool to guide and improve practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whangaparaoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whangaparaoa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>30 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
