</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bombay Playcentre is a well-established, parent-lead early childhood education service. It is situated next to Bombay School and offers group-supervised, general sessions for up to 30 children from birth to school age. Extended sessions for older children are provided as needed. These sessions are planned and overseen by employed supervisors.</p><p>Through the philosophy centre members aim to provide a safe and caring environment for children to play and learn, and for whānau to find friendship and support, growing together as part of the Bombay community.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 centres in the Counties Playcentre Association (CPA). The New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) and the CPA provide governance oversight for the centre. This includes strategic direction, management support, documentation and adult education programmes. In addition, the centre receives regular visits from experienced personnel who offer advice guidance and support to centre members. The NZPF is currently undergoing restructuring, and this has implications for CPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review identified key next steps in relation to, provision for infants and toddlers, parent training levels and long-term planning for centre development. Centre members have given particular consideration to these areas through targeted self review, resulting in significant progress.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy forms the basis of relationships and the curriculum. Centre members give clear priority to establishing positive, respectful and reciprocal relationships with each family. They have created a welcoming and inclusive culture that is responsive to children's individual preferences and needs. A strong sense of wellbeing and belonging is demonstrated by children and their families.</p><p>An effective, shared model for leadership underpins centre operations. Members are involved, well supported to engage in training, and take on leadership roles that contribute to quality education and the life of the centre. Members have clearly identified priorities and plans that contribute to sustainability of the playcentre. Parent engagement in playcentre training, coupled with support and mentoring from experienced members is enhancing their knowledge of children's learning and educational theories in the context of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Shared and collaborative leadership and training is resulting in common understandings and expectations for promoting positive learning outcomes for children and adults.</p><p>Self review is well developed and informs ongoing improvement and centre direction. Planned reviews ensure that all aspects of the playcentre are evaluated in a systematic way. Findings are well analysed and acted on to improve experiences and outcomes for children and families. In response to ERO's 2013 report centre members undertook specific self review in relation to babies and toddlers. This review has resulted in strengthened curriculum provision and more deliberate inclusion of these very young learners.</p><p>Children's play and exploration are promoted as valued learning. Children are confident and trusted by adults to follow interests, freely explore and contribute to their own and others learning. Parents are fully engaged alongside children, supporting and extending learning through listening, role modelling and asking open questions. High levels of cooperative learning among children and adults supports children's growing view of themselves as confident decision makers and successful learners.</p><p>Children benefit from a highly functional and rich learning environment. All areas of play are well represented. They are thoughtfully planned and presented in ways that respond to and motivate children's interests and curiosity. Careful attention is paid to ensure equitable access and learning opportunities for all children. Children enjoy extensive possibilities to follow an interest, set their own challenges and achievements.</p><p>The centre has well-developed procedures and practices for assessment, planning and evaluation. Useful assessment tools, shared contributions and support for members are resulting in meaningful assessment, planning and evaluation for individual and groups of children. Portfolios compile valuable records of children's interests, dispositions and continuity of learning over time. This approach to assessment for learning is enabling parents and other adults to understand and build on each child's learning pathway.</p><p>Bicultural awareness and practices are developing well. Centre members demonstrate a commitment to using te reo Māori in sessions, learning about and including significant events and celebrations. Parents are supporting their children to gain an appreciation and understanding of the Māori language and culture, and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa.</p><p>Centre members have established positive relationships with the adjacent primary school. Playcentre children have many opportunities to become familiar with the school environment and routines, and to form relationships with teachers and children. Open and reciprocal sharing between the playcentre and school provides a sound foundation for strengthening the continuity of children's learning as they enter school. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The following next steps have been identified through the centre's self review and ERO's evaluation.</p><p>Centre members will continue to grow individual member's knowledge, confidence and capability to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understand the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show continuity and development of children's learning in assessment records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently use session evaluations to support continuity of planning and learning from session to session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>naturally use and promote te reo and aspects of tikanga Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that CPA:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develops strategies to ensure that its centre members are kept up-to-date with obligations and expectations in relation to current regulatory requirements and policies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bombay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><p>To improve practice the association and centre members should ensure that all policies and documents are current, relevant and consistently implemented.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal for employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, document and implement an annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>secure heavy objects that might fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>record accidents and incidents to eliminate hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>record risk assessment for excursions.</p>
</li>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
