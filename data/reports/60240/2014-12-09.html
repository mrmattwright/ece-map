</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Raumati is one of five Kidicorp centres on the Kapiti Coast. It is licensed for up to 44 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Māori children make up a high proportion of the roll (20%). The centre is divided into three age-specific rooms, with access for all between the areas.</p><p>Staff are well qualified with some long-serving teachers who know the community and children well.</p><p>Since the April 2012 ERO report, the centre has reviewed its philosophy. This is underpinned by shared values and beliefs and has been reviewed collaboratively.</p><p>ABC Raumati has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of ABC Raumati provides clear direction and guidelines for the promotion of positive outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers, through their practice, foster the centre’s philosophy to be a “home away from home”.</p><p>Children are well supported to become self-reliant and independent learners. Positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children are maintained. They play and learn in a calm and well organised environment. Collaborative ways of working are promoted through leadership and a culture where children are valued and affirmed as individuals and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>High quality teaching practices are evident. Adults know the children well. They follow children’s interests and ask questions to allow them to lead their learning. Children learn through experience and, with teacher facilitation, develop their thinking. They are highly engaged in their learning as individuals and in groups.</p><p>Children engage in a creative, explorative learning environment and they are encouraged to interact, take on roles and develop relationships with others through their play. The centre is well resourced. The newly developed outside area offers challenge and interest that invites children to explore and become involved in a wide range of activities. Flexible routines support children’s needs and rhythms. Local community resources are used to enhance learning.</p><p>The centre curriculum is well designed. Ongoing observations of children build a picture of what they are interested in and can do. These observations provide a basis for decisions about the programme. Teachers respond meaningfully to infants’, toddlers’ and young children’s interests and needs. There are many appropriate opportunities for children to develop and explore literacy and mathematics. Teachers should consider how the curriculum can better cater for children with additional learning needs and how they can strengthen culturally responsive teaching strategies.</p><p>Children’s journals document assessment information and next steps for learning. These are attractively displayed to encourage children to share learning with their families. Teachers should further develop the links between assessment and planning to provide more complex learning for children.</p><p>Te ao Māori is visible in the centre. Teachers are currently involved in training to incorporate the goals of <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> in their planning and practice. Strategies to support Māori success as Māori are acknowledged by the centre as requiring continuing development.</p><p>Transitions to school processes have been further developed. Four-year-old children have opportunities to learn together during the <em>Be School Ready</em> programme. Transitioning between learning spaces for younger and older children is supported through tuakana teina practices and the access between areas in the centre.</p><p>The centre is welcoming to all children and their parents and whānau. Partnerships in learning are encouraged and nurtured. The newly implemented electronic <em>Story Park</em> provides parents and whānau with increased ways of contributing to their children’s learning.</p><p>The Kidicorp organisation provides sound governance, guidance and support for the centre. Sustainable practices for leaders and teachers are developed through training and professional development. Appraisal systems are robust, supportive, developmental and focused on centre goals, personal development and learning outcomes for children. The policy framework is responsive to this centre. Health and safety are given priority.</p><p>There is a strong focus and expectation for continual improvement through self review. This involves consultation with parents, whānau and staff and is used to inform decision making, professional learning programmes, plans and actions. Goals and priorities are linked to positive learning outcomes for children and these are evaluated regularly to measure progress against the goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers are committed to ongoing improvement. They have appropriately identified areas for development. The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue strengthening assessment and planning of children’s learning</li>
<li>further develop and implement the centre’s plan of success for Māori as Māori</li>
<li>strengthen culturally responsive teaching strategies in order to recognise and affirm children's cultures.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Raumati completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Raumati will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>9 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
