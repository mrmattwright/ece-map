<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre programme promotes positive outcomes for children. Centre leaders recognise, however, that improvements in management and administration are needed to sustain good practices and support ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Small Kauri Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned education and care service for up to 37 children, including seven up to two years of age. The centre occupies a modified facility near the Mangere Bridge shopping centre. The current owner established the centre and has operated it for 11 years. The centre was recently relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Education Regulations.</p><p>The centre provides a family-like environment for children of mixed ages. The children are caring of one another and enjoy positive relationships with the staff. There has been little change in the staff since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review. Of the ten qualified teachers on the staff, six are fully registered.</p><p>Previous ERO reviews have commented positively on the programme for children and have made recommendations for improving management planning and self review.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The child-centred learning philosophy of the owner and the head teacher is clearly evident. The programme reflects <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Children benefit from the unstructured and unhurried pace of the programme. Routines are kept to a minimum so that children&rsquo;s play is not frequently interrupted. Caring and respectful relationships between adults and children nurture children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Parents and wh&#257;nau value the service. They regularly share their children&rsquo;s interests and backgrounds. As a result, staff know children and families well. Teachers share information about children&rsquo;s development with one another. They support children&rsquo;s progress and extend their play through conversation and questioning. Children&rsquo;s progress and development is well documented and celebrated.</p><p>The programme is inclusive. Children with identified special needs are well supported. Centre staff consult parents and wh&#257;nau informally. Managers make good use of external agencies that help teachers to provide support for children and their families. Parents are invited to share information about their children&rsquo;s interests and family backgrounds. Teachers use opportunities to develop their skills in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and are developing good processes for supporting partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Children select equipment to set up and sustain their own play. Staff respond to children&rsquo;s ideas and interests rather than directing their play. Children use resources in ways that extend their learning and encourage problem solving. A key focus for centre leaders is developing high quality interactions that support children to become capable and confident learners.</p><p>Other strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for reading and writing as part of children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>indoor and outdoor resources and facilities that encourage active play</li>
<li>painting, music and construction resources that prompt creative play.</li>
</ul><p>Children make friends and develop good social skills. They play confidently both independently and in small groups. Staff help children to resolve differences and to express their ideas and feelings verbally. As a result, children are happy and busy throughout the day and are actively engaged in the programme.</p><p>The mixed age programme works effectively. Babies and toddlers are well cared for by staff and older children. They have activities designed to engage and interest them. Older children are also provided with appropriate activities, including a transition to school programme.</p><p>The high number of qualified teachers is a positive feature of the service. Teachers have relevant professional development opportunities and are encouraged to reflect on their practice. The focus on building relationships and partnerships with families and wh&#257;nau has strengthened teachers&rsquo; understanding of how to help parents to support their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>Areas that are currently in need of development and review are similar to those recommended by ERO in 2009. Most relate to improvements needed in centre management and administration. Key areas for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a planning process that identifies long-term and annual management goals</li>
<li>updating and documenting centre policies and procedures to provide consistent guidelines for centre operations</li>
<li>using a self-review framework to evaluate centre practices and progress towards goals</li>
<li>implementing a teacher appraisal process to help teachers improve their practice.</li>
</ul><p>The re-designed appraisal system is aligned to the Registered Teacher Criteria. The appraisal system could also reflect the centre&rsquo;s professional development focus and teachers&rsquo; own goals.</p><p>The licensee and supervisor agree that it would be useful to seek the support of an external facilitator in addressing these areas. Improved planning and self review would enable centre leaders to take strategic and systematic steps to raise the quality and sustainability of centre management.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Small Kauri Early Childhood Ed Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the staff should consistently implement centre policies such as:</p><ul>
<li>identifying, minimising or removing hazards in the centre environment</li>
<li>documenting procedures for evacuating the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The service provider must implement processes to comply with licensing criteria related to management planning, performance appraisal and self review.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
