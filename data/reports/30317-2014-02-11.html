</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Busy Time Matamata is a privately owned education and care service catering for children from 3 months to school age. It is located in a house that has been converted for early childhood education purposes. There are 47 children enrolled, of whom 9 are under two years of age, and 2 are identified as MƒÅori. The service operates as a mixed-age centre, with teachers rostered to provide appropriate supervision of the routines and programme.</p><p>One of the joint owners works full time as the centre manager responsible for employment, finance and operational management. The other owner, who is a registered early childhood teacher, provides support for the curriculum. She also provides part-time mentoring and professional advice and guidance for teachers involved in completing qualifications and registration. Teachers share many of the responsibilities of professional leadership and centre management.</p><p>The centre philosophy includes an emphasis on children having fun as they learn and develop their social skills, relationships and confidence. Tuakana-teina relationships are important features that underpin the mixed-age programme, and teachers are continuing to develop their competence and confidence in the integration of Te Ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The owners responded positively to recommendations in the 2011 ERO review, and have been engaged in a sustained external programme of advice and guidance. The focus of this contract has been on the review of the service philosophy, strategic plan, and strategies to develop children‚Äôs social competencies. Currently, centre managers and teachers are involved in professional development and self review of curriculum planning and assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive and responsive relationships with teachers and other children. They demonstrate confident, active engagement in routines and activities. Children are encouraged to make choices and to take responsibility for themselves and each another. Teachers are skilled at using positive guidance strategies to enhance children‚Äôs interpersonal relationships. Children have a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The environment promotes a family-like atmosphere. Teachers prepare inside and outside play areas to invite children‚Äôs exploration, discovery and physical challenge. Children have access to a wide range of age-appropriate resources. Teachers interact with children to support and extend their learning and play through active listening and questioning that provokes thoughtful responses. In addition, visits to the local community enrich children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers share information from observations to develop individual plans that respond to children‚Äôs emergent strengths. Early literacy is strongly promoted through extended conversations and frequent use of books and art activities. Aspects of mathematics are integrated into everyday learning experiences. Older children and their parents are well supported and informed as they prepare for the transition to school.</p><p>Children up to two years of age experience physical challenge and social interactions with others. They have opportunities to safely explore and become familiar with the world around them. Teachers are nurturing and respond promptly to these children‚Äôs physical and emotional needs.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to plan the programme and environment to provide rich learning opportunities for individuals and groups of children. They prepare well-illustrated portfolios for each child to record their learning experiences. Teachers are reflective practitioners, who continually discuss the effectiveness of their practice and possible improvements. These evaluation processes could be further strengthened by making explicit links to the centre philosophy and intended educational outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre manager provides well-documented policies and guidelines for all aspects of operations. While he encourages professional learning for teachers, performance management should be reviewed and strengthened. Strategic and operational plans are used to guide centre development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that areas for ongoing development include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to embed the curriculum based on children‚Äôs interests and strengths</li>
<li>reviewing the implications of the intended curriculum for centre and resource organisation</li>
<li>the meaningful and consistent integration of Te Ao MƒÅori into the programme</li>
<li>a robust performance management system for personnel at all levels of the service.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Busy Time Matamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Busy Time Matamata will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 February 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
