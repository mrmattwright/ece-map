</table><p>An urgent priority for this service is to establish a team culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Centre leaders and teaching staff have a number of improvements to be made to raise the quality of education and care provided for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>I Kids Kaiwharawhara is a privately-owned education and care service. The centre is licensed for 72 children, including 35 up to the age of two years. Full-time education and care is offered across three playrooms.</p><p>This service was recently purchased by the Evolve Education Group. The regional and the centre manager, and one of the two team leaders, are new to their roles. The centre manager has overall responsibility for day-to-day operations. Two team leaders support teachers in their roles and have oversight of the curriculum. Many staff have found the change-management process resulting from new ownership unsettling. </p><p>This is the service’s first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a free-play programme and select resources from the activities provided. Teachers are warm and welcoming.</p><p>Children’s portfolios have regular and informative entries which highlight their involvement in the programme and developing friendships.</p><p>Self review is developing and is at times focused on improvement and used by teachers to reflect on practice.</p><p>ERO’s evaluation identified that several improvements are required to raise the quality of education and care provided for children. To realise the centre’s philosophy and aspirations for children’s learning, centre leaders and teachers should collectively determine what high quality practice looks like for the curriculum. Once determined, these indicators of good practice will be useful in measuring how well current practices align to these expectations through self-review and evaluation processes.</p><p>The teaching team is currently reviewing the philosophy to assist them to develop shared understandings of practice. Consideration of raising the quality of planning, assessment and the learning environment is necessary through this process. As part of this review it is important that leaders consult with whānau.</p><p>Teachers take a strong supervisory role and do not yet provide a responsive and challenging curriculum for infants, toddlers or young children. A key next step is for them to work and play alongside children. They should notice their interests and use appropriate teaching strategies and resources to support and extend each child’s learning. In addition, it is important for infants to have access indoors to equipment that they can use to develop their large motor skills.</p><p>Teachers should be supported to further develop their understanding of the cycle of planning and how this contributes to a group planning focus, curriculum design, responsive teaching practices and assessment for learning.</p><p>In order for teachers to provide an individualised programme of learning for children, assessment information should:</p><ul>
<li>be analysed in depth to show the actual learning occurring for each child</li>
<li>show how teachers have added challenge and complexity to learning</li>
<li>promote continuity of learning to better highlight progress over time</li>
<li>celebrate each child’s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should implement the expectations identified in Evolve Education Group’s culture and identity policy. This provides clear expectations for the implementation of a bicultural curriculum that honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>Consulting with whānau Māori and Pacific families to define success for their children in the centre context, has been identified by leaders as a key next step. </p><p>Further developing teachers’ understanding of the self-review process and building their capacity to evaluate is necessary for improving practice. Improvements to self review and evaluation processes should provide leaders with better information to judge the effectiveness of centre operations and practice, and inform future decision making.</p><p>Build leaders' capacity to develop teachers' competence and strengthen the focus on continual improvement is a priority. The new appraisal model should support this approach when it is implemented. Once established, it is important that leaders assess whether it is supporting teachers to improve their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a cohesive team approach focused on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>review the philosophy and develop clear indicators of quality practice</li>
<li>provide a responsive and challenging curriculum</li>
<li>improve teachers’ understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>develop a clear process for internal evaluation and strengthen the evaluative aspect of review</li>
<li>implement a bicultural curriculum reflective of Evolve Education Group’s guiding policy</li>
<li>consult with Māori and Pacific families to define success for their children in this educational context.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of I Kids Kaiwharawhara completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>acknowledgement and reflection of Māori as tangata whenua in the curriculum</li>
<li>provision of a range of experiences to enhance and extend children’s learning and development.                 </li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C5, C9]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of I Kids Kaiwharawhara will be within two years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 October 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in <a href="file:///S:/all_ero/REPORTS/INCOMING/Enter Into Trim/importBatch23122015/J25174 - 46196.docx#_General_Information_about">SECTION 3</a> of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
