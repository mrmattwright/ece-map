</table><p>The No 1 Kindy Limited¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The No 1 Kindy is a well-established early learning centre in Takapuna, Auckland. It is licensed for 34 children, including up to 12 under two years of age. The centre offers full-day education and care in a mixed-age group programme.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It emphasises the values of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, tuakana/teina, and fostering trusting relationships with children and their whƒÅnau. This is underpinned by a strong commitment to biculturalism and child-led play.</p><p>Centre staff consist of the experienced owner, who manages the centre, and 10 registered teachers. Most of the teachers are long-standing members of staff.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. Positive features identified in the 2014 ERO report have been maintained. These include children having a sense of belonging, strong relationships with whƒÅnau, a responsive programme, and well-developed internal evaluation. Leaders and teachers have worked purposefully to progress next steps and recommendations regarding strategic goal setting and refining the evaluation of group programmes.</p><p>The centre is part of the Pupuke (Westlake) Community of Learning |KƒÅhui Ako (CoL).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive high quality care and education. The centre's calm and positive tone helps children settle quickly into the programme. Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre environment. Their wellbeing is nurtured through respectful relationships with teachers and each other.</p><p>Children are supported well to become sociable, articulate and confident learners. They play cooperatively with, and alongside their peers for sustained periods of time. Children benefit from playing in mixed age groups. Their imagination and creativity is fostered during free play. Teachers provide good quality resources. The indoor and outdoor environments enable children to explore, experience challenges and revisit prior learning.</p><p>Teachers provide nurturing and respectful care for infants and toddlers using primary caregiving practises. Children benefit from good adult-to-child ratios. This means that their individual preference and care routines can be met. Teachers respond well to infants' early attempts at verbalisation. They use effective strategies to develop toddlers' oral language.</p><p>Children's transitions into, through and beyond the kindergarten are effective and very well managed. Connections with local primary schools and the kƒÅhui ako have enabled teachers to support families as they enrol and transition their children to school.</p><p>Teachers' planning and assessment is highly responsive to children's diverse learning needs and interests. Literacy, numeracy and science are well integrated into play. Teachers know the children well, and effectively scaffold and extend their learning. They encourage positive social interactions and tuakana/teina relationships. Teachers foster children's independence and self-management skills as part of daily learning. Children are empowered to take responsibility for themselves, their peers and the group.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to te ao MƒÅori. Bicultural practices and a respect for te ao MƒÅori are woven through the programme. Teachers naturally and confidently integrate te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia into daily practice.</p><p>Children benefit from strong partnerships between parents and teachers. There are many opportunities for leaders, teachers, parents and whƒÅnau to work collaboratively to support positive outcomes for children. Teachers value whƒÅnau contribution to the programme.</p><p>The centre's leadership is highly effective. Leaders have high expectations of staff and for children's learning. They promote collaboration and support staff wellbeing. Staff have opportunities for professional growth through well-targeted internal and external professional development. Leaders foster teachers' leadership.</p><p>Centre development is guided by high quality internal evaluation and strategic priorities. There is strong alignment between strategic priorities, staff appraisals and internal evaluation. The centre has good systems in place to monitor health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have used internal evaluation to identify relevant priorities for development that include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meaningfully include MƒÅori values in teaching practice and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine appraisal processes to align with the Teaching Council's new standards.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The No 1 Kindy Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
