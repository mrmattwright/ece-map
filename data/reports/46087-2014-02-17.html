</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five Vardon has been owned by Kidicorp Ltd. since March 2013. It is located in Te Rapa, Hamilton in facilities that have recently been extensively renovated. This service was licensed in September 2013 to cater for up to 50 children, including eight children under the age of two years. The centre is intending to become a service for children over the age of two years. In preparation for this, the areas for under-two and over-two year old children have been merged into one mixed-age service. There are 37 children enrolled of whom 10 are identified as MƒÅori. The centre operates under the ownership and management of Kidicorp Ltd, a national early childhood education and care provider.</p><p>The centre manager took up his responsibilities in July 2013. The head teacher and the majority of staff at the centre have remained the same through two recent changes of ownership. Kidicorp Ltd. provides sound advice and support for professional services, financial management, and quality assurance processes through qualified personnel, who make frequent visits to the centre. In keeping with Kidicorp policy the service maintains a higher than expected number of qualified and in-training teachers to work with children.</p><p>The philosophy has been developed through an inclusive consultation process. It expresses the intention to work in collaboration with families to benefit children, uphold Treaty of Waitangi principles, and provide children with knowledge about their bicultural heritage.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of this centre under this licence.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience affirming and respectful relationships with each other and adults. This contributes to a calm and settled environment where children are confident and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Children‚Äôs ideas and contributions are sought and valued. This contribution was evident during the planning stage for the new outside area. Children‚Äôs self-help skills are promoted through familiar routines and opportunities to make choices and decisions about their learning.</p><p>Children under two years of age are included in all aspects of centre activities. They are confident explorers and enjoy ready access to a wide variety of equipment and materials. Their physical development is enhanced by equipment that provides challenge for them in the outside area. Older children show leadership and considerate behaviour towards younger children in the mixed-age setting.</p><p>MƒÅori children benefit from the value placed on te reo MƒÅori spoken in meaningful contexts, sharing karakia before meals, singing waiata together and tuakana-teina relationships that foster children‚Äôs leadership.</p><p>The programme is a good balance of planned and emergent experiences. It is based on a thematic approach and informed by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum). The Kidicorp Ltd. ‚ÄòBe School Ready‚Äô approach is integrated throughout the curriculum, contributes to children‚Äôs early literacy and mathematics skills, and builds on their dispositions for learning. Teachers recognise and document the key competencies from <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> to support individual children‚Äôs transition to school. The centre has developed close relationships and information sharing with nearby primary schools, which is contributing to positive transitions to school for children and their families. Parents receive good information from the service about schools in the local area.</p><p>An innovative approach to planning and assessment has been recently implemented. It is intended to provide clear direction and structure for teaching practice. A detailed framework for planning and a reflective approach to assessment of each child‚Äôs learning and development is shared with parents. This approach is supported through the use of individual portfolios and formal, face-to-face meetings with parents, whƒÅnau and teachers. Parents contribute their aspirations that have the potential to further inform a child-centred programme developed in partnership with teachers. Families are well informed through a variety of communication systems, including computer technology and informative wall displays.</p><p>The dedicated head teacher and teaching team provided continuity and consistency for families and children through a challenging time of change. They work as a collaborative team with the experienced and well-qualified centre manager with the clear objective of providing a quality education and care service. ERO observed some examples of good teaching practice that included:</p><ul>
<li>teachers supporting children to persevere and problem solve</li>
<li>conversations and questioning that extend children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>responsive and caring interactions.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager articulates a clear philosophy that is shared with teachers and families. He holds and shares high expectations for teacher professional practice. He is well supported by the professional services and business managers from Kidicorp Ltd. Together they have developed a strategic approach and action plans to guide centre growth and improvement. These are linked to professional development opportunities that support and foster emergent leadership and staff potential. While self-review and performance management processes at all levels provide effective quality assurance, these processes could be used more effectively to more clearly identify areas for further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leadership and ERO agree that an important step for ongoing development is to review the curriculum to further empower older children. Attention should be given to enhancing children‚Äôs opportunities to express their creativity, follow their curiosity and co-construct their learning over time. Consideration should be given to increasing access to age-appropriate resources and materials that add complexity and challenge for older children, particularly in the outdoor environment. Children‚Äôs understanding of sustainability and natural science would be enhanced if they were provided with greater access to the natural world.</p><p>The centre manager needs to develop a more strategic approach to implementing bicultural and multi-cultural responsive practices that link to children‚Äôs individual language, culture and identity. This should include further consultation with iwi about significant places and stories of local interest to enrich the curriculum and enhance success for MƒÅori tamariki and their whƒÅnau. Teachers would benefit from further professional development to build their capacity and confidence in implementing bicultural and multicultural practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five Vardon completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five Vardon will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
