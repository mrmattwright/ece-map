</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Service is an all-day education and care service located on the outskirts of Morrinsville. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 under 2 years of age. It is part of a group of 17 centres owned by Provincial Childcare.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the centre has been purchased by new owners. There has been considerable change to management and teaching staff in the last year.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by a culture of partnership, encompassing respectful, trusting relationships. Teachers aim to provide an environment that allows children to make their own choices, take risks and to solve problems. The owners value the autonomy of the centre to implement Provincial Childcare values. This enables the centre to be responsive to its community and capitalise on collaborative partnerships amongst teachers and parents.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report to revise the staff appraisal process and develop an effective annual plan.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in two separate age-based areas. They explore in spacious and motivating indoor and outdoor environments. Areas are well-designed, aesthetically pleasing and appropriately equipped to enhance the learning and care of children. Particular emphasis is placed on the natural world, with children involved in growing food to prepare and eat together. There are many opportunities for younger and older children to experience physical challenge and develop their skills. A weekly gymnastic programme enhances older children’s confidence to take risks and add complexity to their physical skills.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from high quality, nurturing and responsive care. They experiment with a wide variety of materials and equipment. Teachers prepare an imaginative and interesting range of experiences for them to investigate. They use rich language with children. Teachers give priority to spending unhurried time with children and promote children’s resilience through encouragement and affirmation of success. Familiar routines are maintained in the centre through regular sharing and conversations with whānau and parents. In a relatively short time, the new teaching team has established a culture of respect where very young children demonstrate high levels of belonging and wellbeing. Babies and toddlers are settled and confident learners.</p><p>Older children enjoy many opportunities to follow their interests and extend their learning, accessing a wide range of good quality equipment. They are developing early concepts of literacy and mathematics. A good variety of creative experiences is promoting children’s artistic expression. Children confidently share their ideas and opinions with teachers. They have many opportunities to solve problems, take leadership and make choices about their learning. The programme includes visits to the wider community. Regular celebrations include whānau and families, who share in children’s learning and success. Older children are confident and competent explorers who are well supported to take ownership of their learning.</p><p>Attractive and informative centre displays put the child at the centre of the learning. Children are able to revisit their learning with whānau and families. Digital portfolios are providing a good record of children’s participation and interests. They promote opportunities for whānau, families and other interested adults to share their ideas and aspirations with teachers. Individual portfolios are valued as an important literacy tool and are accessible for children to revisit learning and share with others.</p><p>A teacher with knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori is contributing to a growing understanding of bicultural practices. Early relationships are being established and fostered with local iwi. Children and teachers are enjoying learning and sharing waiata, poi, implementing tikanga practices such as karakia kai, and growing in confidence to use some te reo Māori in meaningful contexts. Teachers are developing their understanding of ways to write appropriate learning stories to reflect children’s cultures and Māori values. This is promoting success for Māori children and whānau.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager sets clear and high expectations in regard to teaching and learning. There is a focus on fostering a collaborative team across the centre and building teachers' understanding of high quality practice. All staff have established positive and respectful relationships with each other, children, parents and management personnel. They have successfully maintained stability for children in the centre through a time of change.</p><p>The new owners are well supported by experienced operational, educational and business managers, all of whom regularly communicate with, and visit the centre. Provincial Childcare develops policies and procedures for all centres and regularly monitors their implementation. Learning Curves reviews these regularly, within their context, with opportunities for input from parents. The centre is effectively governed. It would now be useful for the owners to consider documenting an overarching vision for all the centres in the group.</p><p>Leaders have upgraded the appraisal system and staff are improving self-review processes. Both have been identified by the centre as areas for ongoing development to ensure continuing improvement of outcomes for children. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders should give further consideration to review assessment, planning and evaluation practices. Priority should be given to strengthening the expectations for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>intentional planning and teaching to integrate early concepts of literacy and mathematics in all areas of the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the content and purpose of child-centred portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flexible routines that empower children to persist in play and build their self-care skills.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>23 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
