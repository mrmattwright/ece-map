</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frimley Early Learning Centre is located in Hastings. It is licensed for 42 children from birth to five years of age. The infants and toddlers enrolled at the centre have their own designated space. Over half the children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Since the March 2013 ERO report, there have been two changes in ownership. The centre, previously known as Frimley Playhouse, came under the management of Provincial Childcare Holdings in May 2015. Processes and systems for strengthening the key next steps identified in the previous report are in place under the current ownership structure.</p><p>Provincial Childcare provides management and administrative support. A new centre manager was appointed, and new teaching team established. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The new owners and centre management have appropriately identified a number of areas for development. These include plans to enhance the physical environment. Good progress has been made in addressing identified issues.</p><p>Prior to the change of ownership, the Ministry of Education provided support through the Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) initiative.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy promotes reciprocal, respectful relationships through tikanga MƒÅori values and principles. Children and their parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed. Teachers know the children and their families well. They spend time talking with parents to share information that supports children to be settled for the day. The philosophy underpins teaching and learning, and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children‚Äôs emotional and social competence are well supported by positive guidance from staff. Teachers foster children‚Äôs friendship and leadership opportunities through caring for others.</p><p>Routines are unhurried and flexible. Children are supported in self-directed play and this is used by teachers to extend the interests of learners. They move freely between indoor and outdoor spaces. Children are provided with opportunities to be creative and imaginative. Their mathematical and literacy thinking are extended through sustained play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured in an environment that encourages exploration and use of resources that support their overall development. They benefit from learning experiences within care routines.</p><p>There has been a deliberate, planned approach by governance and management to strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation. Newly implemented systems and processes have increased teachers‚Äô focus on individual children‚Äôs interests, and strengthened parent and whƒÅnau contribution to their child‚Äôs learning. Parent partnership for learning remains an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Profiles are an attractive record of children‚Äôs learning and participation in activities. Special moments and celebrations are acknowledged. Parents‚Äô contributions are welcomed and valued. The centre is in the early stages of introducing e-portfolios which should increase parents and whƒÅnau involvement in their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre managers and teachers actively incorporate MƒÅori concepts, knowledge and practices into the curriculum. Teachers value the knowledge and experiences the children bring with them. Children‚Äôs cultural background is recognised through their leaning profile stories. There is an ongoing commitment to further embed these practices.</p><p>Teachers are building and establishing connections with local schools to strengthen and promote smooth transitions for children.</p><p>The appraisal process supports teachers to develop and strengthen their practice. There are clear links to the Practising Teacher Criteria. Teachers reflect on their actions and set goals that focus on improving outcomes for children. Provincial Childcare is actively supporting leadership and building the capacity of staff.</p><p>There is a sound framework for self review. This is used to gather information, inform decision making and direct change. Strengthening the evaluative focus of review will allow the centre manager, and Provincial Childcare management to better determine how effectively they are improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and staff agree that the following next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and embed assessment and planning practices</li>
<li>strengthen the evaluative aspect of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frimley Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frimley Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
