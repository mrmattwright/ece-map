</table><p>Sound leadership and members’ collective commitment and support for each other, coupled with ongoing assistance from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), position the centre well to improve and sustain good practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Woodhatton Playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association’s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs one SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children’s Education) session for infants and their parents and three mixed-age sessions, two of which are supported by employed supervisors. The average age of children attending is around two. Most parents attend with their children.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy emphasises the importance of creating a home away from home for families, <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> partnership and embracing the cultures of the local community to support children's early learning.</p><p>Many families are relatively new to this service and are learning about Playcentre philosophy and expectations. A core group of long–term members takes responsibility for managing operation. Ongoing challenges are retaining children through to school age, sustaining the roll and gaining parents’ commitment to training.</p><p>Since the July 2009 ERO report the property has been improved with new paint, fencing, a toddler playground and the addition of murals in the outside playground. The playcentre was relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> this year.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is strongly reflected in the programme. Promoting the wellbeing of children and their whānau and maintaining a family-friendly environment are emphasised in practice.</p><p>Members are friendly and inclusive. At each session everyone is acknowledged and warmly welcomed. The programme caters well for a diverse range of learners. Infants, toddlers and children with special learning needs are valued members of the centre community and well supported to engage in the learning experiences provided. They are nurtured by all and most are comfortable to explore the environment. A good relationship has been developed with a local school which should support families with children moving to primary school in the future.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials for children to access. The outdoor area provides good support for physical play and creative self expression. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme in the context of play. Children’s work and participation in centre activities are celebrated through displays and photographic records. A positive tone is evident. Children are friendly, and show a strong sense of belonging at playcentre. Further work could be done to maximise social learning opportunities at shared kai time, especially for the younger children.</p><p>Members are consistently respectful and responsive in their interactions with children. They are particularly attuned to the cues and actions of non-verbal learners. Many are building their confidence to work as part of a team providing learning experiences for children.</p><p>A commitment to biculturalism is highly evident in practices embedded in the programme and organisation. A centre pepeha defines its place in the local community. A long-term member/supervisor consistently integrates te reo me ngā tikanga Māori into her work, providing a positive model to support the understanding of others.</p><p>Planning for learning is enthusiastically and well led. All members write notes and photograph children's special learning moments to share with others and record in profile books. More experienced members write learning stories which they hope will support others’ understanding. Termly and daily discussions enable everyone to share information about individuals and collaboratively plan for further sessions. As a next step, members have identified the need to note the aspirations parents have for their children's learning which could be used to enrich programme planning.</p><p>Strong, committed leadership promotes good practice and positive outcomes for children. The warm culture and emphasis on building supportive relationships, fosters parents’ confidence and willingness to become involved.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focussed on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a pro-active approach to governance. Self review is valued and strongly promoted. Good frameworks are in place to support practice at centre level. Members at this centre are making good use of these to reflect on their practice and promote better outcomes for children. The appraisal of supervisors should be strengthened to better support their ongoing development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members agree they need to continue to strengthen their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation, particularly in relation to:</p><p>1. encouraging the participation of all members in recognising and responding to children's learning2. focusing more on identifying the really significant aspects of individual children’s learning in profile books and daily evaluations3. illustrating progressions of learning in profile books4. improving children's access to their profile books.</p><p>Members need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. Support to use some association frameworks more effectively, particularly those that build quality improvement, should strengthen their approach.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Woodhatton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Woodhatton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
