<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Chelsea Kindergarten on Auckland's North Shore provides sessional early childhood education for up to 30 children each session. The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association which provides a policy framework and good professional guidance for teachers. Teachers' curriculum priorities are well reflected in the programme. Children learn about the natural world and sustainability. Teachers also provide well for children's growing social competence. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> New Zealand's early childhood curriculum, underpins the programme and teachers promote the importance of play for children's learning.</p><p>Children play together in sociable ways and friendships are evident. They are confident communicators and enjoy participating in reciprocal conversations. Teachers provide a good range of activities and resources and continue to review the learning environment and the opportunities available to children. Parents appreciate teachers' welcoming and inclusive practices. They feel comfortable in the environment and value the care and education provided for their children.</p><p>The two teachers work well together, sharing information and supporting one another. They seek ongoing learning to enable them to provide a curriculum that demonstrates their commitment to bicultural practices and reflects the unique place of M&#257;ori. Teachers now need to also consider how the curriculum could be more responsive to each child's new and ongoing interests.</p><p>Development priorities are identified through a good range of self review. Greater depth and rigor to review would add value to findings and better support the development of teaching and learning. Consulting with families and wh&#257;nau about their priorities and aspirations for children's learning would help to ensure that the curriculum more clearly reflects the kindergarten community as a whole.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the service&rsquo;s vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the centre is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Chelsea Kindergarten.</p><h3>How well placed is Chelsea Kindergarten to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Context</h4><p>Chelsea Kindergarten, on Auckland's North Shore, provides sessional early childhood education for children over two years of age. The two teachers have worked together for several years and implement a programme that reflects their individual skills and strengths. ERO's 2009 review report noted many positive features of the programme. The report recommended that teachers use self review to guide kindergarten improvement.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a trial of ERO&rsquo;s revised approaches to reviews in early childhood education services. The trial used a cluster approach for the reviews of five kindergartens within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>With added depth to the good range of self review undertaken, increased consultation with parents and wh&#257;nau, and more focus on the emergent curriculum, positive learning outcomes for children would be further promoted.</p><p>M&#257;tauranga. Teachers' curriculum priorities include support for the development of children's social competence. As a result of this emphasis, children demonstrate care for each other and are inclusive in their play. Teachers also prioritise children's learning about the natural environment and sustainable practices. This focus is highly evident and is shared between the kindergarten and children's families. M&#257;ori concepts and values are threaded through this ongoing project.</p><p>Tikanga whakaako. Teachers promote the value of children learning through play. They provide an environment where children can engage for sustained periods in self-selected, sociable play with their peers. Children are articulate communicators who enjoy meaningful conversations with teachers and with friends.</p><p>Parents comment positively about the kindergarten's welcoming environment. They feel comfortable spending time in the kindergarten and find teachers very approachable. Parents appreciate the work of teachers who support children to settle and engage well.</p><p>Teachers make ongoing changes to learning environment in response to parent feedback and their own self review. Current work on transitions into and beyond kindergarten is resulting in new tools and strategies being developed to support children and families. Daily routines are well established and familiar to children.</p><p>Assessment portfolios are enjoyed by children and families. Teachers include photographs and descriptions of children's involvement in the programme. Children's comments and thoughts are regularly included and some parent contribution is evident.</p><p>Pou whakahaere. The professional services manager (PSM) provides very good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Through her regular visits she monitors the quality of teachers' practices, facilitates support through cluster group meetings and raises awareness of Association services, documentation and expectations. Teachers could make better use of appraisal goals and PSM visit reports to inform their self review and strategic planning. Association leaders agree they should continue to help teachers to use their long-term plans to become more strategic in their approach to self review.</p><p>The Association provides good support for teachers' professional growth and learning. This is linked to the Association's strategic planning and the kindergarten's own curriculum priorities.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Pou &#256;rahi. Self review helps teachers identify and plan for the kindergarten's development priorities. Greater depth and regular evaluation of both the quality of learning outcomes for children and the impacts of teaching practice would add considerable value to review findings.</p><p>M&#257;tauranga. Regular consultation with families and wh&#257;nau about curriculum content would help to ensure that the kindergarten's curriculum is more responsive to the priorities and aspirations of the kindergarten community.</p><p>Teachers have recognised the need to develop their knowledge to implement a bicultural curriculum. They intend to increase their use of te reo M&#257;ori and continue work with relevant supporting documents to deepen their understanding of responsive bicultural practices.</p><p>Tikanga whakaako. The current programme evolves from learning priorities generally determined by teachers. The next step in the development of teaching and learning is for teachers to show how they respond to individual children's ongoing and emerging interests. Planning and assessment records need to show this response and identify next step for learning. Teachers could also consider ways to include children in the development of learning goals.</p><p>Teachers could review the length of mat times and consider ways that these group times could better maintain children's interest and engagement. They could also consider ways to maximise the use of other adults in the kindergarten during sessions to support their supervision of children.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Chelsea Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the teachers agree that teachers should use in-depth and consultative self review to inform ongoing improvement to teaching and learning.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5.
