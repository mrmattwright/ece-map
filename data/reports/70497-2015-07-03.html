</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waimate Childcare Centre is a community-based centre in Waimate, South Canterbury. It provides full-day education and care for up to 47 children from infants to school age. The local community and the centre have recently been enriched by the arrival of people from diverse cultures.</p><p>The centre is governed by a parent committee and has strong community connections. A supervisor and head teacher provide leadership within the centre. Nearly all teaching staff at the centre are qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre moved to new premises in 2010 and the committee is continuing to develop the large outdoor play area. Infants and toddlers are cared for in their own separate room and have a separate outside play space.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified a number of areas for improvement. While the centre has made progress on most of these, this report identifies the need for further continuing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families have caring and trusting relationships with the teachers. The teachers go out of their way to build close connections with families and to help all families feel that they belong. Children‚Äôs cultures and languages are supported and affirmed. Children enjoy the opportunities to be involved in local community events.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs values focus on positive relationships, respect and responsibility. This is evident in the way teachers help children build their social skills and get them to make decisions in the daily programme. Children have good friendships with each other.</p><p>Teachers listen to the children and respond to their ideas. The planned programmes build on children‚Äôs interests and enthusiasms, and teachers use these to provide meaningful learning experiences. Other features of the programme include early literacy and mathematics learning and exploration of the natural world. Children hear some te reo MƒÅori and sing waiata each day. The teachers are committed to developing this area further.</p><p>The centre has a wide range of resources for play and learning. Children enjoy the very large outside play area which offers physical challenge and caters for their different preferences.</p><p>The care and education needs of infants and toddlers are well catered for. The teachers in the infant and toddler room maintain a calm pace and atmosphere and engage in one-to-one responsive interactions with children. The environment is thoughtfully set up to give children as much independence as possible. Teachers make a point of using natural materials. They keep parents well-informed about their children‚Äôs days at the centre. Younger children are well supported when they move onto the older children‚Äôs room.</p><p>The records of children‚Äôs learning show their progress over time. The best examples show what the teachers have done to foster children‚Äôs learning. Teachers communicate frequently with parents about their children‚Äôs learning and often include information from parents in stories. A next step is to clarify the systems for planning so that children‚Äôs individual learning priorities are clear for all teachers. They should also be more systematic about gathering parents‚Äô wishes for their children‚Äôs learning and using these in planning.</p><h3>Governance and Leadership</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to the centre philosophy, and have built a culture where children are valued and affirmed. Leaders have developed useful relationships with other educational leaders which support them in their roles. They have a long-standing commitment to professional development, which would be even more useful if linked to identified goals.</p><p>There is a new appraisal system in place for teachers. It still needs to be fully implemented. The leaders provide effective support for beginning teachers.</p><p>Committee members have a useful range of skills and strengths. A next step for the committee is to develop a strategic plan that identifies the priorities and direction for the centre‚Äôs future development. More effective self review is likely to help them to know how well the centre promotes positive outcomes for children and should lead to further improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A next step for the committee is to develop and implement a strategic plan that identifies the centre‚Äôs priorities for future development and the associated goals. The committee should then monitor progress of the plan and evaluate its effectiveness. Other systems such as self review, budgeting, appraisal, and professional development can be aligned towards the achievement of the identified priorities.</p><p>Committee, leaders and teachers should build a shared understanding of effective self review, and develop a schedule to review all aspects of the centre‚Äôs operation over time, including the factors that most impact on children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should also:</p><ul>
<li>plan how to strengthen MƒÅori perspectives in the programme</li>
<li>clarify the system for planning so individual learning priorities are clear for all teachers</li>
<li>be systematic about gathering parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning and using this information</li>
<li>continue to implement the new appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waimate Childcare Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waimate Childcare Centre Inc. will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>3 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
