</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiddz Homebased Early Childhood Education Service has two networks in Christchurch operating under the Kiddz Homebased umbrella. These networks are small and operate as one group. This report refers to one of the networks.</p><p>Kiddz Homebased Early Childhood Education Service is a long established, privately owned education and care service located in Christchurch.</p><p>The two members of the management team are also the visiting teachers. They have worked closely together for the past 15 years to manage the service and support educators to provide quality education and care for children.</p><p>The service was significantly affected by the 2011 – 2012 Canterbury earthquakes which resulted in a decline in numbers of children. Since that time, the management team has been focused on rebuilding the roll and marketing the service more widely throughout the region.</p><p>Kiddz Homebased Early Childhood Education Service is currently involved in three Ministry of Education projects to support participation of some learners less well served in early childhood education. These include oversight of a Pasifika playgroup and a transition to school initiative. As a result, the service is in a good position to support Pacific families.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises the importance of positive relationships for fostering children’s learning and wellbeing. Opportunities for inquiry and real-life experiences are seen as essential elements of programmes within the home-based setting and excursions into the community. Outcomes for children are at the heart of all decision making.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy is strongly evident in practice. The management team encourages regular reflection on the way agreed values are demonstrated. This supports consistent and sustained understandings and ways of working with children. The teaching team and educators work together to promote:</p><ul>
<li>a respectful and inclusive culture that includes all children and their families</li>
<li>sensitive and culturally-responsive practices</li>
<li>understandings and appreciation of the natural environment and local community</li>
<li>celebration of individuals for who they are and what they bring as a learner.</li>
</ul><p>Children are seen as competent learners and able to lead decision making about their work and play. Educators are well supported to meet the needs of infants and toddlers through one- to-one interactions and a well-paced programme that allows time for exploration and discovery.  </p><p>All children experience a curriculum that incorporates aspects of te ao Māori. There is a strong focus on integrating bicultural perspectives at all levels of the organisation. Māori culture, language and identity are valued and customs and rituals that reflect Māori traditions and practices are incorporated into learning experiences. </p><p>The service is well placed to provide appropriate support for Pacific families. The visiting teachers are involved in professional learning to support Pacific leadership in the education sector. This is providing a meaningful context for strengthening teaching and learning.</p><p>Children with complex learning needs are warmly welcomed and well supported. The management team has established purposeful relationships with a range of professional organisations and agencies. Visiting teachers work collaboratively with families to support positive outcomes for these children. </p><p>The managers have high expectations for educators’ practice. Visiting teachers see educators’ knowledge and training as key to sustaining and strengthening the quality of outcomes for children. Appropriate professional development and mentoring is provided. There are regular opportunities for collaborative reflection, discussions and sharing of new knowledge. Online feedback provides timely support for ongoing development of educators’ practice.  </p><p>The in-home curriculum is strongly child-centred and focused n learning. Children’s voices and views are encouraged and valued as a basis for planning. Literacy and mathematics are integrated in meaningful ways into play-based learning experiences. The visiting teachers and educators are story tellers who weave children’s experiences and words into memorable stories for children to revisit and enjoy. Up-to-date research and reference to best practice informs curriculum decisions.</p><p>Educators are well supported to document how they notice, recognise and respond to children’s interests and capabilities. They use learning language and make links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Carefully presented stories and photos inform parents of children’s interests, learning and involvement in a wide range of interesting experiences that encourage them to question and investigate.</p><p>Parents’ and whānau aspirations for their children are sought and valued in planning for learning. An online programme is supporting the timely sharing of children’s learning stories with parents. Visiting teachers continue to seek ways of increasing parent input into their child's learning.</p><p>Service leaders provide well planned and regular playgroups where children are supported to explore the local, natural environment with peers. Playgroups also provide opportunities for social interactions with other educators and children. The visiting teachers use this time well to model practices and mentor educators. These sessions are an important part of the services curriculum.</p><p>Recruitment, induction and development of educators’ practice are carefully considered. High quality professional learning opportunities are sought and well used. Inquiry and reflective practices lead to ongoing improvement to teaching and learning. The appraisal process for staff requires strengthening. Observations of practice, regular feedback on progress and the gathering of evidence to support attestation against the professional teaching requirements should strengthen teaching practices.</p><p>The service provider and visiting teachers are improvement focused and regularly inquire into aspects of practice. A set of quality practice indicators has been developed in partnership with the Kiddz community. A recent innovation is the introduction of 'learning hubs' where educators, parents and visiting teachers meet to discuss topics of interest and consider how improvements to practice could be made.</p><p>Taking a leadership role is actively encouraged and promoted at all levels of the service. ERO and the management team agree that strengthening the understanding and use of evaluative inquiry will help leaders to identify how well the practices, outlined in their good practice indicators, are met. This should better support decision making about the development of strategic priorities. The service provider has engaged external support for the re-development of strategic goals and to strengthen appraisal and self-review processes.</p><p>The management team has developed a range of good quality documentation to support educators. Appropriate attention is paid to ensuring that health and safety and legislative requirements for home-based education and care are consistently met. Quality assurance practices are well developed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the self review process and reviews linked to strategic priorities</li>
<li>further develop key documentation for guiding practice</li>
<li>develop a more robust visiting teacher performance management process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiddz Homebased Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiddz Homebased Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region</p><p>9 December 2014 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
