</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lower Waitaki Playcentre is a rural playcentre licensed for 25 children. It provides four morning sessions each week for children up to school age. Many families are farming and this work leads to some changes in attendance and participation at certain times of the year. Many of the children attend with a nanny or au pair. The sessions are led by a supervision team with playcentre qualifications. A parent council has oversight for the day-to-day management and operation of the service.</p><p>Lower Waitaki playcentre is one of 25 within the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). The Association consists of a core group of dedicated paid and elected members. To support members it provides a framework for management and operations, parent education programmes and personnel.</p><p>The OPA is experiencing a time of change as all playcentre associations throughout New Zealand merge with the New Zealand Playcentre Association (NZPF) to reduce duplication and make cost savings. The restructure is resulting in significant changes at an association level.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified planning, assessment and evaluation, and internal evaluation as next steps for improvement. Some progress has been made, however, with changes to the parent group and supervision team these remain next steps to develop.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Otago Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The supervision team and parents actively encourage children to develop a strong sense of belonging. This contributes to positive outcomes for children. The playcentre plays an important role in helping children and families develop friendships and find support within the local community. Children benefit from the positive relationships with the local school and there are regular mutual visits to support children's transitions.</p><p>The supervision team and parents provide a well-designed programme that reflects aspects of children's home lives. They make good use of the local community to support children's learning. Children have choices, follow their interests and have many opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing communication and social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active exploration and physical development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning self-help skills and independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning about the creative arts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children experience aspects of a bicultural curriculum, including hearing and using some te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia. The supervision team and centre advisor have identified this as an area for ongoing development, and ERO agrees this work needs to continue.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported in the programme by their parents and other adults. They play and learn alongside their older friends and there are suitable resources and experiences available to them.</p><p>The playcentre parents have identified that the centre philosophy has not been reviewed for some time. It is now timely to redevelop the playcentre philosophy to reflect the current parents' shared values and beliefs, commitment to te tiriti o Waitangi and desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Systems for planning, assessment and evaluation for individuals and groups of children need to be strengthened. When planning for groups and individual children, adults must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more actively involve all parents in using the assessment and planning information for individual children to guide interactions and experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how they value and respond to children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more closely align the strategies and experiences to support the identified learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that learning stories consistently reflect progress in children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how the strategies and experiences have supported learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The supervision team and parents do not have a good understanding of robust internal evaluation practices. The OPA and centre advisor need to support the supervision team and parents to develop effective internal evaluation practices. The schedule of review of playcentre operations needs strengthening. Adults in the playcentre should ensure their practice is guided by the most recent OPA policies and procedures.</p><p>There are high levels of parent involvement in the day-to-day programme and life of the playcentre. The parent council is responsive to community needs, focuses on roll growth and ongoing sustainability.</p><p>The playcentre benefits from ongoing support from the OPA. Centre advisors use effective internal evaluation to monitor how well centres are promoting positive outcomes for children. They identify the strengths and areas for support for each playcentre and report to the OPA. The OPA ensures that decisions made further support the playcentre. Regular appraisals are carried out, however the appraisal process needs to be further developed to be effective. The OPA is achieving its strategic goal to increase the numbers of parents who participate in playcentre training to ensure ongoing sustainability. The OPA regularly monitors progress towards the strategic goals and evaluates the effectiveness of strategies.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The playcentre supervisors and parents with the support of the OPA need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the playcentre philosophy and include their desired outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop planning and assessment processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop their understanding and use of effective internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The key next step for the OPA is to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the appraisal system continues to be developed and embedded.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lower Waitaki Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the OPA should ensure playcentre members use the most recent OPA policies and procedures to guide their practice.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lower Waitaki Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>17 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
