</table><p>Grant Braes Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Grants Braes Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged over two years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 43 children. Children participate in half or whole day learning programmes running from 8.30am to 2.30pm. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by four qualified early childhood teachers and one teacher aide.</p><p>The kindergarten's kaupapa states that children will:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>experience a warm, caring, fun and safe learning environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop reciprocal learning relationships with their peers, teachers and wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foster ongoing and diverse learning within a bicultural curriculum framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has sustained the effective practices noted in ERO's 2015 review and continues to make good progress with curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation practices, teacher appraisal and internal evaluation systems. Significant changes to the outdoor environment have contributed positively to teaching and learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Grants Braes Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens administered by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). A general manager oversees the association under the governance of a board. Senior teachers provide ongoing professional advice and guidance to each kindergarten on teaching and learning. This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play in a calm, unhurried environment where teachers give them time to make decisions and learn from watching their peers. They experience warm, responsive and respectful interactions with each other and their teachers. Children feel a sense of belonging and place in the programme and are confident, competent and capable learners.</p><p>There are caring and respectful relationships at all levels of the kindergarten. Teachers have established reciprocal relationships with children, parents, families and whƒÅnau. As new families arrive into the kindergarten, teachers are deliberate in their approach to get to know them well.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments are very well planned and resourced. There is a strong focus on kaitiakitanga - care for self, the environment (sustainability) and others. There is a good balance of quiet and busy spaces for children to use in their play. The natural outdoor spaces are large and interesting and provide opportunities for children to take risks, challenge themselves and explore.</p><p>The curriculum is broad based and resourced appropriately to support the needs, interests and ages of all children. There are positive levels of engagement by children in a range of curriculum areas. Children play cooperatively and collaboratively alongside their peers.</p><p>Core MƒÅori values and practices are evident in the programme. The programme supports and promotes aspects of te ao MƒÅori such as whanaungatanga, maanakitanga, kaitiakitanga and tuakana¬†teina.</p><p>Diverse learners are well supported and planned for. Teachers work closely with migrant and new families to support their transition into the kindergarten. Transitions into, within and beyond the kindergarten are well managed by teachers.</p><p>The teaching team is collaborative, reflective and improvement focused. The head teacher models a culture of shared leadership. Teachers use the strengths and expertise of each other to support their professional practices. There is a strong commitment from teachers to ongoing professional learning.</p><p>Teachers participate in reflective practice that contributes to effective internal evaluation. Findings from internal evaluation are used to bring about continued improvement in the programme and practices. The senior teacher continues to provide a high level of professional support to the teachers.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015 reviews. The DK‚Äôs mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. The DK has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. The DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps for the DK</h3><p>The board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels is evaluative to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the DK‚Äôs and kindergartens‚Äô priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps for Grants Braes Kindergarten</h3><p>The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices to clearly reflect the learning priorities for children and the role of the teacher to support these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen learning-focused partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grant Braes Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework.
