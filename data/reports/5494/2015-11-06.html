</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below. </p><h3>Background</h3><p>Grants Braes Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It is located in Waverley close to local schools and provides learning for up to 40 children in the morning and 30 in the afternoon. Children may attend for the full day if their family chooses.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by families from the local and surrounding areas. Many of the families come from diverse cultural backgrounds. A dedicated parent committee raises funds to improve the kindergarten’s resources. Parents help to maintain the buildings and grounds.</p><p>Teachers at Grants Braes Kindergarten aim for children to be confident, competent learners and to provide a warm, safe, fun and empowering environment for children and their families.</p><p>The qualified teaching team is experienced and the head teacher has provided stable leadership in the kindergarten for 10 years. Since the June 2012 review, the teachers have improved their knowledge and use of self review and are planning more purposefully for individual children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 kindergarten reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing at Grants Braes Kindergarten. They appear settled and purposeful as they play by themselves, with and alongside others. Children benefit from close nurturing relationships with their teachers. Teachers challenge and extend children’s thinking and ideas. They have genuine conversations with children. They give positive guidance to children as they learn to manage themselves and relate to others with empathy. </p><p>Teachers get to know the children and their families very well. They provide meaningful learning in the kindergarten based on their knowledge of the children’s home backgrounds. Teachers value children’s cultures, language and identity. This is evident in the way they acknowledge and celebrate special events such as Chinese New Year and Mātariki. Children with particular learning needs are effectively supported by teachers sharing and using specific strategies.</p><p>Children enjoy a broad range of well-planned learning experiences within and beyond the kindergarten. They have many opportunities for creative and dramatic play, ICT learning, early literacy and mathematics, exploration and making choices about what they want to do.</p><p>Children's learning is supported by effective group planning. This includes specific strategies to:</p><ul>
<li>focus teachers on meeting all children’s needs</li>
<li>settle new children</li>
<li>develop children’s social skills</li>
<li>increase children’s awareness of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</li>
</ul><p>Children are well supported as they enter kindergarten and move through to school. Parents receive information to help them choose and enrol their children at school. Teachers could explore more ways of sharing their knowledge of the children’s learning with the schools the children will be attending.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, teachers have a better process so they all know what children’s next learning steps are. They are increasingly using social media as a means to share children’s learning with parents and extended family. They have found families are quick to give feedback and share their wishes for their children through this means. Online and paper records of learning are enjoyed by children and their families. The next step is for teachers to be more consistent in recording what they will do to support children’s next learning steps.</p><p>There is a useful framework to guide self review. Teachers often use the findings from self review to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The teachers work well as a team. They know and use each other’s strengths to support children’s learning and wellbeing. They focus on improvement and proactively access and attend relevant professional learning. They have developed priorities for Grants Braes Kindergarten. However, these have not been linked to the kindergarten’s philosophy or DK’s strategic direction.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers. </p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Some aspects of the kindergarten practices could be further developed and improved. Teachers, with the support of the senior teacher, need to more consistently state in records of children's learning what they plan to do to extend and support the identified next learning steps.</p><p>Self-review practice could be strengthened by having a very clear focus to investigate and ensuring the indicators of good practice relate to the focus. Teachers should then identify how well their practices match those outlined in the indicators.</p><p>When the teachers next review the philosophy they should make clear what is valued as important learning for children. They should also ensure the philosophy expresses their commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers have some ideas about what they want for the future of the kindergarten. Their ideas could be developed into a strategic plan that shows the priorities and actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Related systems such as professional learning, appraisal, self-review topics and senior teacher support could then be aligned to strengthen the strategic focus.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the DK’s vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher, it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grants Braes Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Grants Braes Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>6 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
