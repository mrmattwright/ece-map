</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Heretaunga Park Early Learning Centre is a privately owned all day service catering for a maximum of 50 children. Staffing changes and a new management structure in 2014 have resulted in a new phase of team building. The owner is the director and contact person of the centre.</p><p>A centre manager oversees day-to-day operations. Two team leaders, one for children aged up to two years and one for children over two years, lead the teaching teams.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses commitment to recognising children as individuals, providing a rich programme, promoting reciprocal relationships, and acknowledging the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi. The vision is to ‚Äònurture the leaders of tomorrow‚Äô.</p><p>Healthy food is provided by the centre. Inclusive practices are followed so that children's dietary needs are met.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has a clear vision, philosophy and strategic direction to support and sustain positive outcomes for children. A well developed strategic plan describes development for 2014-2016 and shows a clear focus on children‚Äôs learning. Sound, clear governance systems are in place to support day to day operation. The Director actively supports leadership development.</p><p>Appropriate, prioritised professional development is available for all staff. Current professional development is focused on assessment and planning for learning.</p><p>Attractive, individual assessment portfolios record children's participation, progress and aspects of their learning. These are accessible for children to revisit. The development of agreed standards for learning stories assists consistency of teacher practice. Some next learning steps and connections to prior learning are evident and child voice is captured. Parents increasingly contribute to the portfolios. Improved quality of learning stories should enable closer links with planning.</p><p>Planning processes still need strengthening and refining. While individual plans (IDPs) are developed monthly, based on child observation, and goals set with families, planning for groups of children does not clearly connect to these. Teaching strategies could be more explicitly stated.</p><p>The curriculum is a mix of teacher-directed and child-led activities. It is timely, as part of curriculum review, to reconsider the balance of these, to provide more opportunities for sustained, child-led play. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into many areas of play. Children have experiences relating to the many cultures in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p>A strongly reflective culture is evident across the centre. A sound framework for self review is well established and involves all staff. It is used to support improvements to teaching and learning. The newly adopted appraisal system is a useful, interactive process involving reflection, goal setting, and coaching and mentoring. ERO encourages this direction.</p><p>Children experience affirming and caring interactions with teachers. They are familiar with centre routines and expectations. Self management is promoted and encouraged. Most children show a positive sense of wellbeing and belonging. Some show sustained engagement in their play.</p><p>Some adults are skilled at engaging children in conversation and extending their language, thinking, and problem-solving. Their interactions include intentional teaching and learning strategies. The revised appraisal model, the established culture of self review, and continued work with the professional development facilitator, all provide a good platform from which to lift the quality of teaching practice.</p><p>There is a centre focus on building relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers continue to explore ways to further involve parents in learning partnerships.</p><p>The quality of how teachers transition children through the centre has been reviewed and a sound, flexible system developed to meet individual needs. Strong links are established with local schools and there are plans to further extend reciprocal visits to support children‚Äôs transition to school.</p><p>Leaders express commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi obligations. Links with a local marae are being established. ERO affirms the decision to develop teacher‚Äôs confidence and knowledge of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori to better respond to MƒÅori learners and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Continuing with a facilitator to improve planning processes should increase the clarity of how teachers develop children's learning goals.</p><p>Teachers should continue to share and develop teaching strategies to extend children‚Äôs thinking and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Heretaunga Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Heretaunga Park Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>19 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
