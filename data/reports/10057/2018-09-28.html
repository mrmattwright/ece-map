</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Kingdom in the Far North is a well-established early learning service next to Awanui Primary School. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including eight up to two years of age. The majority of children have siblings and whƒÅnau who have previously attended the centre.</p><p>The centre is one of two privately owned services in the local area. The owners have a range of skills that support the service's strategic direction. One owner provides daily management support. A supervisor oversees curriculum management and mentors teachers at the centre. The teaching team includes five registered teachers who are supported by two student teachers and a cook, who also relieves teachers on their break.</p><p>The service is founded on a philosophy that promotes cultural respect and positive partnerships with whƒÅnau. It is committed to supporting children to become confident learners. <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guides the daily programme and teachers' practice.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report highlights many positive practices that promote children's learning. The key next step in relation to teacher appraisal has been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and competent exploring the programme. They have a strong sense of belonging. Teachers greet children and their whƒÅnau when they arrive to discuss children's wellbeing and stories from home. As a result, children settle quickly into the centre.</p><p>Children enjoy imaginative play and explore happily alongside each other. They choose their play, based on their own preferences and interests. Teachers encourage children to engage in activities. They also use children‚Äôs first language in the context of their play. Children are engaged and can sustain their play for long periods with their peers, adults or by themselves.</p><p>Children with special needs have individual programmes, and teachers maximise their participation and learning. Children‚Äôs portfolios record their participation in the programme and their learning and development over time. Parents contribute to learning plans for their children. Literacy, mathematics, science, and technology concepts are woven through the programme. Teachers' strategies for supporting children to extend their learning could be more explicitly planned and documented.</p><p>Teachers are caring and attentive towards children. They provide culturally responsive care that fosters a strong sense of belonging in the children. Infants and toddlers benefit from good periods of uninterrupted play, and they make independent choices from accessible resources. Increasing children‚Äôs access to a greater variety of open-ended resources would more effectively support and sustain children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Teachers value children‚Äôs home languages and cultural and life experiences. Children‚Äôs work is valued and displayed attractively on the walls. Effective transition processes support children as they move through the centre and on to school.</p><p>Routines provide a useful, but flexible framework for the day. Tikanga MƒÅori is evident at 'WhƒÅriki Time' and includes karakia, waiata, storytelling about te ao MƒÅori, and children's mihimihi. Children enthusiastically respond to teachers‚Äô use of te reo MƒÅori and are familiar with waiata and karakia.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environment is attractive, and the well-defined areas of play support children‚Äôs engagement in the programme. The cultures of children and teachers are acknowledged through the display of whakapapa in play areas. WhƒÅnau enjoy cultural events and festivals that are celebrated in the centre.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô respectful relationships with children and their whƒÅnau are a strength. WhƒÅnau who spoke to ERO appreciate the support centre leaders and staff give them and their children. Teachers are further developing ways to build on whƒÅnau engagement and contribution in the centre‚Äôs programme. Leadership is a collaborative process. Teachers could consider encouraging and supporting children to take leadership roles and responsibilities in the centre programme.</p><p>Positive support from skilful and experienced managers has been valuable. They promote a collaborative and transparent approach to the good governance and management of the centre for children, their whƒÅnau and teachers. Professional learning and development has supported the teaching team in having a shared understanding of their goals and plans for the future of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree key next steps for improving professional practice should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness of curriculum design and teachers' professional development in enhancing learning outcomes for all children particularly in relation to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting regular reflection and the evaluation of progress towards strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Kingdom completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service needs to report to parents and the community how the service is using its equity funding.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Kingdom will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
