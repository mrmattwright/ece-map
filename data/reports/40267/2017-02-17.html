</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Earlybirds Educare - Sala Street is one of three centres in the same complex, it is located in Rotorua and provides a full day education and care service for children from 2 1/2 to 4 years of age. The centre is licensed for 50 children. The current role is 47 children of which 10 children identify as Māori. Approximately a quarter of the roll includes children from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, Evolve Education Group has taken ownership of the service and provide governance and management support for the centre. Since the change of ownership, a new complex manager and head teacher have been appointed. The teaching team consists of four qualified teachers and one teacher in training.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made positive progress in the areas of self review and the emergent curriculum identified in the 2013 ERO report. This centre has a positive reporting history.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is inspired by Reggio Emilia, underpinned by strong respectful relationships between both children and adults, and the active involvement of parents in their children's learning. Children are encouraged to be independent, capable and confident learners who are working towards achieving the centre's goals so they are ready for their next learning journey.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have developed a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing, and demonstrate high levels of confidence and engagement in the life of the centre. They have developed strong and trusting relationships with teachers and one another. Provision has been made for children to settle into the centre through the process of positive encouragement from teachers and children. This supports the development of reciprocal and affirming relationships with peers. Children are active explorers, encouraged to be independent, and investigate the many opportunities within the richly resourced environments. ERO observed many examples of children engaged in sustained play, making independent choices and decisions about their learning.</p><p>The curriculum is clearly defined and influenced by the engagement of the parent community and home-centre partnerships, Reggio Emilia inspired programmes, and responsive approaches to learning. These approaches strongly align to the philosophy, the centre's goals, and projects that develop from teachers and informed by children's interests.</p><p>Children's learning is effectively identified and documented in learning journals. Teachers have introduced an online portfolio system, and through this are encouraging parents and whānau to contribute to their child's learning. Group projects are well documented in learning journals and learning is aligned to the centre's goals.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's learning and care needs, and use a wide range of effective teaching strategies to support and encourage them to settle and explore the centre. There is a strong focus on the integration of te reo Māori, oral literacy, and self care and management through responsive care routines, which meets the centre's goal of promoting independence.</p><p>Leaders and teachers place high priority on supporting and responding to children with additional needs. They work hard to develop reciprocal relationships with their whānau and have implemented effective and inclusive transition practices throughout the complex.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have developed effective and useful processes for self review that has led to positive changes to the environment, literacy, mathematics, te ao Māori and appraisal. Professional learning and development has resulted in a more collaborative approach to self review and decision making.</p><p>Leadership is effectively focused on building the quality of teaching and the viability of the centre. Centre leaders are committed to developing knowledge and skills to further develop the environment, and enhance teaching practice in order to ensure quality outcomes for children.</p><p>Effective governance and management approaches have led to improvements to organisational and educational outcomes for teachers and children. There are now stronger lines of accountability, and greater provision for additional resourcing. This has resulted in improved sustainability, financial viability and significant roll growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further strengthen and promote positive outcomes for children the centre needs to review and refine aspects of the curriculum and assessment practice. As part of this review, centre leaders should consider the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a shared vison and expectations for the delivery of the curriculum and goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personalised individual assessment for learning, and responsive planning for children's next learning steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional development in the effective use of the online portfolio system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aligning of the appraisal system with teachers' specific goals to promote effective practices in the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects of development is likely to increase the continuity of learning for children. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Earlybirds Educare - Sala Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Earlybirds Educare - Sala Street will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>17 February 2017 </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
