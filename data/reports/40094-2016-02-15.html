</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Nga Tamariki O Te Waiariki Educare is a privately owned early childhood service that caters for children from the ages of six months to five years. It is located on the grounds of Waiariki Institute of Technology in Rotorua. The centre provides education and care for the children of students of the institute and families from the wider community. There were 34 children at the centre at the time of the ERO review of whom 19 are MƒÅori. Significant numbers of Indian and Philipino children make up an ethnically diverse roll. The centre is open from 7.30am to 5.30pm each weekday. It provides education in a mixed age-group setting in which the various age groups play and interact together throughout the day.</p>
<p>Management of the centre is undertaken by two of the centre owners. Curriculum leadership is provided by a knowledgeable programme coordinator. A team leader provides organisational leadership. Of the 9 staff, 8 are qualified early childhood teachers. A comprehensive centre philosophy reflects appropriate early childhood best practice whereby teachers use children‚Äôs emerging interests to facilitate learning through play.</p>
<p>The centre has responded well to the areas for review and development identified in the 2012 ERO review.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are settled and engaged and initiate their own play in a spacious and diverse learning environment. They play well with and alongside others and frequently talk about what they are doing and willingly share their ideas. Children are welcomed, respected and valued, and confidently explore their world. There are many opportunities for them to have fun and sustain play. Interaction with babies and young toddlers are especially caring and nurturing. Teachers make effective use of care routines such as nappy changes and sleep times, to support oral language development. The mixed age-group setting promotes tuakana/teina relationships where younger children learn from older ones.</p>
<p>ERO observed examples of effective teaching practice including:</p>
<ul><li>support for oral language development through meaningful conversations, support for imaginative play, incidental singing and re-enacting stories</li>
<li>the use of open questions to extend children‚Äôs thinking</li>
<li>empowering children as learners by using their ideas to complete minor projects within the centre</li>
<li>meaningful integration of literacy and numeracy concepts in play.</li>
</ul><p>New planning and assessment processes, ongoing internal professional development and external mentoring have deepened teachers understanding of children‚Äôs learning. An emphasis on skills, knowledge and dispositions, such as curiosity and resilience, has enhanced the abilities of teachers to identify opportunities and possibilities to extend children‚Äôs learning. Teachers are now more deliberate and intentional in their interactions with children. Many opportunities for professional development have led to improved outcomes for children especially in the areas of positive guidance and education for sustainability.</p>
<p>Teachers make good use of their diverse languages and cultural backgrounds to promote a greater sense of belonging for children who can see their own languages, identities and cultures reflected in the programme and environment. For example, grace for meals and songs in the children‚Äôs home languages are a feature. Some teachers use te reo MƒÅori incidentally throughout the day. Tikanga MƒÅori such as karakia and waiata are a normal part of daily practice.</p>
<p>Teachers and leaders have made considerable progress in strengthening partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. Owners are committed to ensuring early childhood education is accessible to all and to responding to parent needs. Families spoken to by ERO appreciate a welcoming atmosphere. A well-structured and sensitive process ensures both parents and children feel safe and secure when transitioning into the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers have successfully increased parent participation in planning and assessment processes and their appreciation and understanding of the learning that occurs through play. There are many opportunities for them to be involved in social activities organised by staff and in the daily life of the centre. They are kept well-informed about their children‚Äôs learning and interests through informal discussions and attractive individual assessment portfolios. There are also bi-annual parent teacher meetings.</p>
<p>Positive features of owners‚Äô leadership of the centre include:</p>
<ul><li>provision of a wide range of professional development and mentoring opportunities for staff</li>
<li>ongoing, well-documented self-review, which leads to improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>a comprehensive policy framework, which guides teacher and management practice</li>
<li>a high level of responsiveness to families needs‚Äô which increases accessibility to ongoing early childhood education.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The key next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>continue to increase the quality of interactions between teachers and children to further extend children‚Äôs thinking and learning. A key element of this will be to review the factors that have the potential to reduce the quality of interactions with children during busy transition times such as eating, sleeping, toileting and mat-times</li>
<li>develop a regular cycle of curriculum review to ensure that all areas of play are well-resourced and teachers are up-to-date on how to use each area to facilitate children's learning and play</li>
<li>increase the emphasis on Te Ao MƒÅori throughout the programme, including MƒÅori values and concepts, local tribal history and te reo MƒÅori, which moves beyond simple commands and words of praise.</li>
<li>introduce a collaborative strategic planning process, which covers all areas of centre operations and aligns self-review, professional development and teacher appraisal</li>
<li>strengthen the professional culture within the centre to ensure high quality communication, leadership, management and team-work</li>
<li>review and strengthen support for children transitioning from the centre to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education provides the centre with a programme of support in order to ensure the areas for review and development identified in this report are effectively addressed.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nga Tamariki O Te Waiariki Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Nga Tamariki O Te Waiariki Educare will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
