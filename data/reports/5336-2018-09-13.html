</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sun Valley Kindergarten is located in Wainuiomata. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 40 children, aged over two years. At the time of this ERO evaluation, 19 of the 60 children enrolled identify as MƒÅori and eight as of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on ‚ÄòHe waka eke noa‚Äô we‚Äôre all in this together, underpinned by the key values of whakawhanaungatanga, tikanga rua, motuhake and whƒÅngai for supporting children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO evaluation, a new head teacher as well as a new teaching team have been appointed. All teachers are qualified. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Enviroschools programme. This promotes environmental sustainability.</p><p>Sun Valley Kindergarten is one of 19 services in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the June 2015 ERO report, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for the kindergarten. These included: promoting MƒÅori and Pacific success; assessment and planning for learning; and strengthening evaluation practices. Good progress has been made in addressing these areas.</p><p>The association also had some areas for development including: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific families; evaluation and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a purposeful play-based programme. Learning spaces encourage them to explore, interact, experiment and have fun. The outdoor space effectively reflects the kindergarten‚Äôs focus on environmental sustainability. Planting, nurturing and harvesting fruit and vegetables enriches the natural environment. Working independently or in groups is fostered throughout the kindergarten. Teachers work alongside children supporting and affirming their play and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten appropriately supports children with additional learning needs. Teachers work in partnership with the families, whƒÅnau and outside agencies, when appropriate, to plan and monitor their progress.</p><p>Kaupapa MƒÅori practices are well established in the kindergarten. Community expertise is used effectively to enrich the programme through weekly waiata MƒÅori sessions. These are popular activities. Children's culture, language and identity are highly valued and celebrated. A key next step is encouraging a greater use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday practice in the kindergarten. In addition leaders should consider ways they can weave a place-based curriculum that promotes and celebrates te ao MƒÅori places unique to Wainuiomata.</p><p>A new system for planning children‚Äôs learning is currently being developed. Parents, whƒÅnau and teachers co-construct learning goals for their child‚Äôs individual needs. Leaders and teachers should consider how they can further enhance this framework by including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>specific learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identification of teaching strategies that support learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of assessment documentation to clearly show progression towards children's learning goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children sense of belonging is well supported by teachers as they transition into the kindergarten and moving on to school.</p><p>Clear internal evaluation expectations are provided for staff. Senior teachers work collaboratively with the teaching team to build their evaluative understanding. Teachers are beginning to build their knowledge and understanding of how they can evaluate the impact of their practices on children‚Äôs learning. A continued focus on outcomes for children is important.</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goalsetting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen this system by developing an inquiry-based approach to teacher appraisal. ERO's external evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>The governance board includes a wide range of community representation and useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting its goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. The board and senior leadership actively seek equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that the association's next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor, evaluate and report on the extent to which children and their families‚Äô outcomes are improved though systems, processes and initiatives. This should include consideration of impact on specific priority groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to increase opportunities for whƒÅnau to actively contribute to the association‚Äôs operation and strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association's senior teaching team is reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact children‚Äôs learning. Leaders successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhance the planning for learning framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a place-based curriculum, as well as encouraging greater use of te reo MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build internal evaluation knowledge and understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association agrees they should increase the focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>measuring outcomes for children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing whƒÅnau and community partnership practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sun Valley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sun Valley Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>13 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
