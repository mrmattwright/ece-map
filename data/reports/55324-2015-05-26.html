</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manaaki Tamariki Childcare and Education Centre is an all day early childhood service catering for children from infants to school age. It is situated in the grounds of the Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT) in central Gisborne. Priority is given to allocating placements to the children of EIT&rsquo;s staff and students. The centre is managed by a committee of parents and staff, and includes representation from EIT. Responsibility for day-to-day management and organisation is delegated to the centre manager.</p><p>Committee members provide effective governance and administration of the centre. This includes ensuring that the supervisor and staff receive generous professional development opportunities. The manager provides strong and knowledgeable professional leadership that supports the supervisor in her management role, and has assisted in establishing a collaborative staff culture. The supervisor and teaching team are enthusiastic about providing high quality care and education for all children at the centre.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 40 children, including 10 up to the age of two. The centre celebrates the cultures of M&#257;ori, New Zealand European/P&#257;keh&#257; and Tongan.</p><p>Most teachers are fully qualified and registered. They represent the three cultures and proficiency in their languages is evident. Many have been at the centre for a long time and provide a sense of stability and security. They know the families and children well. The spacious physical environment is stimulating and challenging for children.</p><p>The July 2012 ERO report noted the positive developments since the review a year previously. This report confirms that changes made have been embedded and further positive improvements have since been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recently reviewed centre philosophy, summed up by the whakatauki: &ldquo;A tatou taonga mo apopo &ndash; children are our treasures of tomorrow" is very evident in practice.</p><p>Wh&#257;nau, parents and children are warmly welcomed into this stimulating, caring environment. Their contributions are sought and respected. There is meaningful dialogue about each child&rsquo;s achievements for the day.</p><p>Warm, purposeful, affirming interactions support children&rsquo;s social development. Teachers work alongside children engaging in their play, sustaining conversations and extending their learning. Positive guidance is evident and cooperation is well modelled to children, who work and play happily with each other for sustained periods of time. Children are supported and challenged.</p><p>Teachers embrace and acknowledge individual children&rsquo;s cultural heritage. Their creativity and expressions are enhanced through art and craft, songs and music, and stories and drama from their own and other cultures. Tongan children&rsquo;s culture is celebrated and modelled by a teacher who is fluent in the language and has good links with the local Tongan community.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. Teachers provide a variety of opportunities for reading, writing, construction, exploration, dramatic play and the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. They encourage children&rsquo;s investigations and thinking. Children engage in spontaneous free-play experiences according to their interests and preferences.</p><p>As a result of appropriate professional development teachers have further developed skills and knowledge to meet the needs of infants and toddlers. A newly established room has specifically designated teachers who model the room&rsquo;s name, Morimori, to nurse and nurture. Children settle easily. Exploration and play is unhurried within the calm atmosphere. Teachers unobtrusively enable individuals to investigate their surroundings and purposefully engage in the curriculum. Resources reflect their current and emerging interests. Transition from Morimori to the older children&rsquo;s room is carefully managed.</p><p>Planning responds to individual children&rsquo;s interests and teachers&rsquo; observations. Although it is evident that the children lead their learning, programme planning documentation does not always show this. Teachers frequently record succinct learning stories that illustrate the focus on individual interests and strengths. The stories are attractively presented. The strong links with parents and wh&#257;nau enable home aspirations to be part of the curriculum. Te reo M&#257;ori and Tongan language are used regularly in learning stories strengthening, the link between home and the centre.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners. They regularly meet to discuss developments and to ensure shared understandings of their roles and responsibilities. The manager and teachers recognise that strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation practice is their next step.</p><p>Staff work strongly as a cohesive team. They are regularly appraised, based on the Registered Teacher Criteria. The manager should ensure appraisals are rigorous and developmental areas have links to appropriate professional development.</p><p>The manager and committee, through policies and meetings take care to ensure staff have a sound knowledge and understanding of health and safety procedures, including privacy and confidentiality.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manaaki Tamariki Childcare and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manaaki Tamariki Childcare and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
