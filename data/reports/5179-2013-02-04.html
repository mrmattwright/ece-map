<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Huntly Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Huntly Kindergarten is situated in the northern Waikato town of Huntly and caters for preschool children aged over two years old. Twenty-six of the 57 children on the roll are identified as M&#257;ori. The kindergarten offers a six-hour programme on four days of the week and a morning session on Wednesdays. Families associated with the kindergarten come from the town and surrounding country districts. A dedicated parent committee organises fund-raising activities and social events.</p><p>The 2010 ERO review found that the head teacher demonstrated effective leadership and teachers provided high-quality education for children. There was a need to continue developing planning, assessment and self review. Since then, teachers have engaged in learning and development to improve these areas of professional practice.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy emphasises empowering children to realise their potential. Priorities include provision of:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities to develop literacy and mathematical skills in all curriculum areas</li>
<li>a programme that is enriching, challenging and meaningful in partnership with parents, wh&#257;nau and the community</li>
<li>a richly resourced learning environment that encourages enquiry and promotes skill development</li>
<li>fun and challenge where learning and development are woven into play, exploration, positive guidance and routines</li>
<li>an environment that is equitable for gender, race, culture, ability and creed.</li>
</ul><p>These aspects of the philosophy are strongly reflected in the programme provided for children.</p><p>Teachers maximise opportunities for integrating bicultural perspectives and facilitating smooth transitions to school. They make very good use of equity funding from the Ministry of Education to support children&rsquo;s equitable access to stimulating early childhood education.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Effective teaching practices engage children in a wide range of learning experiences. These practices include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong focus on integrating te reo M&#257;ori and other bicultural perspectives throughout the programme and environment</li>
<li>providing meaningful opportunities to explore literacy, mathematics, science and technology skills and concepts</li>
<li>inquiry focused teaching where learning and problem solving are shared between teachers and children</li>
<li>maintaining respectful, responsive interactions and fostering tuakana-teina relationships among children.</li>
</ul><p>Children are confident and enthusiastic learners. They are empowered to make decisions about their learning and trusted to take manageable risks.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum effectively reflects its philosophy. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and learning needs. Programme planning is visible to children so that they are able to revisit, discuss and further develop their interests and ideas. Teachers&rsquo; professional development is increasing their understanding of assessment to identify children&rsquo;s learning and demonstrate progress.</p><p>The learning environment strongly promotes and supports the curriculum. Children have ready access to a wide range of interesting resources and equipment for indoor and outdoor activities and challenges. Learning and play areas are flexibly arranged by teachers and children and regularly reviewed and updated. An atmosphere of engagement, purpose and fun is sustained.</p><p>Parents are well informed of the kindergarten programme through attractive profile books, photographic wall displays, formal and informal discussions with teachers, and regular newsletters. Teachers are beginning to incorporate meaningful contributions from both parents and children into planning and assessment processes.</p><p>The head teacher provides collaborative, reflective leadership. She is a very good role model of effective early childhood teaching practice. Her promotion of effective positive guidance strategies influences a positive tone throughout the kindergarten.</p><p>The Central North Island Kindergarten Association provides effective governance and strategic direction. The association places high value on promoting success for M&#257;ori, as M&#257;ori, through training initiatives for staff. The association employs a knowledgeable professional leader who effectively monitors teaching practices and regulatory compliance. She has provided teachers with honest and constructive feedback that has resulted in relevant staff professional development, improved teaching practices and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that areas for further development and review are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure annual planning provides an explicit basis for development and review</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes so that they focus on positive improvements for children</li>
<li>continue professional development in assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Huntly Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
