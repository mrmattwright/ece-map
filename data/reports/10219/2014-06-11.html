<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p>
<p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p>
<h4>Terms of Reference</h4>
<p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Shining Lights Christian Preschool governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2013 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the quality of the education programme, especially for priority learners</li>
<li>the quality of management processes, including self review and communication and</li>
<li>any other issues that arise in the course of this review.</li>
</ul>
<a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The centre is now well placed to continue improving its performance to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Shining Lights Christian Preschool was established as a multicultural, family-focused centre. Teachers are committed to serving the Grey Lynn community by providing affordable, quality, Christian-based childcare.</p>
<p>The centre is licensed for 25 children including up to eight children under the age of two. Although there is a separate area for the younger children, they spend most of the day playing and learning with the older age group.</p>
<p>Since the 2013 ERO review, a new manager has been appointed to oversee the running of the centre. She works with the new head teacher to support and lead the teaching team. An experienced teacher has also joined the staff.</p>
<p>The 2013 ERO report identified several areas that needed to be addressed at the preschool to improve the quality of the education and care of children and the management of the centre. Significant progress has been made in these areas.</p>
<h4>Areas of progress</h4>
<p>Considerable work has been done since the 2013 ERO review to improve the quality of care and education of children. The new manager and head teacher are working effectively with staff and parents to support ongoing developments.</p>
<p>Teachers have reflected on how to strengthen their roles in extending children&rsquo;s learning and are being supported by targeted professional development. Improved planning helps teachers to develop an education programme that responds to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers regularly discuss their teaching and children&rsquo;s learning. They are currently exploring ways of involving parents in planning, including the use of electronic communications.</p>
<p>The care and education of infants and toddlers has been improved. A specified teacher takes the overall responsibility for children up to the age of two. While she is responsible for planning and resourcing their programme, all teachers interact with the young children in positive and supportive ways.</p>
<p>The environment now works more effectively to support children&rsquo;s education and well being. There are pleasant spaces where children can play without unnecessary interruption and can access resources to support their play.</p>
<p>Newly appointed staff have brought additional ideas about providing more challenging learning experiences for children. Teachers make good use of conversations with children to support their language development and their thinking. The manager has purchased new equipment and resources that provides additional challenge.</p>
<p>Children have many opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills as they play. Teachers share books with children and help them to understand the purpose of reading and writing.</p>
<p>The new manager is improving management systems. Policies are being reviewed to ensure that they guide centre operations more effectively. Strategic planning is being developed and is well supported by improved self review. Progress has been made in establishing a more effective appraisal system.</p>
<p>The centre staff have developed effective self-review processes that help to identify and address ways to improve the services provided at the preschool. Self review includes thoroughly planned reviews as well as regular reflections on teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Areas for further improvement</h4>
<p>With ERO, the centre manager and head teacher have identified some areas for further improvement. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening the appraisal system to include goal setting and formative feedback to teachers and the head teacher</li>
<li>developing with teachers a teaching philosophy that guides them in their approach to their teaching</li>
<li>continuing to review planning and assessment approaches and encouraging greater participation by parents</li>
<li>developing a management plan to ensure that regular management tasks and centre events are completed at appropriate times during the year.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3&nbsp;Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
