</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Shoots Children‚Äôs Centre (Papamoa) opened in 2011 and is located on the outskirts of Papamoa in the Bay of Plenty. The well-designed, purpose-built facility has a focus on natural resources and environmental sustainability that reflects the philosophy of the owners. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for up to 100 children including up to 35 aged under two. Of the 109 children currently enrolled, 17 are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is privately owned by two directors who also own and govern other centres in Auckland and Hamilton. A centre manager is employed to oversee day-to-day operations. She is supported by two head teachers, who are responsible for daily programmes in the separate infants/toddlers and older children‚Äôs play areas. There is a strong emphasis on employing and retaining qualified, registered teachers. This is the first ERO review for this service</p><p>The centre‚Äôs values include integrity, having fun, creating an environment that feels right for children and promoting innovation based on new ideas and research. Along with agreed understandings about curriculum, these values guide the philosophy statements which have been developed for each age group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>High-quality teaching practices are evident in many aspects of the programme. Teachers work responsively with children using open questioning to extend their learning. They deliberately facilitate children‚Äôs sustained engagement in meaningful play and provide a range of opportunities for creative expression. Bicultural perspectives are increasingly evident.</p><p>The programme is effectively based on children‚Äôs interests and learning needs. Spacious and innovatively resourced indoor and outdoor areas are designed to stimulate exploration. Resources and equipment offer children a wide range of suitable choices that foster learning through play. Portfolio entries are regularly monitored to ensure they meet requirements and provide parents/whƒÅnau with useful information. Parents/whƒÅnau receive regular updates about the centre programme and activities through a range of media options. They are welcome at the centre and encouraged to participate in their children‚Äôs learning. Teachers know children and families well.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing, respectful and caring relationships with teachers in a calm, family-like environment. Established processes for transitioning children into the centre ensure they remain settled and have a positive relationship with primary caregivers. Teachers respect children‚Äôs natural rhythms and empower them to engage in independent and social activities of their choice. Oral language is encouraged through responsive communication and story reading. There is an established whakatau practice for transition into the preschool area.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and science concepts are effectively integrated within older children‚Äôs play. There is a strong focus on environmental sustainability and recognising children‚Äôs learning styles. Children are encouraged to explore and take responsibility for managing their own learning and problem solving. Cultural diversity is affirmed and celebrated. Children with special needs are settled and well integrated. Processes to ensure smooth transition to school are continuing to develop as teachers become more familiar with schools in the local community.</p><p>The directors and centre director provide strong professional leadership. Teachers are actively encouraged to reflect on their practices and share good practice with one another. Their professional knowledge is continually developed within a community of professional learning, reading and discussion. Self review is effective in sustaining a momentum of continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directors have identified that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to integrate MƒÅori language and culture across the centre</li>
<li>encourage teachers to share new ideas and effective practices with the wider early childhood education community</li>
<li>further align systems for strategic and annual planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Shoots Childrens Centre (Papamoa) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of New Shoots Childrens Centre (Papamoa) will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
