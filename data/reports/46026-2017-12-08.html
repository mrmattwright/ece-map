</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Steps is a privately owned all-day early childhood service. It is located in the rural South Waikato village of Whakamaru, near Mangakino. It provides education and care for up to 50 children aged from three months to school age.</p><p>The management structure includes two centre directors and two team leaders. Most of the staff are qualified and registered teachers who have long-standing connections with local families and the community. One teacher holds Te Kohanga Reo Whakapakari Tinorangatiratanga qualification and leads the teaching team in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practice.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014 leaders and teachers have amalgamated the two age-based learning spaces and now provide one learning space where older and younger children learn together. Internal evaluation systems for monitoring and improving centre practices have been strengthened, and on-line child assessment portfolios have been introduced.</p><p>The centre's vision and values for quality education and care are documented in the centre philosophy. Leaders and teachers prioritise positive relationships and working in partnership with children and families, in promoting effective teaching and learning. Whanaungatanga (relationships) and kaitiakitanga (care and protection of the environment) are the key values underpinning centre culture. The centre has a focus on incorporating te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, which is reflected in its mission statement 'Ako, kata, tƒÅkaro, te Poutama o te Kiwi-learn, laugh, play the Kiwi Steps way'.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kiwi Steps is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children. Teachers successfully enact the centres' vision and values. Children and their whƒÅnau enjoy highly respectful and trusting relationships with staff. Teachers are strong advocates for children and their whƒÅnau. Management has practices in place so children can have access to the centre and fully participate in programme experiences. Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging is strongly nurtured through positive interactions and the environment.</p><p>Children experience an inclusive curriculum. Teachers are highly responsive to children's interests, strengths and abilities. They plan interesting and challenging experiences for both group and individual learning. The learning environment is purposefully organised. Children access high-quality resources in literacy, mathematics, science and other curriculum areas. Children confidently engage in sustained and complex learning through their play.</p><p>Children's learning is being effectively extended by teachers. They have many opportunities to think critically, use their imagination and be creative. Teachers view children as capable leaders and learners. Children confidently lead and take responsibility for their own learning. They have leadership experiences through tuakana tenia relationships, where they share their strengths and knowledge to support others learning. Teachers extend children's thinking and build on their knowledge using intentional teaching strategies.</p><p>Children's language, culture and identity is valued and celebrated. Partnerships and open communication with whƒÅnau lead to reciprocal information sharing around culture, interests and home experiences. Teachers skilfully respond and maintain children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity. Children are proud to share their culture. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are well integrated throughout the daily programme. All children benefit from these rich experiences and MƒÅori children are well supported to experience success as MƒÅori.</p><p>Individual child assessment portfolios are used well to support teaching and learning processes. Teachers have established centre systems that enable whƒÅnau to be actively engaged in children's education. Assessment portfolios are accessible to parents and include multiple perspectives of children's successes and progress. Teachers are continually developing assessment practices to show MƒÅori children's connections to their whakapapa and learning. Children's holistic development is well supported.</p><p>The centre has some good systems for evaluating the quality of education. Strategic goals are becoming more specific. Leaders plan to evaluate the older children's programme to align practice more with the centre's philosophy values for learning. Teachers are currently inquiring into the revised early childhood curriculum<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017, and further implementing the document in centre practices. These processes and practices focus on positive outcomes for children, and lead to continual improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre now needs to strengthen internal evaluation practices by aligning centre specific strategic goals with long-term planned reviews. This should assist leaders and teachers to effectively evaluate how well they are achieving the centre vision, goals and philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Steps completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Steps will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>8 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
