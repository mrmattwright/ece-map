</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avondale Christian Kindergarten is a not-for-profit education and care service operated by the Trust Board of the Reformed Church of Avondale. The kindergarten is run by a management committee. All teachers are qualified and registered. The kindergarten provides for up to 50 children over two years of age.</p><p>Children enrolled are from an increasingly wide range of cultural backgrounds. Children are supported to learn to speak English, as the common centre language. Teachers explain about teaching and kindergarten practices to families in their home languages. Centre leaders arrange kindergarten events, celebrations and meetings to encourage the participation of children, parents and whānau in the kindergarten community.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report highlighted positive features in the kindergarten that continue to be strongly evident. Leaders and teachers have responded positively to, and have continued to strengthen practices in, development priorities noted in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is based on Christian values and beliefs, and inclusion. It affirms children as independent learners. The philosophy also aligns well with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Intended outcomes related to the philosophy are planned for in strategic planning, and are implemented in the programme.</p><p>Children observed were friendly, engaged, independent learners. They confidently contributed in group discussions and freely expressed their ideas. Children can make choices and use the learning environment to support their interests. They are encouraged to lead and extend their own learning.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor learning environments are inviting, well resourced, organised and readily accessible to children. Outdoor environments provide a broad range of experiences to promote children's physical development and imagination, interest in natural science, and learning about environmental sustainability.</p><p>Teachers develop trusting relationships and partnerships with parents, who have many opportunities to share their aspirations for their children's learning. Parents are welcome to spend time in the kindergarten and contribute to the programme.</p><p>The curriculum has a strong bicultural focus. Teachers are guided by the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in their relationships with children, and partnerships with parents. Children have worked with teachers to develop a kindergarten treaty<strong>. </strong>They respectfully take responsibility and care for the environment. Tuakana/teina relationships are encouraged and support children's wellbeing. Children and teachers are becoming more aware of others' cultural beliefs, values and customs.</p><p>Teachers view children as holistic learners and they involve children cognitively, spiritually and physically in their own learning. Children learn literacy and numeracy skills and concepts in the context of play. Meaningful individual assessment records show children's interests and learningprogress at the kindergarten.</p><p>The centre is well led. Efficient and relevant governance and management systems are evident in practice. Parents and teachers are encouraged to contribute to the kindergarten's evaluation and planning processes. The kindergarten has a comprehensive policy base which is reviewed regularly. Meaningful strategic planning is implemented and self-review processes are robust and effective<strong>. </strong></p><p>Leaders are building a professional learning culture among staff. Teachers research topics of interest as part of their ongoing evaluation. They share their findings and new learning with the teaching team to build the team's knowledge and capability. Mentoring through appraisal processes is also developing teachers' leadership skills. Processes are in place to help teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices.</p><p>Teachers have attended training courses to refresh their teaching practices when working with toddlers. They recognise the importance of helping children develop language skills and competence in the English language to aid their learning journey.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have developed appropriate plans to further:</p><ul>
<li>support children to lead their own learning</li>
<li>strengthen the teaching team's professional learning culture</li>
<li>encourage Pacific families to share their aspirations with teachers and contribute to planning for their children's learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avondale Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avondale Christian Kindergarten will be in four years. </p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="[sitetree_link,id=]">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
