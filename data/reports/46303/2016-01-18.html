</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Farmhouse Preschool Karaka is a privately owned rural preschool set on a large property in Karaka. It opened in 2014 as a purpose built centre. It provides all day education and care service for up to 30 children over two years of age. The centre owner also manages Farmhouse Preschool Patumahoe. Management and administration systems are the same across the two centres. The centre manager provides strong professional leadership and mentors teachers in both centres. There are shared opportunities for professional development and centre events. The two centres work collaboratively to provide families with an early childhood education that meets their child‚Äôs needs and family requirements. This is the first review of the centre.</p><p>The centre is family orientated and child focused. Key aspects of the centre philosophy are connections to the rural community and fostering learning through play. All teachers are qualified and registered. Good communication and relationships with parents and useful networks in the community have been developed. There is a high level of parent satisfaction and appreciation of the centre, teachers and programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers respect children as competent learners and value their play. Interactions with children are consistently affirming and supportive. Teachers listen carefully to children, engage them in rich conversation and offer resources and suggestions for extending their play. Routines and transitions are flexible and child-focused. They encourage children to make choices, try out new activities and join in group play. Children have fun, engage in sustained play and are eager to learn.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively together to provide a very good quality, child led programme underpinned by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and their teaching philosophy. Their respect for child-initiated play, environmental sustainability and exploration is evident in the programme. High expectations and meaningful learning opportunities contribute positively to children‚Äòs developing self esteem and independence. Children‚Äôs assessment portfolios are very good records of individual children‚Äôs learning journey.</p><p>Respectful and responsive relationships underpin the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere in the centre. Teachers incorporate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in natural ways and have a genuine commitment to developing a more bicultural curriculum. They have a clear understanding of individual children‚Äôs interests, strengths and preferences. Teachers are committed to the principle of inclusion and demonstrate skills and empathy in this area.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage parent and whƒÅnau partnership in children‚Äôs learning and development. They keep them well informed, and encourage them to share their knowledge and ideas. Teachers have strong connections with the community, take part in local events and have good relationships with local schools. Children‚Äôs transition to school is effectively supported.</p><p>Children are capable, caring and confident learners. They learn in a well resourced, carefully organised, attractive environment that reflects the rural, environment and nurtures their sense of belonging. Farm animals and young orchards in the surrounding paddocks add to the emphasis on connections to the outdoors. Children participate, explore and make discoveries at an unhurried pace.</p><p>Children are imaginative, play cooperatively and engage in sustained play. They have many opportunities to be physically active, have leadership experience and challenge in a carefully planned balance of structure and play. Teachers integrate aspects of science, literacy, mathematics and technology in authentic contexts. Children‚Äôs creativity and imagination is nurtured as is their social competence.</p><p><span>Centre leaders have a strong commitment to providing a high quality service and continuing with ongoing improvement.</span> The centre is well managed with effective administration systems in place. Teachers work as a collegial, cohesive team. The centre manager is supportive of teachers, aware of their strengths, and encourages their leadership abilities. The robust appraisal process supports teachers in their <span>culture of teacher reflection and in further developing teaching as inquiry.</span></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders <span>agree that next steps could include</span>:</p><ul>
<li>developing a more robust process of documented self review that is more collaborative, evaluative and focused on outcomes for children</li>
<li>continuing to encourage parent involvement in the curriculum</li>
<li>strengthening opportunities for children to revisit their learning</li>
<li>reviewing how effectively cultural diversity is responded to in ways that promote children‚Äôs language, culture and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Farmhouse Preschool Karaka completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Farmhouse Preschool Karaka will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
