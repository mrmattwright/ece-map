</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A Place to Grow is a privately owned home-based education and care service operating in Feilding. It is licensed for 80 children, including 80 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review, 18 educators provide education and care for 63 children and 24 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The two managers of the service also undertake the roles of visiting teachers, supporting in-home educators to provide care and learning programmes for children. Both are qualified and registered teachers. They established a Licensed Quality Network, A Place to Grow 2, in 2017, employing another registered teacher.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of children developing and learning in safe, inclusive and nurturing environments. The vision is promoted through providing free-play learning opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A Place to Grow has sustained and continued to build its performance management, educator capability and positive learning outcomes for children, since the March 2016 ERO report. Managers and educators are focused on ensuring equity for all children through their provision of learning opportunities. A professional, improvement-focused culture, characterised by support and care is evident.</p><p>Children have settled environments that develop and promote their confidence, communication, participation and wellbeing. Organised events for children offer a range of learning experiences in educators‚Äô homes and in the local community. A Place to Grow playgroups and regular planned outings to the gymnasium and football sessions provide ongoing learning, different challenges and social opportunities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported in developing positive interactions with other children and adults. Educators, in individual children's daily records and journals, document information, progress and areas for development for each child. These are shared with children, families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>An inclusive approach focuses on removing barriers to the participation of children with additional learning in the service. They are welcomed and well supported. Leaders and educators work relentlessly to support children and their families. Support from external agencies assists educators to meet the needs of those children with additional needs.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to children's interests, strengths and preferences. The use of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, supports educators in their understanding about assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. Visiting teachers' conversations and documented observations of educators and children contribute to individual learning stories.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics, arts, science and physical play are highlighted through children's assessment narratives. Educators record their dispositions, progress, strengths and interests and areas for development. They draw from service exemplars to guide their analysis and response to children's learning and information about the values of play. Visiting teachers provide educators with robust feedback to support children's learning experiences and outcomes.</p><p>A bicultural curriculum is evident. The managers have sourced MƒÅori expertise to develop and build their Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practice. The service has identified that te ao MƒÅori knowledge, understandings and connections to this place are areas to continue to build. ERO's evaluation affirms this development need.</p><p>A considered approach supports the placement of children to ensure families and educators are matched to support children's wellbeing. A Place to Grow strives to include parents‚Äô aspirations, input, participation and feedback. This continues to be an appropriate ongoing focus to build stronger relationships between educators, families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Opportunities for educators to develop their knowledge are promoted. Suitable guidelines support: consistent understanding of expectations for roles and responsibilities at visiting teacher and educator levels; and educator engagement in respectful and responsive relationships with children and families.</p><p>Visiting teachers provide ongoing guidance to improve practice including an effective induction process and regular involvement in professional learning. Leaders have promoted development in <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em> to build and strengthen educator knowledge, understanding and implementation. Monthly visits to children and educators ensure targeted input and support from the visiting teachers.</p><p>Managers have clearly documented and consistent systems to monitor the quality of children‚Äôs education, care, safety and wellbeing. Health and safety processes are sound and are in place to assist daily operation. At regular weekly management meetings, leaders include professional teaching and learning practices and outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review for accountability and improvement is in place. Service leaders should continue to build knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation to guide improvement. The review framework should highlight: focus questions; indicators; analysis and evaluation. The service identifies developing internal evaluation as a next step, confirmed by ERO's findings.</p><p>A sound framework supports inquiry within appraisal and leads to positive change and improvement for teaching and learning. Managers should review and refine the current documentation gathered to continue to support educators to promote positive practices for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the service needs to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>te ao MƒÅori knowledge and understandings, and connections to this place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation, to effectively review the quality of teaching practice and programmes and the impact of actions on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal, reviewing and refining the current system to ensure the focus is on improved practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of A Place to Grow completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A Place to Grow will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>23 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
