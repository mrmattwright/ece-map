</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>York Street Kindergarten is located in Masterton. It is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. This is the first review for this kindergarten since the merger.</p><p>The kindergarten provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. Six-hour daily sessions are offered, five days a week. It is licensed for up to 40 children. At the time of this evaluation, 15 MƒÅori children were enrolled.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered. The programme is further assisted by support staff.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the Wellington association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children‚Äôs learning. Its introduction within the exRimutaka Kindergartens occurred during 2015, with kindergartens adapting it to respond to their community.</p><p>The August 2013 ERO report for the kindergarten identified that self review, learning partnerships with Pacific families and assessment, planning and evaluation needed strengthening. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Many aspects of the kindergarten's philosophy are evident in practice. Children are respectful and caring of the learning environment and others. Curiosity, independence, having fun and learning together are promoted and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They work alongside them to support and extend their learning. Relationships are warm and responsive. Literacy and mathematics are meaningfully integrated into the context of play.</p><p>The kindergarten's programme has a focus on promoting a sustainable environment to help extend children's learning. Leaders and teachers have identified the need to be more responsive to younger children who attend the centre. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>A welcoming environment supports positive relationships with whƒÅnau. Celebrating MƒÅori children's culture, language and identity is a key feature. Promotion of te ao MƒÅori is evident in the programme. An inviting outdoor learning environment reflects te ao MƒÅori kaupapa, celebrating the local maunga, awa and takutai moana of Masterton. Developing links with hap≈´ and iwi whƒÅnau continues to be a focus for the kindergarten.</p><p>Information from individual and group assessment is used to plan the curriculum. Children are part of a whƒÅnau group and planning is based on their interests and ideas. More specific planning for children as individuals, that includes learning outcomes and teaching strategies, should assist teachers to clearly identify the next learning steps for each child.</p><p>Children's portfolios highlight their participation in the programme, what they know, and their interests and progress over time. An online assessment tool enables parents to contribute more frequently to their child‚Äôs learning profile.</p><p>Teachers are improvement focused. They are reflective, and regularly meet to share ideas about teaching and learning. The association is providing support to build teachers' evaluative understanding and capability to help them to measure how positively their practices impact on children's learning.</p><p>The head teacher provides experienced and effective leadership. Teachers are encouraged to further develop expertise and experience as leaders.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. They complete an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focussed goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for York Street Kindergarten, to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a more responsive programme that supports younger children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' understanding of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of York Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of York Street Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 December 2016¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
