</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avalon Kindergarten is located in Hutt City and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. Morning sessions are offered each day. Three days a week there is the option of an extended six- hour day. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 44 children.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report identified areas requiring further development. These include assessment, planning and evaluation, self review, appraisal and the bicultural programme. Appropriate professional learning and development has been accessed to improve aspects of practice. Teachers are committed to the ongoing acquisition of professional knowledge.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergartens reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in sustained play and learning in a free play programme. Routines provide a useful structure for the day and give children a sense of security in knowing what will happen next. Teachers know children well within the context of their families. The annual cycle of regular events contributes to their sense of belonging. A calm atmosphere supports children&rsquo;s purposeful engagement in the curriculum.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum has been a recent self review focus. The outcome has been to strengthen teachers&rsquo; practice and understanding of ways to promote te ao M&#257;ori in the curriculum. Teachers are committed to ongoing learning in this area. Te reo M&#257;ori is used well during routine times. A next step is for teachers to further integrate the use of te reo M&#257;ori throughout the early childhood programme. Success for M&#257;ori and Pacific families should be further enhanced through consulting with parents about their cultural aspirations they may have for their child.</p><p>Regular and informative entries in children&rsquo;s profiles highlight their participation and engagement in the programme. Currently, assessment practice does not clearly align with the expectations of the association&rsquo;s quality practice statement. Reflecting these expectations is a key next step.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers access external agencies where appropriate. Assessment documentation should better reflect the shared intentions identified in the child&rsquo;s individual development plan and highlight progress for their family.</p><p>The curriculum is extended through regular excursions into the local community and by visitors to the kindergarten. Formal planning and ongoing evaluation of events, regular occurrences and children&rsquo;s interests should strengthen the learning programme.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s transition to school is supported through collaborative relationships with local schools. An informative range of assessment information is provided to the school about the child&rsquo;s strengths, interests and learning dispositions.</p><p>A useful framework guides the successful implementation of review and evaluation in the kindergarten. Teachers should continue to build their capacity to evaluate their practice through this process.</p><p>The approach to leadership is collaborative and supportive. Emergent leadership is encouraged and builds on teacher&rsquo;s strengths and interests.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. Leaders should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to provide more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to M&#257;ori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These provide information about how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements, and at times, make recommendations. These reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt City Kindergartens. ERO identified that within the current operating model the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified that priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>consulting with parents about cultural aspirations to promote success for M&#257;ori and Pacific learners</li>
<li>improving the quality assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>building the evaluative aspect of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to M&#257;ori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avalon Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avalon Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title="">Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 June 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
