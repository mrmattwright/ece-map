</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park St Heliers was established as the first of a chain of Bear Park Ltd and Bear Park Franchise Systems Ltd services. All of the Bear Park centres are led by the Bear Park Franchisor and the Bear Park pedagogical team. An interlinking set of policies, procedures and systems guides the centres and provides continuity and reassurance about the quality of programmes for children.</p><p>Bear Park St Heliers operates in two adjoining houses. These have been modified to provide functional space for the Infant, Toddler and Preschool rooms. These environments provide education and care for up to 60 children including 20 under two. Parents are able to make choices about the numbers of days and hours that their children attend.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is the over-arching statement prepared for Bear Park centres. It refers to the inspiration taken from the values and beliefs of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. The philosophy is strongly linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers of the infants and toddlers are influenced by the Resources for Infant Educators (RIE) philosophy.</p><p>Bear Park St Heliers is a franchised centre, managed for the franchisees by a qualified early childhood teacher. Day-to-day management of the two houses is the responsibility of supervisors who lead teams of qualified teachers and experienced additional staff.</p><p>As mentioned in the 2013 ERO report, teachers continue to build partnerships with parents/whƒÅnau, and to further strengthen the bicultural values they have established. The teaching team have also continued to reflect upon and refine self-review practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three early childhood centre reviews in the Bear Park Childcare Centres organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily at the start of the day, talking eagerly to teachers and finding activities they want to explore. Friendships between children are obvious and they play in collaborative and friendly groups. Children are able to engage in self-selected free play for prolonged periods during the day.</p><p>A priority for the teachers is to build partnerships with children and their families. Relationships with children are warm and positive. Teachers frequently engage children in conversations about their emerging interests and their home lives. Parents are confident and comfortable in the centre and their conversations with teachers are relaxed and cheerful.</p><p>Teachers provide many opportunities for children to explore, investigate and test their own theories and those promoted by teachers. There are also many opportunities for children to discuss their activities and make decisions. Meeting times with children during the day are increasingly about children sharing their ideas. They help to strengthen children's confidence and support their investigation about selected topics.</p><p>Infants and toddlers settle easily into the lively and busy environment. Teachers work closely with them, paying attention to their beginning language and non-verbal cues. Routines are responsive and cheerfully managed. The day includes opportunities for these children to be outdoors for prolonged periods, and to make choices about their play.</p><p>Environments are thoughtfully set up to provoke exploration and include high quality natural resources. Teachers carefully consider ways of supporting children's literacy and numeracy knowledge. Beautiful and interesting resources are stored so as to be easily accessible. Children help to maintain and care for the environment as part of the everyday programmes.</p><p>Parents have many opportunities to talk to teachers about their children. Twice yearly formal meetings and day-to-day conversations enable teachers to gather information about children and to respond in programme planning. Teachers also share information about children's time in the centre both on-line and documented other ways.</p><p>The formation of a representative parent committee has increased parent participation in the review of policies and procedures, and in decision making about the programmes. This group meets regularly.</p><p>There has been a strong focus throughout Bear Park centres on increasing teachers' understanding of and knowledge about bicultural practices. This has included many opportunities for teachers who are more competent and confident in te ao MƒÅori to share with and mentor their peers. There have also been opportunities for professional learning and development from external speakers. This has made a significant difference to the amount of te reo MƒÅori spoken and the recognition of tikanga MƒÅori in the centre.</p><p>Teacher keep extensive documentation about children, the programme and self review. Some of this documentation is linked to the over-arching four year strategic plan. This enables teachers each month to review the ways in which they meet the strategic goals. Teachers may find it useful, as part of regular strategic plan review, to deepen their focus on ways to enhance teaching, and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The recently formed pedagogical team, which includes the franchisee, provides ongoing support and advice for Bear Park centres. The team meets regularly to discuss and make decisions about professional development and centre progress. This team sets the direction for the organisation and supports development. The management team recruits, manages and develops teachers' competency well. The strategic placement of teachers ensures support and stronger teamwork to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the focus of ongoing critical reflection could include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>creating a stronger, more meaningful emphasis on bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effectiveness of current teaching practices for children from diverse cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening shared leadership as a way of supporting teachers to grow professionally.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park St Heliers completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park St Heliers will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
