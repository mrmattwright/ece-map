</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kingsway Preschool in Red Beach caters for children and families in Red Beach and the wider Hibiscus Coast community. It provides education and care for up to 30 children aged two to five years, with sessional, full day or extended day options for families. The roll includes a small number of Māori and Pacific children, as well as other ethnicities.</p><p>The centre is one of two operated by the directors of Kingsway Educational Services Limited. A recently appointed team leader leads curriculum developments and mentors teachers. The centre has two indoor play areas and a very spacious outdoor area.</p><p>The philosophy is based on a special Christian character and nurturing relationships that foster respect, value diversity and promote acceptance. It emphasises the provision of a safe, interactive and fun learning environment.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified positive aspects including capable leadership, a collaborative and committed teaching team, a culture of child-initiated learning and authentic partnerships with families. These positive features have been maintained. Key next steps included strengthening bicultural practices, strategic planning and self review. Programme planning, assessment and evaluation were also noted as areas that could be improved. Good progress has been made in each of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging and are settled in the centre. They have caring and respectful relationships with adults and their friends. Children independently select resources and lead their own learning. They enjoy a programme that gives them time to explore and engage in self-directed learning for long periods.</p><p>Caring teachers know children well and work alongside them to support their learning. They respect children’s space, choices and learning. Creativity, early literacy, mathematics and science concepts are well integrated in children’s programmes.</p><p>The learning environment has clearly defined curriculum areas, good opportunities for physical play and a wide range of learning opportunities for children. Teachers integrate te reo Māori in the programme well. They have very good links with the wider community.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be involved in their children’s learning at the centre. Teachers provide many opportunities for families to participate in the programme, contribute their views for their children's learning and be aware of their children’s progress. Parents who spoke with ERO appreciate that teachers listen to their aspirations and respond to their children’s strengths.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed and improved programme planning and assessment practices. They value input and ideas from children and parents to inform planning. The use of teachers' perspectives in planning and assessment has strengthened teacher reflection about the effectiveness of their teaching practices. The special Christian character and bicultural practices underpin curriculum planning and are evident in the environment. Teachers plan together and have a strong focus on extending children's learning.</p><p>Very good processes are in place to notice, recognise and respond to children’s emerging interests. Teachers plan activities and provide opportunities that are meaningful and relevant for children. Assessment records include clear links to children's dispositions for learning and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. There are good examples of assessment records that show children's learning progress over time.</p><p>Leadership is highly effective. The centre manager has worked with teachers to build a professional team culture. She recognises and grows leadership among staff. Teachers are committed to professional learning to improve their practice. They have shared responsibilities to achieve outcomes identified in the centre's strategic and annual plans.</p><p>Directors provide good guidance for the centre manager. A sound policy and management framework, including robust appraisal processes and useful internal evaluation systems, supports continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' strategies for challenging children's thinking, and promoting problem solving and complex play</p>
</li>
<li>providing further information to parents about transition to school, and about promoting early literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording learning outcomes and teaching strategies to increase teachers' focus on the impact of their practice on children's learning. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kingsway Pre-School - Red Beach completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kingsway Pre-School - Red Beach will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>15 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
