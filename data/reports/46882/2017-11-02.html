</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten in Hastings was opened in November 2015. It is one of three early learning services under common private ownership. It caters for up to 120 children, including 40 up to the age of two years. Of the 60 children enrolled, 11 are MƒÅori.</p><p>Two directors manage the financial, marketing and business aspects of the service. The centre and education manager is responsible for the operation of the centre, with the support of two head teachers. The majority of teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The new purpose-built centre is divided into three separate learning spaces designed specifically for different age groups. There is a focus on using natural and open-ended resources.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises Christian principles and values such as compassion, patience, honesty, respect and kindness.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy and values are highly evident in practice. There is an explicit focus on integrating the values throughout the programme. A strong sense of belonging for children, families and whƒÅnau is fostered through positive, respectful and responsive relationships. Having fun as part of the learning process is highly valued.</p><p>Children follow their interests and engage in self-initiated play. Access to a wide range of resources and activities promotes their exploration, creativity, physical activity and development of problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers are intentional in the way they recognise and respond to opportunities to engage in, and extend children's learning. As a result, children are confident learners and able to sustain their play for long periods. Early literacy, mathematics and science development is meaningfully integrated into learning contexts. Teachers continue to enhance te ao MƒÅori throughout the programme.</p><p>Planning for learning is responsive to individual children's and group interests. Through ongoing observation of children at play, teachers collaboratively identify strategies to promote learning. Their progress is regularly assessed and shared with parents and whƒÅnau through learning stories and anecdotal notes. Profile books are a valuable record of children's learning and participation in the programme. These include learning plans and evaluations which record children's progress and achievement over time.</p><p>Parents' aspirations for their children's learning are valued. An online programme and other forms of technology are supporting two-way communication between parents and teachers, and the celebration of children's learning.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are nurtured in a calm, stress-free environment where they can actively explore and investigate. Teachers are attuned to infants' non-verbal cues and respond sensitively to each child's needs and preferences.</p><p>Children's transitions into, through and out of the centre are supported by well-considered systems and processes and relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. A programme for four-year-olds is focused on developing competencies that are most likely to support their successful transition to school.</p><p>Children requiring additional learning support are well provided for through inclusive practices and positive relationships with parents, whƒÅnau, and external agencies. Responsive planning supports their full participation in the programme alongside their peers.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. A highly reflective culture is evident. The skills and strengths of individuals are acknowledged and valued. Emergent leadership is promoted. The newly implemented appraisal process is aligned to updated legislative requirements and provides opportunities for teachers to inquire into their practice. Continuing to improve their understanding and use of inquiry should support them to measure the impact of their teaching practices on outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. Internal evaluation is developing as a means to measure the impact of processes and practices on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that teachers should continue to strengthen their understanding and use of inquiry and internal evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten - Hastings completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten - Hastings will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>2 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
