<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Maungaraki Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The effective and collaborative leadership and high level of commitment from members, along with continuing support of the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), should enable it to sustain and improve its good practice.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person, employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association&rsquo;s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs four mixed-age sessions with paid supervisors and one SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education) session each week. There is a strong focus on supporting induction and training of new members. The roll is full and sessions have high adult to child ratios.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations</em> <em>2008</em>. Significant refurbishment of the property was undertaken in preparation for relicensing. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is strongly reflected in the programme. The values of building relationships between families, children self-selecting their play and having fun, are emphasised. Members&rsquo; inclusive and well considered approach provides good support for a diverse range of learning needs. All children are encouraged to investigate, explore, and interact with others. Adults are responsive and have an appropriate focus on promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and social learning. Children&rsquo;s creativity and self-expression are encouraged. Children aged up to two years actively engage in the programme. Members integrate literacy, numeracy and science into the programme in the context of play.</p><p>Members give appropriate consideration to the learning needs of older children. They are trialling a special programme for them, which is integrated into the mixed-age session. This is supported by experienced supervisors and an extended range of resources especially for this age group. Supporting families transitioning to school is an area identified by members as needing development in the future.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials for children to access. The outdoor area supports physically active play and adventurous activities. A positive and relaxed tone is evident. Children are cooperative, friendly and settled.</p><p>The friendly culture, well developed communication and support for each other, fosters parents&rsquo; confidence and willingness to become involved in leadership roles and ongoing training. Adults take pride in being part of a learning community alongside their children. Members have a strong sense of belonging and commitment to Playcentre philosophy.</p><p>The association actively promotes bicultural partnership. A M&#257;ori perspective is evident in the centre environment and is developing in the programme. Members continue to support each other to use M&#257;ori language and protocols.</p><p>Parents have worked hard, with the support of the kaitautoko, to develop a curriculum and a process for assessment, planning and evaluation. Ideas are carefully considered and well communicated to build on parents&rsquo; views about their own children's needs and the emerging interests of others. Profile books show aspects of children's participation and learning. Daily discussion and sharing of information support planning decisions. Parents are assisted to recognise learning linked to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and to participate in planning the programme.</p><p>Strong committed leadership and a strategic approach to development effectively support self management and the ongoing sustainability of this service. Parents are highly collaborative and have well-developed communication systems. This collegial approach, with sharing of roles and tasks, supports further training and emergent leadership.</p><p>Self review is valued and strongly promoted by the association. Good frameworks are in place to support practice at centre level. Priorities for development are identified and actioned. Members are reflective and improvement focused. Performance reviews of long-term paid supervisors are undertaken with goals set for their ongoing development.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members&rsquo; practice. A more formalised approach, focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. This centre makes good use of association systems and processes to ensure legislative requirements are met, good practice is sustained and improvement is promoted.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further development is needed to strengthen centre members approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. In particular:</p><ul>
<li>highlighting children's significant learning and adults' responses in profile books illustrating progressions of learning</li>
<li>ensuring that written daily evaluations are learning focused and support individual children's emerging interests and ideas</li>
<li>enhancing children's ownership of their portfolios by making them more accessible, increasing opportunities for children to reflect on their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Members need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. Support to use some association frameworks more effectively, particularly those that build quality improvement should strengthen their approach.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungaraki Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service</p></html>
