</table><p>To strengthen outcomes for children, high quality practices for curriculum provision, internal evaluation and teacher development are needed.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kindy Ltd is a privately owned, purpose built early childhood service. It is situated rurally between Feilding and Palmerston North on 3.6 acres of land. Full day education and care is offered for 50 children over two years of age. Of the 62 children enrolled, four are MƒÅori.</p><p>All four teachers are qualified and three have full certification. The owner/head teacher's certification is subject to confirmation. There are two teachers in training and two fulltime office administrators.</p><p>The March 2014 ERO report identified areas to be given priority for development that included: to seek professional training for all staff to develop a shared understanding of self review; and to strengthen appraisal. Progress has been limited and some processes have lapsed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of supporting children to grow into confident and competent learners. It promotes partnerships with parents, families and the wider community. Teachers should continue to reflect on how well all philosophy values and beliefs are enacted in practice.</p><p>The centre curriculum, environment and resources provide children with an inviting range of activities. Children access the wide open spaces of the adjoining paddocks as part of the daily programme. They enjoy interacting with a variety of animals. Learning opportunities are relevant and promote children‚Äôs problem-solving and experimentation. Children are involved in activities for sustained periods.¬†</p><p>Observations of learning are reflected in profile books and a variety of visual displays within the centre. Narratives and photographs show children's participation and enjoyment. Documentation shows some evidence of teachers‚Äô analysis of observations. At times their understanding of individual children‚Äôs learning pathways support how they plan to add complexity and strengthen outcomes for these children.</p><p>Evaluation of daily whƒÅnau groups is required to ensure programmes are always relevant and responsive to children‚Äôs interests and with a balance of adult-initiated ideas. Integrating increased early childhood approaches into the more structured times should enhance children's learning.</p><p>Staff demonstrate inclusive practices and positively include children with identified learning needs.</p><p>Teachers continue to consider ways to further their understanding about teaching that reflects and responds to MƒÅori learners. Waiata and some basic te reo MƒÅori are heard throughout the daily programme. Teachers should make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako:¬†Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> to further develop culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Professional leadership requires strengthening. The head teacher is not appraised. The appraisal system is not robust. Consideration should be given to developing deliberate strategies for working towards appraisal goals and clear links to relevant professional learning and development. Supporting staff to strengthen their knowledge of high quality practice is a key next step.</p><p>Internal evaluation is not yet developed. Teachers need support to develop increased understanding of formal, in-depth internal evaluation to improve decisionmaking. Strategic planning has lapsed. Management and teachers should collaboratively develop a plan that identifies priorities and associated goals to strengthen centre operations and the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the owner/head teacher agree that the following areas should be further developed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to improve decision making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning to guide teaching and learning and centre operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning to better inform curriculum priorities for teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes for the head teacher and teachers to enhance their professional growth.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kindy Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices and appraisal of all staff. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kindy Ltd will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
