</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Heliers Little School provides full day education and care for up to 30 children between two and five years of age. Most children on the roll are Pākehā. There is also a small number of Māori children and a number of children from Asian, Middle Eastern or European heritage.</p><p>The preschool is part of the Little School group of centres. This organisation provides the centres with a policy and management framework, and a range of support systems dependent on the needs of each service. Daily operation of the preschool is delegated to the head teacher, with leadership roles distributed amongst the other teachers. On line meetings with other head teachers provide a support network for the head teacher.</p><p>The three staff members are registered teachers. They are supported by regular professional development opportunities that reflect their individual goals for development and the needs of the whole preschool. Teachers are committed to ongoing development of bicultural practice in the preschool, and to reflect the cultural and language diversity of the preschool families.</p><p>The preschool philosophy highlights the provision of a learning programme incorporating <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to lay sound foundations for lifelong learning. This underpins teachers' efforts to create a welcoming environment, and build partnerships with parents with a focus on each individual child and their family.</p><p>There have been some staffing changes since the last ERO review. The current team has continued to emphasise the development of sensory motor, reading and mathematical skills. Teachers continue to collect information about children's developmental progress, strengths and interests and share these with parents. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the preschool. They have trusting relationships with teachers and work well alongside their peers. Children settle quickly when arriving and know about choosing resources and working independently. They are engaged in activities that interest them and respond positively to adult support for their play. Children are learning to take turns and to work cooperatively with others. In this focused, calm setting children use early literacy skills in their conversations.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children, modelling the use of equipment, affirming efforts and asking questions to prompt interests. Teachers know children well and often make links with a child’s family or home experiences. They encourage children to take responsibility for their own learning.</p><p>Children and teachers celebrate cultural events throughout the year. Leaders and teachers have strengthened their commitment to raising their own, and children’s, awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Children respond well to basic te reo Māori phrases and sing waiata. Children’s languages and cultures are valued and promoted in this preschool.</p><p>Families value the types of programmes offered and the sense of belonging for children from diverse cultures. They appreciate the experiences that their children enjoy. Parents feel included in their children’s learning through their daily conversations with teachers, displays, topic folders and children's assessment portfolios. These stories, available online, enable families to revisit learning with their children, share them with the wider whānau and make connections with home experiences.</p><p>The head teacher leads a collaborative teaching team with a shared vision for learning. They communicate effectively and use complementary skills well to develop challenging projects to extend children's skills, knowledge and learning dispositions. Teachers are building their capacity to assess children's learning and progress. Teachers recognise that strengthening the links between children's individual learning stories will help them to track progress better.</p><p>The preschool is well managed. The systems in place for preschool operations, ongoing evaluation and support contribute to the efficient management of the service. Teachers are guided by the preschool's teaching and learning philosophy and the strategic goal to promote sustained development. Teachers use the appraisal process well to identify goals, and are encouraged by their leaders to be innovative and reflective in their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that the key next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing specific teaching strategies to challenge children's thinking and deepen the complexity of their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an annual action plan aligned to the strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Heliers Little School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Heliers Little School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
