</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>A Kidz World Homebased Childcare &amp; Education Service (Akl) provides education and care for children from birth to school age in educators' homes. Children are cared for and learn in small family-like groups of up to four children at a time.</p><p>The service operates in Auckland, with other networks operating in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty. It is licensed for 80 children including 40 up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the service operated with 32 educators and a roll of 124 children.</p><p>The three coordinators are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. They regularly visit educators in the home and support them to plan educational programmes for children, underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> The service philosophy emphasises that children learn through play.</p><p>The service provider/owner is a qualified and provisionally registered early childhood teacher. She works collaboratively with the coordinators to support educators and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Service records show that children's sense of belonging and their emotional and physical wellbeing are well supported. The service, coordinators and educators build close relationships with children and their families. Service records indicate that educators are guided to provide inclusive and stimulating environments for children in their care.</p><p>Educators know their children very well and provide a variety of programmes. Infants and toddlers benefit from individualised nurturing and care. Coordinators support educators to provide curriculum experiences that are responsive to children‚Äôs ages, ideas and play interests. They assist educators to organise learning opportunities, day-to-day household activities, and weekly outings and excursions. Children's cultural backgrounds are considered and included in programmes.</p><p>Coordinators are supportive of educators, and they make monthly visits to homes. They develop educators' understanding of the curriculum, and help them to find opportunities for children to learn. Coordinators suggest ideas for wider experiences, resources and equipment to enhance children's learning and extend their interests. Coordinators could monitor how well educators implement these suggestions to embed the changes.</p><p>Coordinators model good teaching practices that include meaningful assessment of children's learning. Coordinators provide examples of children's assessment through monthly individualised learning stories, linking children's learning to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Children's learning is shared with families/whƒÅnau in written portfolios. Some educators demonstrate well developed planning, teaching, and assessment capabilities.</p><p>Coordinators collaborate to support each other in their work and with making decisions. They show a good sense of relational trust, and work together to improve the service. An external facilitator has assisted them with implementing purposeful internal evaluation. Children's wellbeing and education is at the heart of service operations and evaluation.</p><p>The owner and coordinators have a strong commitment to maintaining a high quality home-based education service. Their philosophy and long term goals underpin service practices and policies. Comprehensive documentation outlines clear guidelines and high expectations for coordinators and educators.</p><p>Robust health and safety systems provide assurance that expectations are being well monitored. The owner has implemented careful policies and procedures for educators and coordinators. She has used external expertise to ensure that systems are robust. Educators maintain good records of hygiene practices, and are supported by the coordinators‚Äô regular health and safety checks.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, coordinators and ERO identified key next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build educators' capabilities in curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>developing relevant monitoring systems of educators' curriculum implementation</li>
<li>establishing play group opportunities</li>
<li>further developing parent partnership for children's learning</li>
<li>considering ways to provide a bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>continuing to develop staff professional appraisal and support.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of A Kidz World Homebased Childcare &amp; Education Service (Akl) completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† curriculum</p><p>‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† premises and facilities</p><p>‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† health and safety practices</p><p>‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† governance, management and administration.¬†</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A Kidz World Homebased Childcare &amp; Education Service (Akl) will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 May 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service¬†</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
