</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Hutt Road is situated in Wellington and provides education and care for children from birth to five years. Daily sessions are offered five days a week. The service is licensed for up to 100 children, including up to 28 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this review, three MƒÅori children were enrolled and 16 children identified as Asian.</p><p>The teaching team is composed of qualified teachers assisted by teachers in training and support staff. Since the April 2013 ERO report, a new centre manager has been appointed to manage the day-to-day operation of the service. A collaborative model of leadership is promoted in the centre.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs April 2013 report identified areas requiring further development. These included: developing a shared philosophy for the centre; enhancing the bicultural curriculum; promoting educational success for MƒÅori children; and strengthening self review. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>Early Years Hutt Road operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three in the BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based curriculum. Teachers work alongside them, follow their interests and promote their independence. There is a calm, slow-paced environment, with respectful interactions to support children's learning.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are valued and woven throughout the programme. A next step is for teachers to consider ways they can maximise opportunities to engage and promote learning interactions in these areas with children. A focus on healthy food and physical activity is promoted in learning experiences.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachment. There are comfortable, safe spaces that cater for children who are not yet fully mobile.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is about to be reviewed. As part of this review, leaders and teachers should consider developing indicators of good practice. This should assist teachers to develop shared understandings of expected practice when working with children, and be useful for evaluating how well their practices support the service's priorities for learning.</p><p>The inclusion of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in routine times is evident. Leaders and teachers have identified that integrating these throughout all aspects of the curriculum is a key next step. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to further develop teachers' understanding of educational success for MƒÅori and Pacific children. They are exploring ways they can use <em>TƒÅtaiako, Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> to help improve and support teachers' practice. ERO agrees with this direction. In addition, leaders should consider how they can engage with their Pacific community to develop an understanding of what educational success for these children looks like, in this context.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning profiles have regular and informative entries that highlight their interests, developing friendships, participation in the programme and, at times, learning. Sourcing and reflecting parent aspirations and showing children‚Äôs progression over time are key next steps.</p><p>Group planning currently reflects children‚Äôs interests. A next step is to consider how to establish a consistent approach across all playrooms in the centre. This should support teachers' understanding of the process and parent engagement in the planning cycle.</p><p>Leaders have identified that internal evaluation is an area for ongoing development. They agree that building teachers‚Äô and leaders‚Äô understanding of effective evaluation is a key next step. This should assist them to evaluate the effectiveness of centre practices in relation to outcomes for children.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment that has a developmental focus. Leaders have indicated that a next step is to include formal observations of all teacher practice. Strengthening appraisal to more clearly show teachers' progress towards meeting the goals is also required. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>BestStart as a governing body regularly undertakes parent satisfaction surveys which are used to further develop practice. Parents involved in these surveys indicate a high degree of satisfaction with teacher practice and the curriculum provided.</p><p>Professional service managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. They clearly identify strengths and areas for ongoing development through this process.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A¬†comprehensive policy framework including procedures and systems, guide the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing good practice indicators in relation to the philosophy statements</li>
<li>strengthening the bicultural curriculum and MƒÅori and Pacific educational success</li>
<li>continuing to develop teachers' approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>enhancing the appraisal process</li>
<li>building leaders' and teachers' internal evaluation capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Hutt Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Hutt Road will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on¬†<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
