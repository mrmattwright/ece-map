<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waverley Street Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waverley Street Kindergarten provides education and care for up to 43 children, five mornings per week. Three afternoon sessions are offered for the younger children and wh&#257;nau placements are offered. The teaching team is recently established.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated in the grounds of Richmond School, adjacent to its playing fields. The Enviroschools project has an increasing emphasis in the programme. A family liaison group assists with fundraising and facilitates a range of social occasions for parents. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The child-centred programme is responsive to the strengths and interests of children. It is underpinned by the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki.</em> The guiding vision is evident in practice. Children are encouraged to make their own choices and work collaboratively with others. Their sense of belonging is promoted. Teachers work alongside children in their self-initiated play activities and use rich, descriptive language to support learning.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported and inclusive practice is promoted. Teachers foster children&rsquo;s friendships and engagement in the group to enhance their security and confidence during transition times. Equity funding is used appropriately to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The physical environment offers an appropriate level of challenge and interest and invites children to explore and become fully involved in a wide range of activities. Many opportunities are provided for children that include creative, imaginative and mathematical play and learning. Flexible routines provide a framework for the day. Children have fun and a busy and purposeful atmosphere is evident.</p><p>Teachers are committed to the integrated use of te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori and draw on a range of effective strategies to successfully incorporate these into their practice. Leaders acknowledge whakapapa as integral to the development of a sense of belonging and connectedness. The next step is for teachers to formally consider investigating further what success for M&#257;ori children might look like at Waverley Kindergarten.</p><p>Portfolios are well presented and easily accessible to children and families. These highlight children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and their developing friendships.</p><p>Positive relationships with the local schools support children&rsquo;s transitions. In addition, a range of useful and timely information is made available to parents. Teachers are reflective and engage in ongoing research.</p><p>Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Spontaneous and regular review has been used well to improve outcomes for children. The teachers and association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>The association has recently updated its appraisal procedures to provide clear guidance to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation.</p><p>The Senior Education Adviser (SEA) regularly visits the kindergarten and provides strong support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are supported to enact the association&rsquo;s vision of providing &ldquo;consistently exceptional early childhood education&rdquo;.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>show through the assessment documentation how depth and complexity has been added to children&rsquo;s learning to more effectively highlight progress overtime</li>
<li>strengthen the quality of the interactions by drawing on a wider range of strategies to develop children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning abilities</li>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waverley Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
