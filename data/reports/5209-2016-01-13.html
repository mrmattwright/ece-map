</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greerton Free Kindergarten is located in the city of Tauranga and caters for the culturally diverse community of Greerton. It is licensed for 45 children over the age of two. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior Teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with an emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities, education for sustainability, meeting community need, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching, education and care provided by this kindergarten. There is a strong commitment and support for professional learning and development.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO and has made significant progress in the areas for development identified in the last report about sustainability practices, building children‚Äôs social competencies, and healthy eating initiatives. Since the previous ERO review in 2012 there have been changes to the leadership and teaching team.</p><p>Self review of the kindergarten philosophy has provided a strong foundation for the teaching team to further develop a centre curriculum based on agreed values. A key feature of the philosophy is providing equitable opportunities for all children to learn in a supportive and inclusive environment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau have a strong sense of belonging and ownership and are actively engaged in their children‚Äôs learning. Teachers know the children well and understand their uniqueness within the family context. Teachers have developed authentic relationships with parents and whƒÅnau based on genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect and willingness to listen. This has fostered children‚Äôs strong sense of identity, language and culture within the centre. Parents and whƒÅnau have opportunities to lead the learning in cultural celebrations such as Diwali and Matariki.</p><p>The philosophy was developed collaboratively by the senior leader, head teacher and staff with parent and whƒÅnau input, and is underpinned by shared values and beliefs. These values guide the programme and provide a range of opportunities to build on the cultural funds of knowledge that children and their families bring. Further work is needed to ensure parent aspirations are consistently implemented into the programme.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-resourced environment that enables them to access and construct their own areas of learning and play. This provides a range of opportunities for problem solving, exploration, and children experiencing challenges and risk taking at their own level. Children are encouraged to build their social competencies through discussing and negotiating fairness and social justice with one another and adults. The notion that everyone is a leader and everyone is a learner, is actively promoted through reciprocal learning experiences among children, teachers and families.</p><p>The programme provides a range of rich opportunities for children to follow their interests and engage in sustained play. These include:</p><ul>
<li>meaningful contexts for emergent literacy and mathematics through play</li>
<li>a purposeful understanding of sustainable environmental practices, such as recycling, planting, gardening, composting and water conservation</li>
<li>utilising the local environment to enrich learning such as using facilities within Greerton Village</li>
<li>te reo MƒÅori celebrated in the programme in meaningful and appropriate contexts.</li>
</ul><p>The next step is for teachers to refine their collective understanding of agreed best practice and provide more complex learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Leadership is encouraged and enhanced across all levels, and focuses on improving outcomes for children. The senior teacher is knowledgeable in current theory and research, and provides effective support and guidance for teaching and learning. The head teacher has a strong commitment to the kindergarten philosophy. She works collaboratively with the senior teacher, staff and families to achieve the shared vision and values. Emergent leadership is fostered and encouraged among teachers and allows them to share their interests and strengths to lead professional learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greerton Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Greerton Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
