</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ellerslie Kindergarten offers education and care for a maximum of 40 children over the age of two years. The kindergarten day model offers a six hour day with 40 children during the morning, 30 of whom stay on for the afternoon session. The kindergarten philosophy incorporates a strong focus on children learning through play and encouraging children to make their own choices, experiment and explore alongside their peers.</p><p>The teaching team of four registered teachers is supported by an administrator and an additional staff member to cover lunchtime.</p><p>The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community and many of the children enrolled have MƒÅori, Indian or Asian heritage.</p><p>Teachers have responded positively to previous recommendations from ERO to develop a more robust cycle of self review to increase bicultural practices.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and ongoing support from professional managers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten Kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience strong, supportive relationships with other children and adults. They are very respectful of each other and demonstrate high levels of confidence. There are many opportunities for children to gain knowledge and enhance their self management and communication skills during play. Children are fully engaged in their play. They have free access to a wide variety of learning resources in the indoor and outdoor environments. Children experience some te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within the daily programme.</p><p>Children experience good levels of literacy support through the programme. There are many opportunities for children to read with adults and their peers and to experiment with writing during play. The programme promotes good opportunities for creative and dramatic play along with exploration of the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Parents are welcomed into the kindergarten and are involved in celebrations and special events. Teachers provide parents with useful information about how to support their children when transitioning to school. These strategies promote children‚Äôs effective transitions to school.</p><p>Children participate in events and celebrations that reflect the variety of cultures represented in the community. Children revisit previous learning experiences through visual displays and access to photographs and booklets that they make themselves. Children make good use of the information and communication tools available in the kindergarten and incorporate these within their play.</p><p>Teachers have access to appropriate and supportive professional development. There has been a focus on strengthening bicultural practices and on positive guidance for children. These developments have had a noticeable and positive impact on the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers have linked the kindergarten‚Äôs future direction with the Auckland Kindergarten Association‚Äôs strategic goals. Teachers have created a useful process to undertake spontaneous and planned self review. They are very reflective about the impact of changes they make to the learning environment and the new experiences they offer children and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on current good practice the Association manager and head teacher agree that teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to increase the usefulness of self-review processes by evaluating the impact of interventions on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>further integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori throughout programmes</li>
<li>develop a greater focus on children's learning in planning and assessment records.</li>
</ul><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ellerslie Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Ellerslie Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>31 October 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
