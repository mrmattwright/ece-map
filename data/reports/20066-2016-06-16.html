</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @The Children's House is licensed for up to 50 children and serves the culturally diverse communities surrounding Henderson, West Auckland. It is part of the BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel to support individual centres.</p><p>The centre provides for children in two rooms; Ruma Iti for toddlers, and Ruma Nui for children up to school age. A centre manager and a head teacher provide leadership in the centre and are supported by the BestStart professional services and business managers. Centre staff are long serving. Registered teachers in each room are supported by unqualified staff, and the centre also employs a cook and administrator.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report acknowledged the respect evident in the interactions between teachers and children, and among children. This aspect has been maintained. Teachers have also undertaken self review to strengthen the bicultural and multicultural aspects of the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle well into their daily experiences and they are comfortable in their surroundings. Children are free to choose from Montessori resources or general play activities. Mixed-age play opportunities are encouraged and valued. Children experience uninterrupted play and centre routines are unobtrusive.</p><p>Culturally diverse teachers support children to be strong in their identity and first language. Support for children's first language is evident from teachers. Children show confidence and are encouraged to use their first language, as well as developing their English language skills.</p><p>Teachers skilfully follow children in their play experiences. They take opportunities to support children with focused and relevant conversation to prompt learning. Teachers could now more deliberately foster children's interests. This approach would help to develop children's learning dispositions and would offer greater variety and challenge. More opportunities for children to develop their creative and imaginative play would also enhance the centre's programme. It would be valuable for teachers to evaluate these approaches to notice how they impact on children's engagement and learning.</p><p>Teachers could better reflect the balance of the centre learning approaches of Montessori and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, in the children's individual learning portfolios.</p><p>Teachers have been trying to increase the focus on bicultural practice and understanding of its importance in being a New Zealander. More work and ongoing staff commitment is needed to ensure this worthy project gains the desired traction.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. The review of the centre philosophy has helped to align teachers' thinking with practice. Leaders could develop this philosophy into a more practical tool by collaboratively producing explicit indicators of good practice to guide teaching. These could then be used to better evaluate teacher practices and how they impact on children.</p><p>The centre manager recognises the strengths of her teachers and uses a distributive leadership approach to build teacher capacity and capability. Establishing specific leaders for key curriculum areas could strengthen the centre's developments.</p><p>BestStart management is active in supporting the centre's direction. They are working with staff to develop stronger links between assessment and planning. Leaders and teachers would benefit from appropriate ongoing professional support to build leadership capability. The further development of teachers' reflective practice and inquiry into teaching strategies would help to strengthen the quality of learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders use self review to improve centre practices. They could strengthen self review by developing clear goals, outcomes and timelines to support sustainability. A clear alignment between long-term goals, the performance management systems and the centre programme would provide a more cohesive framework for centre management. The evaluation of these goals should be focused on what impact they have on the children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and BestStart managers agree the priorities for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the focus on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> in the programme to more effectively capture children's interests and enhance their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional development to develop leadership capability and sustainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of the teacher appraisal process so that it offers reflective, collaborative practice opportunities and inquiry into teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori @ The Children's House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ The Children's House will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
