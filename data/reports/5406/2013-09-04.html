</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stoke Kindergarten provides education and care for up to 40 children. It offers both morning and afternoon sessions and an extended day of six hours within an all-day licence. There is flexibility in terms of casual placements. Children come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and programme provision is further enhanced through support staff and volunteers from the community. The kindergarten philosophy, emphasising the importance of building the foundations for future learning in a supportive and fun environment, is strongly evident in practice.</p><p>The Family Liaison group leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing and improvements to the kindergarten environment. They also facilitate a range of social opportunities to foster a sense of community.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergartens and early childhood services reviews in the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Partnership with parents is actively promoted. They have many opportunities to contribute to the kindergarten programme and develop a sense of belonging.</p><p>Children choose to play independently and collaboratively in groups. There are many opportunities for children to read, write and explore early mathematical concepts in the programme. Musical experiences are well integrated and there is sufficient uninterrupted time for children to explore and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. Children engage in sustained play and have fun as part of their learning.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming, responsive and respectful in their interactions with children and parents. They are intentional in the way they recognise and respond to opportunities to engage in and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Feedback to children acknowledges their efforts and success and actively promotes their self-management skills.</p><p>Te reo M&#257;ori and suitable tikanga practices are effectively incorporated in the programme. Teachers use a range of strategies to explore success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori in this context. In addition, they are beginning to consider provision for Pacific children in the kindergarten. Teachers have identified that a next step in this process is to explore the Ministry of Education's Pacific Education Plan. Teachers acknowledge and celebrate the diverse cultural identities and backgrounds of children. Children with additional needs are well supported and monitored. Inclusive practices are promoted.</p><p>Planning is responsive to the individual child&rsquo;s interests, strengths or needs. It is linked to the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Profiles are well presented, highlight children&rsquo;s engagement and developing relationships. Children freely access their profiles and use them to revisit their prior learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers have made recent changes to the kindergarten&rsquo;s transition-to-school programme. Parents and children have responded positively to these changes. Teachers are currently involved in a review but are yet to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten, and the resulting review. Spontaneous review has been used to reflect on aspects of the programme and inform ongoing improvements. Teachers and the association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear guiding documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The recently updated appraisal process is collaborative and provides clear guidance and support to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation. ERO&rsquo;s evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are well supported to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be more consistent in the approach used to document assessment. This information should show how depth and complexity has been added to children&rsquo;s learning to more effectively highlight progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stoke Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stoke Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>4 September 2013<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/ERO-s-Approach-to-Reviews-in-Early-Childhood-Services-DRAFT-2012"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
