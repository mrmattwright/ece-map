<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 3 is one of four centres that operate within the community complex. It caters for children aged from 18 months to three years old. It is an important part of community life.</p><p align="left">The centre reflects its philosophy, which is based on Christian principles and values. The role of the family is central to the centre and provides the basis for a unified approach to the care of children and to life within this unique community.</p><p align="left">Positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>family and community contributions that enhance the learning programme and children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>teachers working with children in calm and unhurried ways that promote children&rsquo;s sense of security and opportunities for learning</li>
<li>children benefiting from warm, respectful relationships with teachers and other children</li>
<li>teachers modelling care and respect for one another and encouraging children to care for others and the environment</li>
<li>children actively involved in a learning programme that has a strong focus on literacy, numeracy and music.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The supervisor has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve outcomes for children relate to strengthening the planning, evaluation, self review and appraisal processes.</p><p align="left">Gloriavale early childhood centres are at the early stages of sharing examples of good management and teaching practices. ERO agrees that this process needs to be extended so that existing good practice can be shared across all four centres.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 3 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 3.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy is based on Christian principles and values. It recognises the importance of adults and children being polite, honest, respectful and having good manners. It aims to promote literacy and numeracy, inquiry, exploration of the natural world and the care of animals. Children are encouraged to develop their interests in music, arts and crafts. Tidiness, cleanliness and perseverance are valued attributes. The role of the family is central to the centre, and provides the basis for a unified approach to life within this unique community.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Relationships</h5><p align="left">Teachers establish warm, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children and parents. The centre and community share strong values and a vision that promote children&rsquo;s well-being and sense of belonging. Children benefit from the teachers&rsquo; caring and nurturing interactions. They are confident to approach adults, share ideas and ask for help, trusting that their needs will be met. Children generally play cooperatively and enjoy positive relationships with other children and adults.</p><p align="left">Parent and community contributions are valued. Teachers and parents share information that supports children&rsquo;s well-being and learning at home and at the centre.</p><h5>Teamwork</h5><p align="left">Teachers have developed an effective team approach. This results in consistent teaching practices and better learning outcomes for children. The teaching philosophy is based on shared understandings of the values, vision and expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and behaviour.</p><p align="left">Teachers model care and respect for one another. They communicate effectively and work well together to provide children with a good sense of security and opportunities for learning.</p><p align="left">A well-planned approach to professional development, at an individual and team level has a positive impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h5>Children as learners</h5><p align="left">Teachers view children as capable learners. Children actively participate in a wide range of formal and free play learning experiences. They respond well to familiar and predictable routines.</p><p align="left">Children are confident to make their own choices from a good range of learning resources and activities. Children&rsquo;s social skills are encouraged and affirmed by caring and responsive teachers. Children play cooperatively with and alongside others for sustained periods of time. Teachers encourage children to support and care for others and the environment.</p><h5>Teaching interactions</h5><p align="left">Teachers work with and alongside children in calm, respectful and unhurried ways. They provide flexible and positive responses to children&rsquo;s individual and group preferences and needs. Teachers are actively involved in children&rsquo;s play using a good range of teaching strategies to encourage children&rsquo;s participation in learning. Teachers reinforce and extend children&rsquo;s developing communication skills. They foster children&rsquo;s social skills by providing clear expectations and consistent guidance.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a focused and consistent approach to literacy and numeracy learning. Children receive formal instruction, for a short period of time each day. The literacy programme is linked to the preschool programme and is differentiated for each learning level.</p><h5>Learning environment</h5><p align="left">The learning environment strongly supports the programme. Teachers have made changes to the layout of the inside environment. It now provides specific learning areas for children under two years and children over two years of age. Literacy, numeracy and music are a focus of the learning programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers make purposeful links to the community and families who are a valued resource to enhance the learning programme.</p><p align="left">The recent developments in the outside area provide an increased range of learning experiences in a spacious natural environment.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Programming planning and evaluation</h5><p align="left">The supervisors have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>make better use of assessment information to inform programme planning</li>
<li>build on planning and evaluation processes to clearly identify teaching strategies and learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h5>Strategic planning and self review</h5><p align="left">The supervisors have identified, and ERO agree, that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>extend strategic planning to cover all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operations</li>
<li>identify long-term and short-term priorities within strategic planning</li>
<li>strengthen self review in the areas of learning and teaching.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Supervisors and ERO also agree that supervisors should continue to review and develop staff appraisal processes.</p><p align="left">The Gloriavale centres are at the early stages of sharing examples of good management and teaching practices across all four centres. ERO agrees that this process needs to be extended further so that existing good practice can be shared across all four centres.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy is based on the principles of the New Testament and teachings from the Bible. Value is placed on the central place of families and children being cared for together. These aspects align to M&#257;ori values and are strongly evident in the programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers know all children and families well.

Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 3 completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist.

<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

It caters for children aged from 18 months to three years old. It is an important part of community life.</p><p align="left">The centre reflects its philosophy, which is based on Christian principles and values. The role of the family is central to the centre and provides the basis for a unified approach to the care of children and to life within this unique community.</p><p align="left">Positive features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>family and community contributions that enhance the learning programme and children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>teachers working with children in calm and unhurried ways that promote children&rsquo;s sense of security and opportunities for learning</li>
<li>children benefiting from warm, respectful relationships with teachers and other children</li>
<li>teachers modelling care and respect for one another and encouraging children to care for others and the environment</li>
<li>children actively involved in a learning programme that has a strong focus on literacy, numeracy and music.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The supervisor has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve outcomes for children relate to strengthening the planning, evaluation, self review and appraisal processes.</p><p align="left">Gloriavale early childhood centres are at the early stages of sharing examples of good management and teaching practices. ERO agrees that this process needs to be extended so that existing good practice can be shared across all four centres.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
