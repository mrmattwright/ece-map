</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids at Play Childcare Centre is located in the inner city suburb of Mt Eden, Auckland. The service has served its community since 1987, and operates as a not for profit incorporated society. The management committee, made up from elected parents and the centre manager, is the governing body for the centre.</p><p>The committee appoints a centre manager who has responsibility for professional leadership and for the daily operations of the service. The centre provides education and care for 42 children up to the age of five years, including 12 under the age of two. Children are organised into two specific groups and areas, those under two years and those over two years old.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. The 2012 report recommended the centre focus on extending children‚Äôs learning through a review of the environment and the opportunities it offered children. A further suggestion for teaching staff was to engage cognitively with children to lift the level of complexity in their play. Progress has been made in these areas and they continue to be a focus for centre development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Families and children are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children settle quickly, demonstrate a sense of belonging and engage confidently with adults and each other. Teachers respond sensitively to children‚Äôs care routines and specific ongoing needs and preferences.</p><p>Staff offer a programme based on emerging topic activities, developed from teachers‚Äô observations of children at play. There are often three or four different emerging topics to engage children simultaneously in the centre‚Äôs learning environment. This provides a variety of choice and some degree of challenge. Teachers now need to extend and strengthen children‚Äôs individual learning in these contexts in line with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Assessment portfolios show that teachers write informative learning stories centred on children‚Äôs learning experiences and on their progress over time. The children‚Äôs portfolios are of good quality in this respect. Teachers‚Äô planning would benefit from better use of the portfolio information about children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities, to feed into the learning programme.</p><p>Older children are regularly grouped together, particularly in the afternoons, to follow a transition to school programme. Centre leaders could consider professional development for staff to explore the most effective and current practice for supporting the learning of this age group.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs review in 2012 the centre has focused professional development on the understanding of schema. This knowledge has enabled teachers to deepen children's learning experiences. The centre manager and teachers are accessing other current and relevant sources of professional learning to ensure a high quality curriculum and programme are provided for children.</p><p>Some spontaneous self review has been effectively conducted by the centre manager and teachers to improve centre policies and procedures. There now needs to be a focus on developing strategic planning and the use of self review to bring about continuous improvement to learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO endorses the centre leaders‚Äô self-identified next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>think and plan strategically to work meaningfully towards the centre‚Äôs vision and philosophy</li>
<li>strengthen learning partnerships with parents that focus on children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities and feed this information into the planned programme</li>
<li>continue to focus on the development of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori in the centre‚Äôs programme to support children‚Äôs understanding of New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also recommends that centre leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>make links between assessment and planning to better support individual children‚Äôs learning and interests and to reflect current best practice in early years education</li>
<li>continue to develop self review that promotes better learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids at Play Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids at Play Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
