</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kid's Cove Education &amp; Childcare is a well established early learning service in a quiet residential street in Avondale. It is one of three Kid's Cove centres owned by the same family group. The centre operates in a renovated bungalow and is licenced to cater for 33 children, including eight up to two years of age. The centre serves a culturally diverse community and has relatively even numbers of MƒÅori, Pacific, PƒÅkehƒÅ and African children. There are also smaller numbers of Indian and Chinese children.</p><p>The centre is organised into two, age-related learning spaces. Infants and toddlers up to two years of age have their own indoor and outdoor spaces but have significant opportunities to mix with the older children. The centre's philosophy espouses a deep respect for children. Its aims are to nurture children in partnership with whƒÅnau in a warm, homely environment where teachers follow children's interests and dispositions.</p><p>One of the owners, the service director, is actively involved in the centre and shares her time across all three Kid's Cove services. The manager has worked at the centre for many years. She is responsible for the daily running of the centre and is supported by an experienced, long-serving teaching team. An external early childhood consultant provides governance and management guidance, and support for teachers to enhance their teaching practices.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified areas of good practice that included a welcoming and supportive environment for children and families. The next steps identified included improving planning, assessment and evaluation, evaluating the formal mathematics and transition-to-school programmes, and improving teacher appraisal processes. These areas have been addressed well.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families experience a welcoming and inclusive environment. Children settle well at the start of their day. They are trusting with their teachers and comfortable in the centre environment. Older children have many opportunities to visit and play with babies and toddlers. They are very caring towards each other and their younger friends.</p><p>Teachers work together to plan good quality learning programmes based on children's identified interests and learning needs. They work alongside children, guiding and supporting their learning effectively. Teachers are increasingly skilled in noticing, recognising and responding to children's emerging interests, and they build on children's earlier learning well. Literacy and numeracy are very well integrated into other learning areas and within the context of children's play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience gentle, nurturing approaches from knowledgeable and capable teachers. They cater well to the care and learning needs of these youngest children. Regular communication with parents ensures that teachers follow home routines and respond to parent preferences. Teachers follow and respond well to children's dispositions and ideas about the world. They also respond well to the aspirations that parents have for their children and are sensitive to families' needs. Transitions to school are very well managed by teachers.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and positive with children. They promote an unhurried pace to the learning day, and manage routines so that children's needs are well met. Teachers' focus on children's interests includes providing them with very good access to learning materials that include open-ended resources. Children's portfolios highlight the progress children make in their learning over time. They also make clear the teacher's role in planning for and extending children's learning.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value children's cultures and languages in many ways throughout the centre. They are increasingly skilled in their use of te reo MƒÅori and inclusion of some aspects of tikanga MƒÅori. Teachers' intentions to further strengthen the centre's bicultural curriculum show their commitment to promoting the cultural identity of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre is well led and governed. The centre manager is collaborative and improvement focused. Teachers value professional learning opportunities, including the use of research, to improve their practice. The centre's philosophy is evident in practice. It is well aligned to the centre's strategic planning and internal evaluation, and teachers' professional learning and appraisal processes. Internal evaluation is very well understood and used as a tool for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre include centre managers:</p><ul>
<li>further promoting teachers' skills in extending children's learning</li>
<li>continuing to improve the outdoor environments, especially for older children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kid's Cove Education &amp; Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kid's Cove Education &amp; Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
