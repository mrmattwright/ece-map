</table><p>Funhouse Learning Centre has recently experienced significant change and high staff turnover. The newly-appointed centre manager and team leaders are systematically improving systems and processes to promote the sustained quality of its provision for children. These developments are at an early stage of implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Funhouse Learning Centre is one of two privately-owned early childhood education and care facilities. It is licensed to cater for up to 30 children aged over two years. The other Funhouse service, which is adjacent, is for children under two years.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs directors oversee financial and property-related aspects of its operations. Management of the day-to-day education and care is the responsibility of the centre manager and a team leader. Their priority goal is to support a positive learning environment for children through collaborative, respectful relationships between teachers, parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The philosophy is underpinned by the founder‚Äôs mission to provide ‚Äòyour child‚Äôs home away from home‚Äô.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in an environment that is well resourced and thoughtfully laid out. They freely access a wide range of age-appropriate equipment and materials for exploration, challenge, construction, creativity and dramatic play.</p><p>Children‚Äôs relationships with each other and with teachers are warm and trusting, with a strong sense of family. Teachers show a caring approach toward all children. They are familiar with and respond to individual needs and strengths.</p><p>Teachers are reviewing the ways they assess children‚Äôs learning, plan suitable programmes and reflect on their effectiveness in fostering learning and wellbeing. Improvement in these processes is well supported by close collegiality among staff and clearly articulated guidelines and expectations. To better reflect the centre philosophy, leaders recognise that strengthening and fostering child-led learning is a priority. To bring this about, making close, explicit links between assessment, planning and evaluation is the next step.</p><p>The centre manager and team leader are developing a robust framework to support continuous improvement in teaching and learning. These include observing practice, giving feedback and documenting evidence of effective teaching in terms of its impact on children‚Äôs learning and engagement. New appraisal processes are to be implemented in 2016. These are seen as a key element in promoting consistent quality and enhancing future development.</p><p>Provisionally registered teachers receive appropriate mentoring from externally-based early childhood practitioners.</p><p>Changes in leadership provide a sound platform from which to develop the organisational conditions for ongoing improvement. Emerging leaders are well supported to build their capability. For the sustained growth of the centre, it is timely to review leadership roles and responsibilities, particularly in relation to administration.</p><p>Leaders are highly reflective. Using appropriate evidence, they conduct formal reviews of programmes and operations to improve outcomes for children. It is timely to shift review practice from looking at what they do to evaluating how well teaching and learning practices support improved outcomes. As a starting point staff should develop and document what success and effectiveness look like. This will contribute to a set of clear criteria against which staff can measure the centre‚Äôs performance.</p><p>Daily routines and programmes reflect the centre‚Äôs bicultural and multicultural community. Children hear te reo MƒÅori spoken by staff, and recognise and use MƒÅori words and phrases. Further building teachers‚Äô cultural awareness, knowledge and responsiveness is identified as an important next step in the ongoing integration of tikanga MƒÅori in teaching and learning.</p><p>Formal and informal feedback from parents and whƒÅnau affirms the friendly, comfortable way in which they are welcomed and included in daily programmes. Their aspirations, ideas and wishes are sought and responded to. Leaders continue to explore ways to increase parent and whƒÅnau engagement in the life of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To ensure the centre‚Äôs further growth and development, the centre manager and team leaders recognise that they must continue to implement and embed the new systems and processes. ERO‚Äôs evaluation supports this view.</p><p>Key next steps for leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>reinforce the alignment between assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>sharpen internal evaluation practice</li>
<li>increase the focus on children‚Äôs ownership and direction of their learning</li>
<li>ensure that staff are formally appraised</li>
<li>review leadership roles, structures and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Funhouse Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement a system of regular appraisal.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Funhouse Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
