</table><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A new centre that caters for children aged two to five, Sancta Maria Montessori Preschool is privately owned and has had ongoing roll growth since opening in 2013. Although the centre is licenced for 38 children, the owner and manager try to keep the roll number below this in order to promote best quality learning programmes and experiences for children. Parents travel some distance to bring their children to the centre where they attend from 8.00am until 3.30pm.</p><p>The purpose-built facilities reflect and reinforce the centre‚Äôs philosophy related to its Montessori, <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em> and Catholic foundations. Each child is allocated a key teacher when they start at the centre. Children learn together in groups and also have regular times for self-initiated play and exploration.</p><p>Cultural diversity is a significant feature of the centre‚Äôs children, teachers and families. A number of children speak two or three languages and have many opportunities to celebrate their cultures with their parents.</p><p>The centre is actively involved with a local education cluster that is focused on improving outcomes for children. This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are prioritised and promoted across the centre. The vibrant learning environment, Montessori programmes and centre practices combine to provide learning opportunities that aim to meet children‚Äôs intellectual, physical, social and spiritual needs. These aspects contribute to children being well involved in their learning in ways that promote self management and independence.</p><p>Children benefit from the centre‚Äôs rich cultural diversity and the inclusive and positive relationships staff have with parents and whƒÅnau. Creative and interesting opportunities are provided throughout the year for parents to share their cultures with children. Teachers actively encourage children to respect themselves and each other and to take care of centre resources and facilities.</p><p>Learning programmes reflect the centre‚Äôs philosophy and belief that every child can learn and succeed. The structured and well-supported learning programme is designed to meet each stage of children‚Äôs development and progress. Teachers invite children to move to the next stage of learning when they are ready. Children also have ongoing opportunities, either collaboratively or individually, to initiate and creatively explore areas of interest to them.</p><p>Deliberate changes to summer and winter programmes allow children to take advantage of learning experiences and opportunities that come with each season. Children‚Äôs learning progress is well monitored in line with the Montessori programme of assessment. Child profile and group books are used to capture the wide range of learning experiences children have at the centre.</p><p>Centre leadership is a significant strength. Leaders are very responsive to the needs of children and their parents. Comprehensive support is in place for any child who has specific learning or other needs. Centre leaders are reflective and have a good understanding of their next steps for improvement. They ensure that centre systems and practices focus on benefiting children‚Äôs learning, wellbeing and safety. Centre leaders also make sure that children have sustained opportunities to be extended in their thinking and understanding of the world around them.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning identify relevant priorities for children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Centre leaders recognise that increased alignment between this planning and centre systems and practices is an important next step. Appraisal processes for staff meet expectations. Increasing teacher reflection and inquiry into children‚Äôs learning will strengthen outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that it is now timely to further improve some aspects of centre operations. These include:</p><ul>
<li>building leadership capacity and collaboration across the centre</li>
<li>ensuring that learning progress, next steps for learning and parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs voices are more visible in profile books.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also recommends that centre leaders continue to improve their self-review practices. Useful aspects to focus on include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the depth of self review by evaluating the impact of programmes and practices on children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing</li>
<li>evaluating the impact that practices such as appraisal and professional learning programmes are having on teachers‚Äô expertise, knowledge and skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sancta Maria Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>18 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
