</table><p>Ragamuffins 2 Childcare and Preschool Education Centre (Ragamuffins) requires further development in management and leadership so that improvements are made and sustained.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ragamuffins caters for up to 27 children between two and five years of age. The centre, in Onehunga, Auckland, operates from a converted house with a large outdoor area.</p><p>The centre is managed by the owner, with the programme overseen by a team leader. The 2011 ERO report recommended that improvements be made in the curriculum, self review and partnership with families. In 2012 some progress was made in addressing these matters. However, in 2013 the relationship between management and leadership became strained, limiting further progress and the continuation of earlier initiatives.</p><p>The week prior to this ERO review there was a change of leadership, with a new team leader appointed to the role.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This ERO review identifies some significant areas for improvement in the areas of management and leadership, but acknowledges that the quality of care children receive has not been compromised. Improvements in the service should now focus on ensuring that staff are better supported to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The environment is attractive and appealing. The clutter in the play rooms has been cleared, and equipment better organised. The inside of the building has been repainted and the outdoor classroom has been extended. Children enjoy playing together and are inclusive of each other. They have very good self-management skills, and are developing sound literacy knowledge.</p><p>This ERO review notes that staff are recognising and responding to children‚Äôs interests more effectively than in 2011. While there is still improvement needed, these actions are helping the programme to be more meaningful and relevant for children.</p><p>The programme continues to be quite routine-driven. Teachers and children spend significant periods of time packing away activities and tidying so that all children can eat together. Children‚Äôs learning opportunities would be enhanced, and teachers more able to support children‚Äôs learning, if the number of interruptions during the day was reduced.</p><p>Planning and assessment practices are not up to standard. Staff need external support to help develop useful, current programme planning methods. They also need to be more accountable for their use of the generous non-contact time provided by management. Some assessment records are of good quality and could be used as models to help build practice. Good professional leadership is needed so that staff are guided to achieve curriculum expectations.</p><p>The centre manager wants to further strengthen the partnership with parents and have an external facilitator help gauge the level of responsiveness to MƒÅori and Pacific cultures in the programme. These are very useful areas to work on, and some good foundational practices are already in place.</p><p>The centre has appropriate systems for managing administrative requirements and health and safety in the environment. However, for an extended period of time there has been limited monitoring to ensure systems have been implemented as required. This has led to some gaps in record keeping and in practice. Better quality assurance is needed to ensure that requirements are being met.</p><p>Self review has not been documented since 2012. Centres are required to have a process for self review to help show how the service meets requirements, and to help determine where improvements are needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner/manager is aware that many practices need to be re-established or improved. ERO, the centre manager and team leader agree that the priorities for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>build a positive team culture where all staff and managers have shared understandings about how to promote positive learning outcomes for all children</li>
<li>clarify the roles and lines of responsibility of the centre manager and team leader, and improve communication between management, leadership and staff</li>
<li>provide effective leadership to induct new staff and to further improve the quality of the programme</li>
<li>develop systems for quality assurance</li>
<li>organise policies so that staff and parents have access to a complete and current set of policies and procedures</li>
<li>develop effective management planning so that annual and strategic goals are progressed and new initiatives sustained</li>
<li>undertake effective, ongoing and documented self review.</li>
</ul><p>Professional learning and development for the staff and managers will be necessary to help the service make the required changes.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ragamuffins 2 Childcare &amp; Preschool Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance during the review. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>an ongoing process of self review is in place to help the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care</li>
<li>where a teacher is dismissed for any reason, the mandatory report is sent to the Teachers Council</li>
<li>all provisionally registered teachers have access to an appropriate induction and mentoring programme and are formally evaluated and provided with appropriate feedback</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6; Education Act 1989; Education Act 1989, s125.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ragamuffins 2 Childcare &amp; Preschool Education Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="[sitetree_link,id=]">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
