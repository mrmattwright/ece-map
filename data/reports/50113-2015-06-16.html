</table><p>With targeted external assistance and support, Little Monkeys Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Monkeys Learning Centre is one of two private early childhood services under common ownership. It is licensed for 30 children, including 12 aged up to two years. Infants and toddlers are catered for in a separate learning area adjacent to the main building. The owner and head teacher work collaboratively to lead and manage the two centres. The owner has a strong commitment to removing financial barriers to children‚Äôs participation in the service.</p><p>Four of the seven teachers are new to the centre since the July 2013 ERO review. The majority have been employed in the last 12 months.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review found significant development was needed particularly in relation to building leadership capacity and sustainable systems to improve teaching practice and learning for children. Key next steps were identified which included: building teachers‚Äô understanding of effective early childhood teaching; developing a robust appraisal process to improve learning and teaching; and increasing knowledge and use of self review and evaluation.</p><p>Since that time, the teaching team has received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO).</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of acknowledging the uniqueness of each child, fostering parents‚Äô and whƒÅnau participation and supporting children to lead their own learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Some improvement is evident for most of the concerns identified in the previous ERO report. Further progress is still necessary to improve the quality of teaching and learning, systems and processes that support improvement and ensuring that all legal accountabilities are regularly monitored and met.</p><p>The quality of teaching has improved. ERO's observations of the programme in action indicate that children:</p><ul>
<li>display a strong sense of belonging at the centre</li>
<li>are confident, independent learners</li>
<li>engage well with teachers who use learning conversations and respect their choices and ideas</li>
<li>participate in a curriculum that is largely child led</li>
<li>have access to a range of experiences in the learning environment.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should identify, through self review, how well the curriculum and resource provision provides children with opportunities for self expression and problem solving.</p><p>Good progress has been made in improving planning for learning. A more individualised approach is developing which includes ongoing evaluation of each child‚Äôs learning. Well-presented journals record emerging interests and progress.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are contented and self-motivated learners. They have choices in their play and participation. Their interests are carefully noted to support planning for their learning. Ongoing access to professional development for staff, focused on quality provision for these small learners, should further strengthen the environment, resources and staff practices.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported. Centre leaders are proactive in accessing external assistance for these learners to support their participation in the centre curriculum.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre, and on to school, are well supported. Teachers have a flexible approach which takes families‚Äô needs into account. They continue to build relationships with local schools.</p><p>Leaders give priority to the importance of building relationships with parents and whƒÅnau to support their children‚Äôs early learning and centre decision making. An online tool is being used. Teachers continue to explore ways to increase parent contributions to their child's programme.</p><p>Commitment to integrating bicultural practices is evident. Next development steps are agreed as seeking support from the local MƒÅori community and using Ministry of Education publications to enrich the approach to working with MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. A revised appraisal process is in place to support their reflection on professional teaching requirements. This includes goal setting. Peer feedback is a planned addition. Leaders have identified that this process now needs to be embedded into practice and reviews as planned to identify its effectiveness for improving teachers' performance.</p><p>The advice and guidance programme for provisionally registered teachers requires improvement. Centre leaders should regularly monitor the quality of this process.</p><p>The head teacher's leadership practice is developing as a result of support she has received from the SELO programme and additional professional development. Implementing systems that build sustainable practice and promote improvement and accountability remain areas for further action, including:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to review written guidelines for staff to clarify meanings and promote shared understandings of expectations, such as guidelines to support curriculum and management practices</li>
<li>implementing the revised policy review cycle to support the timely revision of guiding documents</li>
<li>improving annual planning to clearly outline tasks, persons responsible and anticipated timelines</li>
<li>strengthening accountability processes</li>
<li>all staff to continue to develop their self review and evaluation capacity for the continuous improvement of centre practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders should focus on strengthening systems that promote and sustain good practice. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>the collaborative review and further definition of the philosophy and strategic priorities</li>
<li>support to develop teachers‚Äô shared understanding and use of evaluative review</li>
<li>the implementation of the revised teacher appraisal process</li>
<li>the development of an advice and guidance programme for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>further development of written guidelines, particularly to support curriculum and management practices</li>
<li>focused support for the head teacher‚Äôs leadership, including appraisal and ongoing mentoring</li>
<li>clear definition of leadership responsibilities for the senior roles recently created in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there should be continued focus on:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of the learning environment, especially for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>increasing the range of creative and investigative learning opportunities, especially for older children</li>
<li>the development of a more bicultural curriculum and ways to best support MƒÅori learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders seek external assistance to develop an action plan for ERO that outlines how they will systematically address the key next steps identified in this report.</p><p>Progress against the action plan will be monitored by ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Monkeys Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non compliance:</p><p>The service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>that furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury is secured</li>
<li>the head teacher is appraised</li>
<li>all staff who are not registered teachers are police vetted prior to their employment being confirmed and having unsupervised access to children¬†<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS56, GMA7, Education Act 1989</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the service provider should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>agreements to support the safe and suitable use of information and communication technologies in the centre are put in place</li>
<li>records of Ministry of Education bulk funding, received and spent, are displayed in the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Little Monkeys Learning Centre will be dependent on the quality of the action plan provided to ERO.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
