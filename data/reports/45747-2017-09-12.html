</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Shoots Childrens Centre (Papamoa) is a purpose-built centre located in Papamoa. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education for 100 children, including up to 35 aged under two. The service comprises two separate buildings divided into five age-specific learning spaces. The current roll of 134 includes four children who identify as Māori.</p><p>The teaching team consists of experienced early childhood educators, new graduates, students and newly registered teachers. Since the previous ERO review staffing has remained relatively consistent. At the time of this review several staff were on short-term leave.</p><p>Integrity and respect underpin teaching and care for all whānau at the centre. Staff value the importance of relationships and build on respectful interactions between tamariki and kaiako. The spacious learning environment has a focus on natural resources and environmental sustainability that reflects the philosophy of the centre.</p><p>Since the last review a new co-owner/general manager has joined the team, a new centre director has been promoted from within the teaching team and a distributive leadership model has been established. Management has strengthened the areas for development identified in the 2013 ERO report related to increasing the Māori dimension, sharing good practice and strategic planning.</p><p>The centre is privately owned by three educators who are qualified in early childhood education and also own and govern centres in Tauranga, Auckland and Hamilton.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong reciprocal relationships are evident with children and whānau. Teachers respond to children with in-depth conversations and questioning to extend their learning and thinking. Children are empowered to take increased responsibility for their learning, well-being of themselves, others and the group. They are actively engaged in meaningful and sustained learning through purposeful play.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are nurtured by teachers in a calm and responsive environment. Caring and respectful relationships between families and teachers support babies natural rhythms and routines. Children’s language development is fostered by key whānau support teachers. Teachers provide children with the time and space to explore, discover, and be challenged in a learning environment that is suitable for these young children. In addition, effective transition processes are well planned and support children's sense of confidence.</p><p>The service's curriculum effectively promotes positive learning outcomes for children. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into all areas of the curriculum. Problem solving and exploration is promoted through the large, free flowing, and natural learning environments. Teachers are developing effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes that reflect and respond to children's interests and learning. At the time of this review leaders were evaluating processes to promote increased parent contributions in assessment practice.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are naturally included in the daily programme. Language, culture and identity is acknowledged by deliberate acts of teaching. Professional learning and development have supported teachers to have an understanding of te ao Māori across the curriculum. The authentic and respectful use of te reo, waiata and tikanga in everyday practice nurtures the wairua and mana of Māori tamariki. Children are developing confidence and competence within a bicultural context. In addition, strong foundations with whānau and children are contributing to a sense of well-being and belonging for all.</p><p>The professional leader is effectively building teacher capability through coaching and mentoring. Distributed leadership is promoted throughout the centre and there is a high level of relational trust between centre management, leaders and staff. Collaborative ways of working are fostered with teachers sharing their strengths and knowledge. Children benefit from leadership that strongly advocates for infants, toddlers, young children and their whānau.</p><p>The owners are providing effective governance. The service's philosophy, vision, goals and systems effectively promotes positive learning experiences for all children. Policies, procedures are well established. Management have strengthened the area of strategic planning and developed an annual plan alongside the teaching team. Self-review is valued, effectively undertaken and leads to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next step is to further develop the appraisal process to support teachers to gather ongoing evidence in relation to education council requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Shoots Childrens Centre (Papamoa) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of New Shoots Childrens Centre (Papamoa) will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>12 September 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
