</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Skiwiland Creche is in a unique alpine setting where infants, toddlers and children up to school age attend the centre on a casual or regular basis over the ski season. At the time of this ERO review, the centre had recently begun operating on a new licence extending the centre's capacity to provide care for infants and toddlers under two-years of age. It has also incorporated the ski school into the centre for children over three who choose to have ski lessons.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, considerable work has been completed to upgrade the facilities, providing children and their families with a warm, welcoming centre. Children are provided with a safe place to explore both the unfamiliar alpine setting and a more familiar centre environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are enthusiastic and actively promote good quality education and care for children, their learning and wellbeing within a ski resort setting. They are nurturing towards children and provide a calm, relaxed environment for them and their families.</p><p>Teachers respond quickly and directly to children, adapting their responses to meet individual needs and interests. They listen carefully to children, asking questions to encourage their learning and thinking. Teachers provide carefully focused attention and encouragement appropriately. Children are given scope to explore and create play.</p><p>Teachers value children‚Äôs ability to make decisions and support them. Children find the programme fun and interesting.</p><p>Teachers work with ski instructors to successfully transition children between the centre and the ski school.</p><p>Teachers skilfully use daily care routines as opportunities to have meaningful interactions with children. They make good connections between the child‚Äôs world outside the centre environment and the programme. Teachers quickly help children feel comfortable and connected in their new surroundings. Children settle well and enjoy their learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported. They easily develop warm relationships with their teachers. Teachers are responsive, constantly interacting with children and talking to them about their play. Teachers gather useful information from parents about children‚Äôs routines and characteristics. They effectively use this information to guide the programme.</p><p>Children enjoy a varied environment that is attractively set out to engage their curiosity and desire to explore. It is well resourced, provides many alpine experiences and reflects New Zealand's unique bicultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers skilfully work as a team. They regularly discuss and share ideas about changes to the programme to meet children‚Äôs needs throughout the day. They ably model and guide children by noticing and responding promptly to their interests.</p><p>Professional development has helped teachers to gain a greater understanding of self review and how it can be used to support ongoing improvement. They have developed an effective approach that has led to the trialling of a new planning and assessment model.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers are keen to continuously improve the quality of education and care they provide. To move closer toward achieving this goal consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>developing strategic plans so they more strongly reflect outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthening the partnership between Skiwiland Creche and ski school</li>
<li>reviewing the supervision plan to ensure all children can be easily supervised at all times</li>
<li>ensuring a process for assessing the learning and development of children who attend regularly is in place</li>
<li>continuing to build on programme plans to show children‚Äôs learning and how this can be further extended for those who attend regularly.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Skiwiland Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Skiwiland Creche will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>
