</table><p>Requires further development</p><p>Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia requires further development because ERO have concerns the governance and management are not compliant in relation to the performance management system, centre resourcing and appropriate outdoor learning spaces.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Waipuna Ariki o Matatangireia is situated in the rohe of Ngāti Awa near Whakatane. It is an early childhood education and care centre and the initiative of Te Tohu o Te Ora o Ngāti Awa Trust. The trust provides social health and education for the community. Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia is a bilingual service that values Ngāti Awatanga.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 60 children with 25 children under the age of two. It is a full day education and care centre. At the time of this review, 66 children were enrolled including 45 children of Māori descent.</p><p>The chief executive officer (CEO) has overall responsibility for all functions of the trust and directly reports to the board of trustees. The newly appointed centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day centre operations. The trust provides transportation so that whānau and their children can attend the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy provides an emergent and structured curriculum ensuring tamariki are prepared for their world and have a love for life-long learning. Teachers support children to be persistent and resilient in their lives and to show awhi, manaaki and aroha to all.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014, there have been significant staff changes including a new centre manager and CEO. The centre has four age-related learning spaces that are led by knowledgeable teachers. There is a recently appointed leader of learning who supports curriculum review and design across the centre.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014, the centre has not made sufficient progress in the areas identified for improvement. These include strategic planning, performance management, budget allocations, and the provision of educational learning resources and environments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are learning through the principles of Pou Mataaho and are guided by kaiako as rangatira mo āpopo, leaders of tomorrow. Teachers know children well, and are intentional in the way they engage tamariki, developing their cultural identity and sense of self. Whakawhanaungatanga is promoted and seen as a strength of teaching and learning. Children are supported to change roles between teacher and learner, promoting ako.</p><p>Teachers are competent and confident in te reo and tikanga Māori. Opportunities are promoted to scaffold children's ability to kōrero Māori. The curriculum follows children's interests and is focussed on te ao Māori. Dramatic play, art and music foster imagination and creativity and are explored through whakaari and pūrakau. Teachers know children well and have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with them. Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn about the local and wider community and events.</p><p>Successful transitions support children's movement within the centre's four learning spaces and enables partnerships between families, services and schools.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager is experienced and has recently implemented a number of systems and processes to improve the daily operations of the centre.</p><p>For the provision of under two learning spaces, direct access to an outdoor play area needs to be developed. This will enable children to learn in an holistic environment, explore Papatūānuku and reflect the principles in <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for the centre are to develop key aspects in leadership, management and governance. Particular priority is to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening self review across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building and supporting professional practice and ensure teachers have time to critically reflect on their practice through documenting a robust appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaders promoting opportunities for whānau to take an active role in their children’s learning, particularly for whānau of children who access the centre transport.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, children will benefit from an internal review that focuses on the increased provision of resourcing to support children to choose from a range of activities, experience challenges and revisit prior learning. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management, administration, premises and facilities. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the design and layout of the premise to support infants access to an outdoor space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system of regular appraisal for teaching staff and the centre manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the purchasing of resources and age appropriate learning equipment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF1, PF2, PF13, GMA7, GMA9]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>6 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
