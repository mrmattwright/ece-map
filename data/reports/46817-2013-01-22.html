<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2>
</div><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Stokes Valley Community Childcare Centre Inc. is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.<b></b></p><h3>Context</h3><p>Stokes Valley Community Childcare Centre Inc is in its fifth year of operation.&nbsp; It is a community based service governed by a committee of parents. The centre is licensed for 26 children, including five children aged under two. Most teaching staff have been part of the centre since it was opened. Teachers and children mainly represent Pacific, M&#257;ori and New Zealand European cultures. The centre receives two components of equity funding from the Ministry of Education which have been used in identified ways to assist in the provision of education for children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy of a warm, fun and safe learning space for children is highly evident.&nbsp; Understanding and pride in M&#257;oritanga and Fa&rsquo;a Samoa is valued by teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversations between teachers and children are purposeful and they encourage children to participate in all aspects of the programme. Interactions between teachers and children are calm and supportive.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>Further open-ended questioning to extend children&rsquo;s interests and challenge their working theories is a next step.</li>
</ul><p>Programme planning is based on children&rsquo;s interests and needs. Teachers manage the programme in an age-appropriate way. Overall learning outcomes for each group allow teachers to concentrate on specific skills each school term. Teachers are supported to initiate developments in the programme.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s portfolios highlight their experiences while in the centre. Teachers use a &lsquo;notice, recognise and respond&rsquo; approach to assessment. Clear descriptive narratives identify children&rsquo;s learning, developing skills and interests. Teachers&rsquo; responses to children&rsquo;s learning is identified, with some progress over time monitored and recorded. The voices of children, parents and teachers are regularly captured in assessments.&nbsp;</p><p>The transition to school process is well considered. A purposeful programme for four year olds is planned on their interests and identified skills. Opportunities for children to explore and understand early literacy, numeracy and science concepts are provided and incorporated into this focused group time. Supportive relationships with a local school allow students to attend the centre to participate in buddy reading with children.</p><p>Leaders encourage and support teachers to develop their teaching practice. Reflective conversations and individual termly evaluations inform the teachers' appraisal process and possible areas for ongoing learning. Well-established relationships with other centres and schools provide a good network of support and opportunities to work collaboratively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>Teachers should continue to reflect on and evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching and how it impacts on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of self review are well embedded, although some processes focus on development rather than evaluation. Recent self review has identified current good practice and areas in which teachers can implement new ideas within the centre. Staff and leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop a deeper understanding of self review to support ongoing improvements</li>
<li>ensure that evaluative self review allows teachers and leaders to identify impacts of changes made on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>A strong culture of reflective practice promotes the centre&rsquo;s vision and its associated goals. The current five year strategic plan has been developed in response to the priorities identified by leaders and committee members. Policies are reviewed as part of a review cycle and in consultation with parents, wh&#257;nau and teachers. The governing parent committee is well informed by the management team. &nbsp;</p><p>Positive relationships with local groups and personnel, and support from a lead teacher assist teachers to strengthen te ao M&#257;ori in the curriculum.</p><ul>
<li>A focused strategic vision for implementation of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori within the programme should support teachers to further embed a bicultural approach in the curriculum and identify professional development needs to build leadership capacity within the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The service receives two components of equity funding from the Ministry of Education. Management has identified that this funding has assisted in initiatives for children and teacher development. Information about funding use is shared with parents and the community.&nbsp;</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stokes Valley Community Childcare Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.&nbsp; In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region (Acting)</p><p>22 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
