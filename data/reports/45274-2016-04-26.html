</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Napier is located in the suburb of Ahuriri. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 100 children, including 25 up to two years of age. There has been a recent increase in enrolments of infants and toddlers. The centre is made up of four areas to cater for the different age groups of children.</p><p>Since the March 2013 ERO report, there has been a change of ownership, centre director and team leaders. The centre is now owned and operated under the umbrella of the national early childhood organisation, Evolve Education Group. The organisation provides personnel, finance, marketing and policy development support. Governance roles and responsibilities are clear. The centre's business plans are directly linked to Evolve's strategic and operational plans. Locally, an area manager provides support to the centre linked to centre or regional goals.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Lollipops Educare Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know children and their whƒÅnau well. Children, their parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed. Responsive and respectful relationships are formed with each family, supporting children‚Äôs sense of belonging.</p><p>The guiding philosophy, evident in practice, is based on fostering children's sense of belonging and identity within a nurturing environment where teachers follow the interests of children.</p><p>Children learn and play in a calm, unhurried and respectful environment. There is a focus on natural resources to promote curiosity and inquiry. Children are supported to be independent, to problem solve and to lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers actively promote each child's emotional and social competence. Staff participation in the Ministry of Education's <em>Incredible Years Programme</em>, has resulted in consistency of practice for supporting learning.</p><p>Quiet learning areas cater for children up to two years of age and their specific needs and interests. Key teachers supports children's sense of belonging, security and wellbeing. Teachers respond to the natural rhythms and individual needs of children within a flexible programme. Catering for the needs of this group has been a focus of recent teacher professional learning and development (PLD) and internal evaluation.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum responsive to their interests and aspirations of families and whƒÅnau, based on <em>Te</em> <em>WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers support children's interests by providing opportunities through conversations, resources and activities. Literacy and mathematics experiences are integral to the daily programme. Children's profile books and online documentation capture their learning.</p><p>Teachers have identified the need to review assessment, planning and evaluation practices to improve how they recognise and respond to children's learning. Strengthening the use of deliberate teaching to ensure consistency of practice across the centre is a next step.</p><p>There is a centre-wide focus on active movement and providing many different opportunities for children to develop their physical skills. This includes regular excursions to the local school and park.</p><p>Teachers engage parents and whƒÅnau through a range of formal and informal communication strategies. They value families' aspirations for their children, feedback and ideas.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are incorporated into daily practice. Teachers seek ways to share expertise across the team. They have identified the need to broaden their knowledge of iwi aspirations to better integrate the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children. This should strengthen teachers' cultural competencies and practices to better support MƒÅori success. The use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> should further support this development.</p><p>Successful transitions into and within the centre are well supported. They respond to children's individual needs and teachers shared information. Teachers are developing relationships with local schools to support older children as they transition to school.</p><p>Professional learning contributes to collaborative teaching. Teachers regularly reflect and share. Leadership opportunities are promoted. Team leaders work collaboratively within a team. Leaders and teachers are well supported by the centre director.</p><p>A useful appraisal process is in place to support teacher development. Clear links are made to the Practising Teacher Criteria. Teachers develop action plans to assist goal setting and have opportunities for regular feedback on their practice. A key next step is to ensure all teachers have sufficient evidence to show they are meeting Education Council requirements.</p><p>A useful process guides internal evaluation. Centre-wide PLD has led to a shared understanding of evaluation for improvement. Teachers should continue to strengthen this process to evaluate the impact of changes over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that the key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment practices and deliberate teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further strengthen te ao MƒÅori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding of evaluation and inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Napier completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Next ERO Review</p><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Napier will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
