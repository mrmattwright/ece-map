</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Levin Playcentre Incorporated is one of 20 playcentres managed by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review forms part of a sample of five education reviews carried out in association playcentres during Term 2 2013.</p><p>The service operates as a family cooperative catering for children from birth to six years of age, five mornings a week. The playcentre philosophy ‘whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together’ is reflected in the collaborative planning and organising of the programme. As result of recent self review the centre programme has been extended to include a weekly afternoon session for children aged up to one year.</p><p>The centre, administered as an incorporated society, is a parent-run cooperative with experienced supervisors who work collaboratively with the management committee and parents. Effective management of financial resources enables the centre leaders to maintain high quality facilities and equipment. An association liaison officer provides regular assistance and input to support all adults in their role as educators. All parents have, or are working towards attaining, Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>Māori perspectives, te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are well integrated into governance and management procedures and teaching practices. The outdoor environment includes natural features, plants, materials and textures to enrich learning opportunities. Children’s independence and choice are fostered by easy access to a wide range of resources and equipment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Supervisors and parents have established a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed. A high level of relational trust is established among all adults involved in the service. Collaborative ways of working enable parents to be actively involved in the learning, wellbeing and development of all children.</p><p>Educators have clear and shared expectations and processes for responding to children’s strengths, interests, abilities and needs. Opportunities are provided for parents and whānau to contribute their perspectives to the design of centre programmes. Leadership is encouraged and distributed amongst parents and staff across the centre. Appropriate professional development is provided to support needs and aspirations of leaders and parents.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor spaces encourage children to learn, explore, develop their physical skills and engage in imaginative, creative play. The environment provides well for the physical and emotional wellbeing of very young children. Early literacy and numeracy learning opportunities are effectively integrated in the programme and environment.</p><p>Children are purposefully engaged in learning and confidently make decisions about their involvement and participation. Responsive and flexible routines support children's engagement in sustained and purposeful play. Infants and toddlers are supported to interact and play with older children.</p><p>Children’s learning is recorded meaningfully in attractive profiles and analysed to decide next steps for development. Recent initiatives have successfully increased parents’ involvement in assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning.</p><p>The bicultural perspective of New Zealand is positively reflected throughout the centre. Children’s cultural identity is acknowledged and celebrated. Success for Māori children is effectively promoted. Appropriate resources, displays and practices that reflect te ao Māori, enable children to develop knowledge and understanding of their dual heritage. Parents are committed to developing their practice to continue to support Māori children achieve success as Māori.</p><p>Well thought out, clear strategies support children and their families’ induction into the centre. Children’s transitions to school are acknowledged and celebrated using appropriate practices that reinforce their individual culture and identity.</p><p>A robust self-review process, focused on outcomes, is well embedded and used to enhance learning experiences for children and inform strategic direction.</p><p>The centre’s governance and management systems, policies and procedures effectively promote positive outcomes for all children. The centre philosophy, aligned with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and Tiriti o Waitangi, is reviewed annually.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have effective systems and procedures for monitoring, sharing and reporting on initiatives and curriculum developments. They have identified, and ERO affirms, that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate curriculum effectiveness for supporting Māori children to achieve success as Māori</li>
<li>expand the annual plan to more explicitly define educational goals and expected outcomes</li>
<li>evaluate the impact of changes implemented as a result of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Levin Playcentre Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Levin Playcentre Incorporated will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
