</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hawea Kindergarten provides care and education for up to 30 children from two to five years of age. Children from a wide geographical area attend. The kindergarten has a rural setting in close proximity to the mountains and Lake Hawea, and is close to the local school. The children and their families are from a variety of cultures and nationalities.</p><p>The teachers have all been at the kindergarten since it began in 2008. They know the children and community well. There is strong community support for the work they do. The supportive parent committee has raised substantial funds to extend the building and develop the environment.</p><p>Teachers have successfully addressed the recommendations made in the 2011 and 2012 ERO reports.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Central Otago Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p><em>Relationships.</em> Children and their teachers enjoy each other‚Äôs company. Well-established friendships between children were noticed by ERO. Children and their teachers are calm and settled and have caring and respectful interactions with each other. Teachers focus on providing children with strategies to successfully interact with others, such as negotiating, problem solving and turns taking. They encourage children to help and support others (tuakana-teina relationships). Children are confident of their place within the kindergarten and make decisions about the programme that teachers respond to. Teachers work collegially with each other. This benefits all children.</p><p><em>Curriculum.</em> Children learn through a rich variety of experiences. Teachers use children‚Äôs interests as the basis for planning interesting experiences to support children‚Äôs learning. Teachers make effective use of local geographical features and local expertise to enrich the programme, such as a parent going to the Winter Adaptive Olympics. An aspect of the programme focuses on sustainability. Members of the community and the children take responsibility for this with the garden and recycling. Teachers expect children to take an appropriate level of responsibility for themselves and support them to grow in independence.</p><p>Children hear and use te reo MƒÅori throughout the day. Waiata and karakia are a regular part of the programme. Events of importance, such as MƒÅtariki, are celebrated. A MƒÅori parent takes a group time each week to support children‚Äôs growing awareness of te ao and te reo MƒÅori (the MƒÅori world).</p><p><em>Teaching.</em> Teachers provide high quality learning opportunities for children. This is done through:</p><ul>
<li>having genuine learning conversations with children and making connections between their homes and what they do at kindergarten</li>
<li>including all children and their families in positive ways, for example using sign language, computer communication and emails</li>
<li>supporting children with speech and language difficulties</li>
<li>a well designed, stimulating environment that reflects the community children live in.</li>
</ul><p><em>Planning and assessment.</em> The head teacher and teachers have developed and implemented an effective system to ensure that all children are regularly assessed and planned for. They have identified various groupings of children at the kindergarten and plan in depth to meet the particular needs and interests of each group and individual children. They include the contexts and strategies they will use to support children‚Äôs learning. Plans cover a wide range of interesting topics and learning areas.</p><p><em>Leadership.</em> The head teacher provides effective professional leadership. Effective systems are in place for the smooth running of the kindergarten. A useful strategic plan provides focus and sets out the priorities for the next three years.</p><h3><em>Governance</em></h3><p>Over the past three years the Central Otago Kindergarten Association has gone through an unsettled period. There was a break down in governance, management and systems. This has adversely affected the effectiveness and level of leadership provided to each kindergarten. This led to the board contracting Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens) in 2012 to undertake an independent review of the management structure. Then in September 2013, Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association was contacted again to provide management support and guidance in an effort to establish robust systems, competent leadership and management. The process for redevelopment is still underway. Overall, there has been a substantial turnover of teachers within the wider association. New systems are being established and at the time of this review, ERO found it was too early to tell how well they would be implemented. ERO also found that the association‚Äôs appraisal process was not robust and needs further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO found the systems and processes for self review within the Hawea Kindergarten were bringing about positive changes. Self review could be further strengthened by including a strong evaluative question and indicators to show what best practice looks like in the process. Currently, teachers evaluate the strategies and programmes they use. These could lead to more effective practice if teachers investigate how well they met their intended outcomes and what they could change to do better.</p><p>The teachers have developed a shared understanding of the approaches they may take and the expectations for high-quality practice.</p><p>It would be useful if these expectations were documented. This would help maintain consistency in teachers‚Äô practice and ensure that new teachers know the centre‚Äôs expectations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hawea Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hawea Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
