</table><p>Glen Eden Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glen Eden Kindergarten is licensed for 40 children aged two years and over, and offers six-hour days. It serves a culturally diverse community. The recently developed kindergarten philosophy reflects teachers' respect for te ao Māori.</p><p>The head teacher is supported by three other registered teachers, and a teacher aide. The kindergarten plans to recruit an administrator.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted a welcoming and inclusive environment and teachers' commitment to bicultural practices. These positive aspects continue to be present and bicultural practice has been enhanced. The report recommended improvements in internal evaluation. Good progress has been made in this area.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development. The AKA is establishing new roles and responsibilities at management and governance levels. Recruitment of appropriate personnel to fill identified roles is underway.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the AKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a sense of belonging at the kindergarten. They take some responsibility for their own and others' wellbeing, reflecting manaakitanga, one of the kindergarten's values. They take on leadership roles in caring for the environment and the animals at the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are engaged, independent and choose where to play. They are respectful with each other and with teachers and adults. Older children often support their younger peers.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn te reo Māori in meaningful and enjoyable ways. Teachers have embedded aspects of tikanga in everyday practices. Children benefit from teachers' knowledge and understanding of te ao me ngā tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers affirm, and provide resources that reflect, children's diverse cultural backgrounds. They plan to continue strengthening their responses to children's cultural backgrounds and languages.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They access external guidance and parents' input to plan programmes and strategies for individual children. They have developed appreciative approaches to working with younger children and those children with additional learning needs. Children and whānau are well supported to integrate into the kindergarten.</p><p>Parents who spoke to ERO report their satisfaction with teachers' calm, quiet approach. They are appreciative of their own and other cultures being acknowledged and celebrated. As a result of the positive and affirming relationships, whānau are comfortable to stay and settle children when needed.</p><p>Teachers collaboratively plan learning programmes based on children's interests. The events, celebrations and learning experiences provided for children are carefully recorded in portfolios and online. Outcomes for children are positive. This is because teachers provide varied play experiences, unhurried interactions and routines, and good support for children to develop social competence skills.</p><p>A robust framework is used for internal evaluation. The process is collaborative, and teachers have opportunities to add individual reflections. Strategic appointments of teachers, an in-depth strategic evaluation, and relevant professional learning have resulted in strengthened bicultural practices.</p><p>Leaders promote a collegial workplace culture. Regular meeting opportunities embedded into the appraisal process support teachers' professional growth. Teachers find the professional development offered by the AKA useful and informative. This support has helped them to develop a vision and to contribute to the priorities for the kindergarten.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to continue strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>records of teachers' critical thinking and evaluation discussions to measure the impact of teaching strategies on children's learning</li>
<li>records of children's learning through assessment and planning</li>
<li>the integration of literacy and numeracy in the context of play in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>It would be useful for AKA to:</p><ul>
<li>monitor that all part time or relieving teachers are well informed about AKA policies and procedures</li>
<li>increase support to improve assessment practices, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to support teachers to fully implement <em>Te Whāriki 2017.</em> </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Eden Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glen Eden Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Northern<br>Northern Region</p><p>15 February 2019 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
