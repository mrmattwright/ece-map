<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Footsteps Education Ltd 40327 is a privately owned and operated home-based care service. Previously known as Linmark the service has been under new ownership and management since 2008. It caters for children up to the age of five years and includes children under the guardianship of Child, Youth and Families Services (CYFS). The network is chartered for 80 children and at the time of this review had 40 children, eight of whom identified as M&#257;ori. This is the first review for this charter.</p><p>The service is governed by an enthusiastic team, providing sound management from a central national office in Tauranga. Clear administration and policy frameworks guide network operations. A qualified and experienced regional leader provides support and professional guidance for two kaiako (registered early childhood teachers) and ensures the effective operation of the network. This team maintains positive relationships with caregivers and children and is dedicated to providing a quality service. Footsteps management have recently developed an action plan to monitor health and safety matters in caregivers homes.</p><p>Caregivers and children demonstrate caring and respectful interactions. Children are settled in their home environments, play confidently alongside caregivers and receive affection and nurture from them. Kaiako support and develop caregivers&rsquo; understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and development are recorded in Learning Journey books.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s strengths and interests form the basis of their learning. They are able to explore and persist in their play in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. There are many opportunities for children to develop their early literacy and mathematical concepts. Babies and toddlers receive nurture and care in appropriate environments that contribute to their wellbeing and development.</p><p>Strategic planning and self review should now focus on improving aspects of health and safety in caregiver&rsquo;s homes and enhancing learning experiences for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Footsteps Education Ltd 40327 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by Footsteps Education Ltd 40327 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atFootsteps Education Ltd 40327.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Footsteps Education Ltd. 40327 is a chartered service established in 2008 in the Auckland region. It provides home-based education for children, including children in foster care, where Child, Youth and Family Services (CYFS) are the guardian. The service aims to provide a quality, strengths-based early childhood education. Education Review Officers visited four caregiver homes (11%) during the review. Two kaiako, who are qualified early childhood teachers, provide educational support to the caregivers and children. A regional leader has overall responsibility for the operation of the network and reports to the umbrella organisation. This is the first Education Review report for this charter.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Governance and management: The directors and management team have developed effective management systems to support service operations and professional practice. They provide clear expectations and guidelines for regional leaders, kaiako and caregivers through comprehensive documentation and open communication. A robust appraisal process provides staff with effective professional guidance. A particular strength of management is self review and the effective use made of external specialists to guide and inform the development and improvement of the service.</p><p>Professional leadership: The qualified and experienced regional leader provides effective professional guidance and support for two kaiako. They meet regularly as a group and with relevant external agencies to discuss the needs of caregivers and children in the network. This knowledgeable and competent team maintain collegial relationships as they undertake the day-to-day running of the network.</p><p>Interactions: Positive, caring and responsive interactions are evident between children, caregivers and kaiako. Children are settled in their home environments, play confidently alongside caregivers, and receive affection and nurture from them.</p><p>Kaiako skilfully include useful information in their conversations to support and develop caregivers&rsquo; understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They effectively model positive and encouraging interactions for learning. Kaiako use conversations with children that notice and build on their strengths and interests.</p><p>Programme: Dedicated caregivers provide a range of learning opportunities for children that:</p><ul>
<li>are responsive to their cultural heritage;</li>
<li>include interesting and meaningful daily activities and experiences;</li>
<li>support developing literacy and mathematical concepts; and</li>
<li>build on identified strengths and interests.</li>
</ul><p>Some children regularly attend early childhood centres.</p><p>Kaiako and caregivers provide extra resources and record aspects of individual children&rsquo;s learning in learning journey books. These books are a record of children&rsquo;s participation in activities during their time in care. Kaiako visit notes provide high quality evidence of children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p>Learning environments: Children receive good quality care and a range of opportunities for learning in suitable and diverse home environments. Children enjoy a variety of age-appropriate resources in both indoor and outdoor settings that encourage them to make choices, explore and persist in their play. There are examples of outdoor settings that provide children with physical challenge and links to the natural world. Caregivers&rsquo; homes provide children with environments that contribute to their wellbeing and development.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Strategic planning and self review: There is a need to strengthen the documentation link between review practices and strategic planning. Particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>documenting the linking of strategic goals to the appraisal process and professional development;</li>
<li>improving the durability of children&rsquo;s learning journals/portfolio files to make them more accessible and visible;</li>
<li>reviewing the use and purpose of resources; and</li>
<li>improving quality assurance, in particular the standard of health and safety in caregivers&rsquo; homes.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects should enable the service to more effectively monitor progress.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>At the time of the review eight children who identify as M&#257;ori were enrolled in this service. An independent review in 2009 on staff capability and understanding resulted in developing the initiative &lsquo;Ara Poutama&rsquo; in consultation with local iwi. The objective of &lsquo;Ara Poutama&rsquo; is to build staff understanding in te reo me ona tikanga Maori. The service has been implementing some areas of this review.</p><h3>Area of strength</h3><p>Bicultural perspectives: Regional leaders and staff demonstrate a willingness to strengthen the integration of te ao M&#257;ori across the service. Aspects of M&#257;ori culture are visible and valued at many levels of operations. M&#257;ori children are cared for in homes that reflect and value whanaugatanga.</p><p>Relationships and interactions are welcoming and positive for M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. Kanohi ki te kanohi conversations are highly valued and form an important part of the way information is shared between kaiako and caregivers. Learning stories are written in holistic contexts, use te reo and include wh&#257;nau and children&rsquo;s voices.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p>Implementing &lsquo;Ara Poutama&rsquo;: An important next step for the service is to fully implement and sustain the recommendations of the 2009 bicultural review. This should include;</p><ul>
<li>developing the confidence and competence of staff in their use of te reo me &#333;na tikanga; and</li>
<li>reviewing the range of resources that reflect M&#257;ori cultural values available for kaiako, caregivers and children.</li>
</ul><p>Clearly linking the aims of &lsquo;Ara Poutama&rsquo; to strategic planning should enable the service to monitor progress.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Footsteps Education Ltd 40327 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the service arranger agreed that:</p><p>5.1 strategic planning would be strengthened by documenting the link between review recommendations and strategic goals.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

</table><p>22 March 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-footsteps-education-ltd-40327" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Footsteps Education Ltd 40327</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Footsteps Education Ltd (40327).</p><p>Footsteps Education Ltd 40327 is a privately owned and operated home-based care service. Previously known as Linmark the service has been under new ownership and management since 2008. It caters for children up to the age of five years and includes children under the guardianship of Child, Youth and Families Services (CYFS). The network is chartered for 80 children and at the time of this review had 40 children, eight of whom identified as M&#257;ori. This is the first review for this charter.</p><p>The service is governed by an enthusiastic team, providing sound management from a central national office in Tauranga. Clear administration and policy frameworks guide network operations. A qualified and experienced regional leader provides support and professional guidance for two kaiako (registered early childhood teachers) and ensures the effective operation of the network. This team maintains positive relationships with caregivers and children and is dedicated to providing a quality service. Footsteps management have recently developed an action plan to monitor health and safety matters in caregivers homes.</p><p>Caregivers and children demonstrate caring and respectful interactions. Children are settled in their home environments, play confidently alongside caregivers and receive affection and nurture from them. Kaiako support and develop caregivers&rsquo; understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Aspects of children&rsquo;s learning and development are recorded in Learning Journey books.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s strengths and interests form the basis of their learning. They are able to explore and persist in their play in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. There are many opportunities for children to develop their early literacy and mathematical concepts. Babies and toddlers receive nurture and care in appropriate environments that contribute to their wellbeing and development.</p><p>Strategic planning and self review should now focus on improving aspects of health and safety in caregiver&rsquo;s homes and enhancing learning experiences for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
