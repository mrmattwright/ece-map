</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nannies Plus is licensed to provide home-based education and care for 80 children, from birth to school age, in the greater Wellington region. Currently there are 70 children on the roll, six of whom are Māori. The children are cared for in their own homes by either qualified or student nannies. Most of the older children also attend another early childhood service.</p><p>The service is privately owned. The ownership of the business has changed twice since the February 2013 ERO report. The owners also operate New Zealand Career College's nanny programme that works alongside Nannies Plus and its sister service Nannies Plus 2.</p><p>Three fully qualified and registered visiting teachers provide support for the nannies through monthly visits to observe children and regular phone and online communication.</p><p>Sound progress has been made in meeting the issues identified in the previous ERO review. These included developing bicultural practice and engaging parents in self-review processes.</p><p>This review was conducted at the same time as that for Nannies Plus 2 service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Nannies Plus is well placed to provide children with high quality education and care within a home environment.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum that is responsive to individual needs and choices. As learning takes place within the child's home, consistency with family culture, values and aspirations is enabled. Nannies know the children well and work collaboratively to meet parent aspirations.</p><p>Opportunities are taken to extend children's interests through excursions that include the local library, museum, and park. The service also operates a playgroup. This enables children to socialise and nannies to share and learn about good practice.</p><p>A strength of the service is the partnership with the New Zealand Career College that provides a range of tertiary courses and qualifications to support nannies in their educator role. Nannies are also closely monitored and supported by visiting teachers who provide curriculum guidance and maintain links with the family.</p><p>Children's learning stories, written by nannies, show the development of children's skills, knowledge and progress over time. These are attractively presented. Input from the families is evident.</p><p>The service's revised philosophy now expresses a commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Since the 2013 ERO review, considerable steps have been taken to raise nannies' and visiting teachers' awareness of bicultural perspectives. Teachers have enrolled in courses offered by Māori providers and encourage nannies, who identify as Māori, to contribute to the group's knowledge.</p><p>The service provides support for nannies working with children from Pacific ethnic groups. The next step is to evaluate how well the programme to promotes educational success for Pacific children.</p><p>Children's health and safety is a priority for the service. Sound systems and processes are in place. Nannies keep detailed records that are monitored by the visiting teacher. Spot checking practice is also undertaken. Areas of concern are discussed with families and support is provided to remedy potential hazards.</p><p>The service has a rigorous and developmental appraisal system for visiting teachers, who receive professional development to support continuing professional knowledge. It is timely to document the process to facilitate consistency and make the service's expectations for performance clear.</p><p>Nannies have an annual appraisal that includes comments from the family.</p><p>The service is improvement focused. There is an established culture of self review. Over recent years Nannies Plus has conducted a range of spontaneous and strategic reviews that have led to positive change. The next step is to use a more evaluative process to better inform decisions that support sustained improvement to practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the manager agree that the next key steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop appraisal policies and procedures</li>
<li>review the impact of changes made as a result of internal evaluations</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the service's programme to promote educational success for Pacific children</li>
<li>continue to support nannies to integrate reo me ngā tikanga Māori into their work with children.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nannies Plus completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nannies Plus will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>12 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
