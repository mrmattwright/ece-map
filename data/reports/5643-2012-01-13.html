<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>The Karori kindergarten, formerly Wright&rsquo;s Hill Kindergarten caters for children from two to five years of age. The kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>The association has developed a sound strategic plan to guide the teachers in developing a philosophy and plan that is appropriate for the children and families of the kindergarten. It has also introduced Te Manawa, a set of criteria to guide curriculum implementation. Teachers are in the early stages of incorporating this initiative into centre practices.</p><p>Since the April 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has restructured and increased its session hours, expanded the teaching team, improved the teacher/child ratios, and has transformed the indoor and outdoor environments. The site is well developed, well resourced and used to its full potential.</p><p>The teachers have continued to develop the programme and are focusing on improving their approach to self review. They are reflective practitioners and work well as a team. Staff know the children and families well.</p><p>Children experience a programme that is developed around their interests. The teachers support them in individual and group play. Children interact well in a positive learning environment.</p><p>The wide range of resources and activities allows children to explore and express their ideas during play. They are secure, confident and show a strong sense of belonging. The parents/wh&#257;nau are also comfortable in this environment. They participate in the programme and have informed discussions about their children with the teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten is particularly supportive of children who have moderate special needs. The spacious physical environment and rich resources provide opportunities for children to play independently or be part of groups.</p><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning practices. The next challenge is to implement these in a consistent and robust manner.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Karori Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Karori Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the April 2008 ERO review of the kindergarten, formerly known as Wright&rsquo;s Hill Kindergarten, has been relicensed as an all-day service and as a result, has improved ratios of teachers to children. There has been a complete change of teaching staff and developments in the association&rsquo;s curriculum expectations. The philosophy has been reviewed and teachers have developed a draft procedure for curriculum implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Programme</h5><p>Children experience a programme that is planned around their interests. The programme is varied and provides a wide range of opportunities for children to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>Children are supported to become independent and responsible learners. They are encouraged to share ideas and play spaces and to play cooperatively and collaboratively. The teachers organise flexible routines and meaningful group activities to support children&rsquo;s interests. Children&rsquo;s behaviour and interactions are effectively fostered through clear expectations and consistent boundaries.</p><p>Teachers guide the children&rsquo;s learning and usually help them form their ideas and concepts through effective questioning. Literacy, drama activities, and natural science are strongly emphasised and extended, with the parents/wh&#257;nau and through excursions.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers record children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme through attractive art displays and individual child portfolios. Teachers are working towards showing more clearly how they add depth and complexity to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Individual portfolios are well presented and informative and many parents regularly contribute. Children have a strong sense of ownership of these records. They spend time looking through their portfolios, reflecting on their learning, re-visiting past group experiences, and sharing them with others.</p><p>The association has recently introduced an improved approach to self review. Teachers are beginning to use these strategies to review their programme and have evidence that some of their spontaneous reviews have improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are confident in their use of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and this is best demonstrated during mat times when children participate confidently and enthusiastically in haka, karakia and developing vocabulary.</p><h5>Environment</h5><p>The physical environment is well developed and used to its full potential. The kindergarten is well resourced. The variety of equipment, which varies in challenge and complexity, facilitates a wide range of rich learning experiences.</p><p>The good flow from the indoors through to the outdoor play spaces enables children take advantage of the opportunities provided by both areas.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging is enhanced through the environment. For example, each child&rsquo;s photo is displayed, they have their personal lockers, a wh&#257;nau tree is prominent and name cards at the entry contribute to a sense of &ldquo;my place&rdquo;.</p><h5>Interactions</h5><p>The interactions between teachers and children and among children are warm and responsive. Teachers praise and affirm children&rsquo;s developing skills. This contributes to them feeling secure and confident and demonstrating a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Staff support one another <span>and model responsive relationships for children and families.</span> This positive team spirit contributes to <span>a purposeful and harmonious atmosphere. Children experience a respectful and trusting environment.</span></p><p>Teachers know children in the context of their family. They have a wide range of communication methods to share information with wh&#257;nau about the programme and the children&rsquo;s day. Parents are comfortable and confident to spend time in the kindergarten and actively participate in the programme.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The teachers and ERO agree that the next step in the self review process is to evaluate the programme to see if it can be strengthened.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen their support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>The association has a policy and procedures to ensure all children attending the kindergarten are respected as learners and have equitable access to support and resources for their learning. There are good processes for appropriate and safe inclusion for children with special learning needs and their family.</p><p>The kindergarten is particularly supportive of children who have moderate special needs. The spacious physical environment and rich resources provide opportunities for children to play independently or be part of groups.</p><p>The teachers know the children well and all teachers play an active role in facilitating play, encouraging socialisation, observing and documenting behaviours.

</table><p>13 January 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-karori-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Karori Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Karori Kindergarten.</p><p>The Karori kindergarten, formerly Wright&rsquo;s Hill Kindergarten caters for children from two to five years of age. The kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>The association has developed a sound strategic plan to guide the teachers in developing a philosophy and plan that is appropriate for the children and families of the kindergarten. It has also introduced Te Manawa, a set of criteria to guide curriculum implementation. Teachers are in the early stages of incorporating this initiative into centre practices.</p><p>Since the April 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has restructured and increased its session hours, expanded the teaching team, improved the teacher/child ratios, and has transformed the indoor and outdoor environments. The site is well developed, well resourced and used to its full potential.</p><p>The teachers have continued to develop the programme and are focusing on improving their approach to self review. They are reflective practitioners and work well as a team. Staff know the children and families well.</p><p>Children experience a programme that is developed around their interests. The teachers support them in individual and group play. Children interact well in a positive learning environment.</p><p>The wide range of resources and activities allows children to explore and express their ideas during play. They are secure, confident and show a strong sense of belonging. The parents/wh&#257;nau are also comfortable in this environment. They participate in the programme and have informed discussions about their children with the teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten is particularly supportive of children who have moderate special needs. The spacious physical environment and rich resources provide opportunities for children to play independently or be part of groups.</p><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning practices. The next challenge is to implement these in a consistent and robust manner.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
