</table><p>Church Corner Nest is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Church Corner Nest is an early childhood education and care service which operates under the NESTS NZ Ltd Franchise. This small centre is owned and operated by a qualified early childhood practitioner who has had extensive experience in managing early childhood education services. All staff are fully trained teachers. Most of them have been at the centre since it opened in 2014.</p><p>The centre caters for children from birth-to-school age in a mixed-age group, home-like setting. Older and younger children, from a diverse community, learn and play alongside one another. A primary-care teacher is allocated to support each family.</p><p>The owner/manager and staff have been very responsive in addressing all areas identified for improvement in the 2015 ERO report. This includes strengthening planning, assessment and internal evaluation processes. A parent committee has been established to help gather parent opinions, feedback and contributions to the curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the shared centre vision and philosophy. Valued outcomes for children are clearly identified and evident in key documentation, the environment, and in teachers 'ways of doing' and 'ways of being' at the centre. Children are at the heart of all decision making.</p><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed. Teachers foster caring and respectful relationships which promote a positive sense of belonging for families. Teachers have a genuine interest in children's home life, language and culture. Children with additional needs are very well supported within an inclusive environment. Children under two years old are nurtured within a family/whƒÅnau setting where teacher-child-family relationships provide a positive sense of security. Teachers work effectively in partnership with parents to provide predictable centre routines that are aligned to each child's home routine.</p><p>Teachers encourage and support children to see themselves as competent and capable learners and communicators within a well-paced, child-led curriculum. The natural home-like environment is carefully considered and purposefully presented to provoke children's imagination, curiosity and problem solving. Children are given long periods of uninterrupted time to explore, test their own learning theories, and develop independence and friendships. Oral language, literacy and mathematics are thoughtfully integrated with learning in ways that are meaningful to children. Planned excursions into the local community enrich the curriculum offered to children.</p><p>Management actively promote a culture of embedded inquiry and continuous improvement, including strong reflective and evaluative practices. High expectations and targeted professional development continue to build teacher capability and leadership capacity. Very well written learning records reflect the depth of assessment practices and capture the richness of a curriculum that strongly promotes children's learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner/manager and centre supervisor have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen understandings of te ao MƒÅori and make bicultural practices visible across all centre operations</li>
<li>embed the new appraisal system for teachers and strengthen the management appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Church Corner Nest completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Church Corner Nest will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>20 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
