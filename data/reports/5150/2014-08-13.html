</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leamington Kindergarten is located in the Waikato town of Cambridge and provides both full-day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 48 children were enrolled, of whom six are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten‚Äôs quality of education. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten‚Äôs administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten caters for a diverse community and families come from the surrounding countryside to attend. There has been a recent increase in the roll, including an increase in the numbers of younger children attending. The kindergarten is committed to increasing participation for families by removing barriers where possible.</p><p>Two new teachers were appointed at the beginning of May 2014. A change of ESM occurred at the end of 2013. The head teacher and an experienced teacher remain in their positions and provide continuity for the community through a time of change. There have been significant upgrades to the outdoor environment and storage areas that increase children‚Äôs independent access to materials and equipment.</p><p>Teachers recently reviewed the philosophy, which documents the aim to promote a healthy, peaceful and sustainable kindergarten community.</p><p>The kindergarten has a very positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leamington Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children participate in a well-planned programme that includes a good balance of teacher-led and child-initiated activities. Children are developing positive social skills as they play and interact together with their teachers and friends. Older children are able to be leaders and share their knowledge to support younger children in their learning. Children are learning about sustainability and the natural world, enhanced by the <em>Enviro-schools</em> initiative. They participate in caring for gardens, growing food and flowers, and sharing these with families. Children are developing their early concepts of literacy and mathematics in meaningful contexts, and are learning many ways to express their creativity and love of learning.</p><p>The teaching team is increasingly including aspects of MƒÅori culture in the programme. Children are learning about New Zealand as a bicultural society. MƒÅori children are experiencing success as MƒÅori through their participation in kapa haka, waiata and the close and long-established family relationships in the kindergarten. The kindergarten environment reflects aspects of Pacific culture through resources and displays that are responsive to children and their families from Tonga. Teachers are continuing to build their understanding of integrating the language, culture and identity of all children into the programme.</p><p>The programme is enriched through trips into the wider community and through regular celebrations and events with families. Children explore an interesting, spacious environment that is well designed to encourage them to experiment, investigate and challenge themselves physically. Children have ready access to a plentiful and wide variety of high-quality materials and equipment, including computers.</p><p>Families are well informed about children‚Äôs learning and participation in the programme through attractive displays, regular informal conversations with teachers, individual profile books and the introduction of e-portfolios. Parents have opportunities to contribute their ideas through regular surveys.</p><p>Teachers are enthusiastic and reflective practitioners. They have developed a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for whƒÅnau, families and children. They are skilled at settling children, promoting their independence, affirming their successes and encouraging them to pursue their interests. ERO observed examples of good teaching practices that included:</p><ul>
<li>learning conversations that extend children‚Äôs thinking</li>
<li>modelling positive social interactions and strategies for learning</li>
<li>offering children alternatives to consider when making choices</li>
<li>specific and deliberate use of vocabulary during play for children learning English.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers skilfully include active learners in play and activities that engage them for extended periods of time and develop physical skills related to their areas of interest.</p><p>The experienced head teacher continues to provide effective and professional leadership for the kindergarten. The ESM and head teacher have established a constructive and professional partnership with a focus on providing positive outcomes for children and families. The experienced ESM contributes knowledgeable perspectives and provides valuable support for ongoing development and improvement. The head teacher sets clear expectations for the new teaching team and makes the most of their individual strengths and skills. They are establishing a collegial team culture. The kindergarten families and teachers have identified and documented shared values that link to the kindergarten‚Äôs commitment to sustainability. This ‚Äò<em>Code of Care‚Äô</em> is a unifying factor for the kindergarten community. Teachers are developing useful frameworks and guidelines for regular and ongoing self review that contribute to development and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that self review would be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>making use of researched, specific and measureable criteria</li>
<li>gathering multiple voices including children, whƒÅnau and families</li>
<li>monitoring and analysing the effectiveness of the results of self review.</li>
</ul><p>This should enable the kindergarten to evaluate the effectiveness of centre operations in contributing to ongoing development and improvement of the kindergarten.</p><p>In addition, teachers should continue to review the ways that individual children‚Äôs learning journeys are documented to ensure this reflects the rich programme, partnerships with whƒÅnau and families and ongoing individual development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leamington Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Leamington Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
