</table><p><span>Active Explorers Ellerslie¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers Ellerslie provides full day care and education for 100 children, including up to 35 aged under two years. Children are cared for in two separate learning areas. Within these two areas children are grouped according to age into five rooms with shared outdoor play spaces. Children are from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and include families of MƒÅori and Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre was previously known as Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre Ellerslie. Since the 2015 ERO review the centre has had a change of ownership and is now part of the Evolve Education Group (EEG). Visiting personnel from EEG support the centre in its day-to-day operations and long-term planning and development projects.</p><p>Leaders are the centre manager and head teachers in each of the learning spaces. Eleven other qualified teachers and eight unqualified, some of whom are teachers in training, complete the teaching team. Their philosophy focuses on the uniqueness of each child and growing inquiring minds. Te Tiriti o Waitangi and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are acknowledged as guiding documents.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Key next steps from the 2015 report included strengthening the use of children's voices in planning the programme, bicultural practices, and embedding the centre's guiding values to enhance curriculum implementation. There has been progress in some of these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive interactions with their teachers. They are confident and articulate and engage in play with their peers and teachers. Children have a sense of ownership and belonging in the centre environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from high adult-to-child ratios. They are relaxed in their environment and receive quality care and attention. Teachers respect children's preferences and understand their individual communication styles well. They have a strong focus on using effective strategies to develop children's oral language skills.</p><p>Children experience karakia and waiata throughout daily routines. Te reo MƒÅori is very visible in the centre environment. Teachers could now use te reo more widely in their interactions with children. Excursions outside the centre to the local library have provided good opportunities for children to engage with myths and legends from MƒÅori and Pacific cultures. Visitors from Orakei Marae have shared te ao MƒÅori knowledge.</p><p>Teachers provide well-considered learning environments, which are attractive, uncluttered and allow easy access to resources. Consideration could now be given to how well outdoor environments offer physical challenges for all children, and how well the range of learning resources available promote children's more complex thinking.</p><p>A wide range of experiences are provided for children. Teachers incorporate mathematics and literacy learning into the programme. Science features well in explorations into a nearby natural area and in different activities provided. There are good opportunities for children to explore their community, and visitors come in to the centre to share expertise in a range of different topics.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes based on their observations of children. Links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are added to learning stories through an on-line resource. The early childhood curriculum could be used more effectively by teachers to plan meaningful programmes for individual children based on their interests, strengths and dispositions. Routines and transition to school programmes could be reviewed using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to ensure they align with current theory.</p><p>Teachers and leaders use a range of strategies to gather parent contributions to surveys and internal evaluation projects. They could now strengthen learning partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau by gathering and responding to parents' aspirations for their child's learning.</p><p>EEG leaders have established an effective process for centres to implement internal evaluation. Leaders in this service could strengthen how they use this process by beginning with an evaluative question. Strategic and annual plans continue to be developed. EEG provides a framework of policies and procedures to guide centre practices. This framework continues to be reviewed. An effective process for staff appraisal is in place. EEG needs to ensure managers are implementing this process effectively.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><p>A deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> 2017, to support:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more meaningful programme planning for individuals and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau based on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cultures of all children being more visible in their portfolios of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the review of routines and transition to school programmes in the preschool rooms.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group senior managers have agreed that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company's vision and values, goals and principles reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addressing staffing issues in some centres to ensure quality teaching practices are evident, promoting positive outcomes for all children and ensuring sustainability of quality practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively the levels and quality of learning resources in centres promote collaboration amongst children and promote more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to ensure a deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Ellerslie completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, Evolve Education Group senior managers must take steps to ensure that health and safety policies and procedures are implemented rigorously across all services.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
