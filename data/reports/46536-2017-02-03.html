</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaliloa Home-Based ECE is one of three home-based education and care networks owned by the service provider. It provides an early childhood education and care service for up to 60 children from infancy to school age. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Most of the children are Tongan and the educators are family members such as grandparents. This is the first ERO review of the service, which was established in 2014 and has seen a fast growth in enrolments.</p><p>The programme coordinators are registered early childhood teachers. She and other service personnel regularly visit educators in the home and support them to plan educational programmes for children as well as monitor health and safety. The provision of a culturally responsive curriculum, based on the Tongan concept of vaa (relationship) and maintaining the Tongan language and culture, is a key aspect of the service's philosophy.</p><p>The service provider/owner works as part of a board to manage the service. Clearly defined roles governance and management roles guide the service's philosophy, vision and strategic direction. An experienced manager and the coordinators take time to build respectful and trusting relationships with children, educators and fanau. Additional staff support the operations and management of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Educators provide a culturally responsive programme that nurtures the Tongan language, culture, and identity. The learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and include some te reo and tikanga Māori. Educators keep good records of each child’s day and note activities that children enjoyed. Children's learning records show that they participate in day-to-day household activities and planned experiences and in homes and in the community. Their experiences include early literacy and opportunities to explore creative and manipulative materials. Children's sense of belonging is affirmed and their emotional and physical wellbeing is supported<em>.</em></p><p>Documentation shows children are happy, confident and learning through play. Children are well supported to settle into educators’ homes. Online electronic records show children's engagement in learning and their caring, warm relationships with educators. Parents give positive feedback on the education and care of their child and the communication from the service that they receive. There is a service wide belief in the cultural and educational benefits of home-based learning for children and their families.</p><p>Strong Tongan cultural values underpin service operations. Relationships between the service leaders, coordinators, educators and parents are respectful, responsive and supportive. Concepts such as talanoa (face to face conversations) guide service practices. Programme coordinators are improvement focused and work to build educators knowledge. They use an individualised approach to affirm and support educators growing skills. Educators receive good support from programme coordinators and benefit from opportunities for ongoing training. This is supported by the fetakinima programme with children and educators sharing and learning together<em>.</em></p><p>Service leaders have a clear focus on continuous improvement and to improve educational outcomes for children. They work in culturally appropriate and collaborative ways as a team and with educators, whānau and the community. Purposeful internal evaluation has been established. External support has helped them to review established practices and identify areas to develop further. The Tongan concept of vaa is at the heart of internal evaluation and service operations<em>.</em></p><p>Sound management, governance and effective administration practices are in place. The philosophy and vision is evident across all service practices and policies. This includes making strategic appointments to achieve this. Educators receive comprehensive documentation, in Tongan and English that provides clear guidelines and good information about the educator role. Rigorous health and safety systems provide assurance that service expectations are being met. A more robust appraisal system, aligned to Practicing Teacher criteria and the service strategic plan would support programme coordinators and other staff to further enhance their professional practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders and ERO agree that key next steps for the service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve how coordinators and educators respond to children’s individual interests and ideas, including provision for children up to two years of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation, including a clearer alignment to strategic planning and evaluation of outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>increase educator knowledge and use of te reo and tikanga Māori in homes.</li>
<li>encourage parent and fanau partnerships in learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaliloa Home-Based ECE completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaliloa Home-Based ECE will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
