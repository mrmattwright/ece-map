</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>No-1 Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service is a privately owned service. This network was established in 2015, is one of five networks in this service and is licensed for 80 children up to five years old. The network provides for children from across the wider Auckland region.</p><p>Educators provide education and care for up to four children at any one time, in their own homes. Children are predominantly from Chinese immigrant families and most of the educators are family members. A team of five coordinators supports educators and oversees their provision of programmes for children. The coordinators are experienced, qualified teachers and are led by a capable lead coordinator. The service is currently in the process of appointing two more coordinators as a result of increasing numbers.</p><p>The service's philosophy promotes the value of language, culture and identity. It is based on the values of respect, collaboration, innovation and providing a high quality service. The philosophy also emphasises the importance of the home as a nurturing place to encourage the cultural, physical, intellectual, spiritual and social needs of each child.</p><p>The owners of the service work closely with the team of dedicated coordinators to provide a quality service and to meet the fast-growing demand for home based education and care in the Chinese community. The administration leader manages the operations of the service. All staff share a common goal to serve the children and families in their service.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of No-1 Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three home-based network reviews in the No-1 Homecare Ltd organisation.¬†</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>No-1 Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service's vision reflects a strong commitment to early childhood education within a Chinese cultural context in Aotearoa. Its values and beliefs recognise how children are enriched through their culture and language.</p><p>The vision and philosophy is well understood and articulated clearly at all levels of the organisation and through the wider Chinese community that it serves. The current review of the philosophy should contribute to the centre's direction and expansion. There is a clear leadership and staffing structure. Lines of communication are well understood in the family oriented organisation.</p><p>Children's learning is recorded in detailed portfolios. Documented observations during teachers' visits show how well they notice children's learning and strengths. Coordinators confidently model assessment practices to build a picture of children's ongoing development. Parents are invited to contribute to the programme for children and are increasingly providing good feedback that informs educators' practice.</p><p>Leadership is highly effective. Leaders focus on building educators' capability in effective teaching. They mentor and support educators to improve their individual skills and collective understanding. Coordinator and educator appraisal processes are successfully guiding effective practice. Leaders have translated <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, into Mandarin. This extensive work has made the curriculum more understandable for educators.</p><p>There is a genuine commitment to recognising <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> and the place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa. The service's curriculum is aligned with the strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Coordinators are working with educators to help them to integrate literacy and numeracy appropriately in children's play. Playgroups and workshops are also helping educators to broaden their understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Strong administration systems support coordinators to focus on their home visits. Coordinators speak several languages and build respectful and trusting relationships with children, educators and families who are integrating into the New Zealand culture and education system. The highly motivated team of coordinators and administrators is committed to and focused on the goal of providing high level education and care.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well understood and a sound framework is used to evaluate practice and guide improvement. Significant improvements in educators' practices and systems for documentation have been the result of ongoing internal evaluation.</p><p>Effective health and safety systems have been established. Thorough initial and annual safety checks are well documented and provide sound evidence of robust processes. Policies and procedures clearly define expectations for coordinators and educators. They are reviewed regularly to ensure they comply with legislative requirements.</p><p>An annual management plan covers all aspects of organisational operations. It clearly identifies priorities that contribute to the service successfully achieving its vision. It is now timely that the leaders and teachers, in consultation with parents and families, develop and implement a strategic plan that is focused on improving outcomes for children.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team agrees that next steps include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>lead and support educators to help them build on their strengths and capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate programme planning processes to focus more on extending children's learning and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen relationships and partnerships with educators, children and families.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of No-1 Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of No-1 Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service¬†</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
