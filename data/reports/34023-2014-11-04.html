</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lintott Community Childcare is located in Hamilton and provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre operates two age group areas, an under two and an over two years centre.</p><p>Lintotts operates under the umbrella of the Hamilton Childcare Services Trust, which is a non- profit charitable trust. The Trust provides governance for three home-based care networks and two childcare centres. Trustees are from existing families and the local community. The Trust‚Äôs mission statement is to provide a choice of quality childcare and educational service in environments that reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and which are supportive of children, families/whƒÅnau and educators.</p><p>Lintotts is managed effectively by an experienced director who provides sound professional leadership and regularly reports to the Trust. The centre is well supported by the additional assistance of a knowledgeable administrative manager and other resource personnel within the organisation.</p><p>The centre benefits from the trusts well-established guidelines and expectations for practice. Clear self-review processes are in place for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care provided for children.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history and continues to provide high-quality education and care.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are welcomed into a homely environment. Babies and young children have established close and trusting relationships with teachers and their peers. These relationships are strongly supported in developing their sense of belonging and wellbeing. In addition the service has a full-time cook who provides nutritious cooked meals for children, which families appreciate.</p><p>Young babies receive personalised care routines with continuity of teachers who work in close partnerships with families/whƒÅnau. Small group size and high-quality teaching, and quality child ratios fosters babies‚Äô emotional wellbeing. A flexible approach to transition from the under-two age group into the over-two age group is sensitive to children‚Äôs feelings, and managed on an individual basis. A key teacher, who works closely with the over-two children, promotes their wellbeing and ensures family aspirations are reflected in their children‚Äôs care and education.</p><p><em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> strongly underpins all aspects of the centre programmes. High-quality child portfolios are well integrated into all aspects of teaching and learning. On-line portfolios provide opportunities for learning experiences to be shared between children‚Äôs homes and the centre. This also enables extended family members to contribute to portfolios. Children use portfolios to revisit previous learning, and teachers use these to extend and build on children‚Äôs learning. This collaborative and multi-perspective assessment process is promoting the centre‚Äôs commitment to building a community of learners.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics concepts are skilfully integrated during child directed and self-initiated play. Teachers have a strong commitment to Te Ao MƒÅori concepts. Whanaungatanga principles of genuine respect, appreciation and support to others are reflected in daily practices. The over-two age group has sound opportunities and processes for transition to school. This includes a summary of children‚Äôs interests, strengths and learning dispositions linked to the key competencies within <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>.</p><p>Teachers view children as capable learners and use a variety of very effective interactions and strategies to engage them in learning. Children learn in meaningful contexts that engage them in sustained and complex learning experiences. They are confident to actively investigate and explore the spacious indoor and outdoor environments that are well prepared with high-quality resources to extend their learning.</p><p>Strong professional leadership is being provided by the long-standing supervisor. There is highly effective, robust and well-developed self-review processes focused on ongoing improvement. Whole centre professional development and research in high-quality literacy practices continues to enhance teaching practice, outcomes for children and improved planning and assessment. Teachers have access to professional development and are up to date with current best practice in early childhood.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO supports the centre‚Äôs future plans to continue with inquiry, research based self-review in mathematics.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lintott Community Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lintott Community Childcare will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>4 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
