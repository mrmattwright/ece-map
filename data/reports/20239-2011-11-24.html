<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Coastal Kids Preschool, located in coastal Beachlands, Auckland, provides care and education for children from two years of age. The centre name and ownership changed in 2009. This is ERO&rsquo;s first review of the centre under its new ownership. The nearby Coastal Kids centre caters for children from three months to five years of age. Both centres operate under the umbrella of the national Kidicorp Organisation.</p><p align="left">A caring and inclusive culture is evident in the centre. Adult interactions with children are warm and friendly. Children&rsquo;s interests form the basis of programme plans. The centre is inclusive of children with special learning needs. Children confidently initiate conversations with adults and each other. Teachers value good communication with parents and wh&#257;nau. Children and parents are familiar with the people and resources in the centre and their sense of belonging in the centre is clearly evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers affirm children&rsquo;s play and invite their involvement in a variety of learning experiences. Children are well supported to develop literacy skills in ways that are appropriate to their age level. Teachers incorporate M&#257;ori language and bicultural perspectives into their teaching practice and the centre environment. There is a need for teachers to further develop programme planning and assessment and to increase their focus on interactions that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers continue to make improvements to the learning environment. Resources are accessible to children so that they can make independent choices. Children have easy access to the outdoor area. The centre manager has identified the need to continue to make improvements that support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">The centre is well managed. The Kidicorp organisation has established a framework of administrative, personnel and support systems to underpin centre operations. The centre manager is developing an effective teaching team. Good self-review systems are in place to help the centre to continue to develop in positive ways.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Coastal Kids - Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atCoastal Kids - Preschool.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of centre management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Coastal Kids Preschool opened under new ownership in 2009. Priorities for the new teaching team have been to develop a shared centre philosophy, examine different practices for programme planning and assessment, and to improve the indoor learning environment for children. The roll has grown considerably and the centre is operating almost at capacity.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Tone and relationships. Children settle quickly on arrival and enjoy warm, positive, relationships with adults and each other. They are respected as capable learners. Staff team work, which supports the development of a positive centre culture and good outcomes for children, is clearly evident.</p><p align="left">Early literacy development. Children are well supported to develop their early literacy understandings and skills. Writing materials are available at all times in different learning areas. Teachers model writing and encourage children to experiment with writing. Children use books independently and often seek adults to read to them. As a result, children have positive attitudes to literacy.</p><p align="left">Approaches to planning and assessment. Teachers are developing effective planning and assessment practices that enable them to provide responsive learning programmes. These practices include programmes that originate from children&rsquo;s emerging interests, and documented learning stories that explain the learning that has taken place. Planning is displayed for children and families to revisit. Regular excursions provide a local context for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Home and centre partnerships. A strength of the centre is the commitment of staff to building and fostering relationships with parents and families. Strategies used by staff include:</p><ul>
<li>providing a welcoming environment that encourages daily conversations between teachers and parents and the exchange of information</li>
<li>the use of a home/centre communication diary</li>
<li>offering opportunities for parents and wh&#257;nau to take part in centre programmes</li>
<li>including and celebrating events in children&rsquo;s lives outside the centre</li>
<li>using good practices to support the transition of children into and out of the centre.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Review of indoor learning environment. Through centre-wide self review, teachers continue to make improvements to the learning environment. They have created spacious surroundings where children have ongoing access to discrete play areas that facilitate independent choice. Displays that reflect previous learning experiences provide parents with useful information and enable children to revisit their learning.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Strengthening planning and assessment practices. Teachers should continue to refine the practices they use for planning and assessment. ERO has identified the following next steps to help in making these improvements:</p><ul>
<li>writing learning stories that emphasise individual children&rsquo;s interests and strengths and reflect their voice</li>
<li>ensuring that programme evaluations include teachers&rsquo; critical reflection on their own professional practice</li>
<li>documenting the strategies that teachers could use to support children&rsquo;s interest-based individual learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Interactions that extend learning. Teachers could increase their focus on interactions that challenge children to problem solve and to develop independent thinking in their play. To further extend children&rsquo;s learning, teachers could make greater use of openended questions to develop children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning skills.</p><p align="left">Learning environments. There is a need to make further improvements to the learning environment to support children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers need to consider how the indoor learning areas can be made more inviting for children&rsquo;s exploration and discovery. Centre managers have also identified the need to improve the physical layout of the outdoor environment to enable better supervision and a greater range of activities.</p><h3>The Quality of Centre Management</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">As this is the first ERO review of Coastal Kids Preschool since the centre opened in 2009, aspects of centre management were evaluated.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Professional support. The centre manager is well supported by the national Kidicorp organisation to fulfil her management and curriculum roles. Systems, processes and practices across the centre, including monitoring of compliance with health and safety requirements, are implemented consistently.</p><p align="left">Centre improvement. Regular self-review processes result in ongoing improvements in the services the centre provides. Self review is well documented and opportunities are provided for parent involvement in the process. Parents&rsquo; contributions are valued by managers and teachers.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Greater use of self review. The centre manager continues to refine the centre&rsquo;s selfreview practices. Next steps to consider include:</p><ul>
<li>providing opportunities for children to contribute to the evaluation of centre practices</li>
<li>using self review to inform the development of centre&rsquo;s strategic and annual plans.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre has experience in providing for children with special learning needs. Staff work with support agencies to develop good practices. The indoor physical environment is spacious and provides children with easy access to the outdoor area.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Knowing the child. Children benefit from teachers&rsquo; ongoing commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all learners. A primary care giver is allocated to a child with special needs and time is taken by staff to build trusting and respectful relationships with the child&rsquo;s family. Staff use appropriate resources and strategies to enable all children to engage in a variety of learning experiences. There is positive focus on children&rsquo;s strengths and capabilities.</p><p align="left">Use of external agencies. Good use is made of external agencies and personnel to support students with special needs. The input from external agencies provides further professional development for staff and a wider field of expertise to support children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre managers have appropriately identified the following areas as priorities for developing staff skills in including children with special needs in the programme:</p><ul>
<li>recording the processes of and outcomes resulting from self review</li>
<li>providing cross-cultural training where appropriate to support staff to respond to the children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Coastal Kids - Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-coastal-kids-preschool" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Coastal Kids - Preschool</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Coastal Kids - Preschool.</p><p align="left">Coastal Kids Preschool, located in coastal Beachlands, Auckland, provides care and education for children from two years of age. The centre name and ownership changed in 2009. This is ERO&rsquo;s first review of the centre under its new ownership. The nearby Coastal Kids centre caters for children from three months to five years of age. Both centres operate under the umbrella of the national Kidicorp Organisation.</p><p align="left">A caring and inclusive culture is evident in the centre. Adult interactions with children are warm and friendly. Children&rsquo;s interests form the basis of programme plans. The centre is inclusive of children with special learning needs. Children confidently initiate conversations with adults and each other. Teachers value good communication with parents and wh&#257;nau. Children and parents are familiar with the people and resources in the centre and their sense of belonging in the centre is clearly evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers affirm children&rsquo;s play and invite their involvement in a variety of learning experiences. Children are well supported to develop literacy skills in ways that are appropriate to their age level. Teachers incorporate M&#257;ori language and bicultural perspectives into their teaching practice and the centre environment. There is a need for teachers to further develop programme planning and assessment and to increase their focus on interactions that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers continue to make improvements to the learning environment. Resources are accessible to children so that they can make independent choices. Children have easy access to the outdoor area. The centre manager has identified the need to continue to make improvements that support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">The centre is well managed. The Kidicorp organisation has established a framework of administrative, personnel and support systems to underpin centre operations. The centre manager is developing an effective teaching team. Good self-review systems are in place to help the centre to continue to develop in positive ways.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
