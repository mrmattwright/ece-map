</table><p>Rolleston Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rolleston Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative with parents encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and management.</p><p>Rolleston Playcentre operates four morning sessions and one 'Babies can Play' session a week. It has a full roll and a high level of parent involvement, particularly in the parent education programme. Local community groups regularly undertake projects to improve learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The centre is making good progress in meeting the recommendations in the 2012 ERO report. Parents identify children's learning and include some ways that adults can help children build on their learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster review of nine playcentres in the Canterbury Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are fully engaged in all aspects of the playcentre programme and operations. Children confidently make decisions about the programme and their learning. They regularly take part with parents in health and safety checks and session preparations. Parents make very good use of succession planning and have clear, well-documented systems and practices to continually increase their skills and confidence within the playcentre.</p><p>Children are deeply involved and willing to take risks to extend their learning. They enjoy a wide range of experiences and are well supported by parents who join in their play and encourage them to experiment and solve problems.</p><p>Children and families benefit from a welcoming and inclusive culture. Clear, well-organised support and information is given to new families to help them quickly settle in, and fully participate in the playcentre. Parents' skills are valued and well used to support children's learning and manage the centre. Children play well together and are empowered to be leaders, particularly older children including younger children in their play.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' wellbeing and learning are well supported by all parents. The infant area is well resourced and inviting for children and parents. Toddlers confidently explore the wide range of activities available under the careful guidance of parents and older children.</p><p>MƒÅori values are becoming well integrated throughout the programme. Parents are increasingly recognising MƒÅori perspectives in learning, resources and displays. Parents who have developed knowledge in te ao MƒÅori through participation in the playcentre parent education programme are leading these aspects of the programme.</p><p>Children's learning assessment and planning clearly identify children's interests and learning progress. Parents make good use of their knowledge of their children to link home and centre learning, and to extend the learning of others. The progression of a number of parents through the parent training courses is ensuring that all parents are well supported to develop a knowledge of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and participate confidently in assessment and planning.</p><p>The parents have a strong focus on continuous improvement and building management capability. They have developed some useful internal evaluation processes, particularly for improving the environment to support children's learning. The strategic plan is appropriately linked to the association goals and areas for development for this centre. Parents regularly monitor their progress to achieve the centre's goals.</p><p>The Canterbury Playcentre Association has made significant progress since the 2014 ERO cluster review. They have implemented a strategic plan that effectively identifies goals, plans and progress. The centre support and education teams have been structured to provide more efficient and timely support and guidance for the centres. The parent education programme has become more accessible to parents. Noticeably more parents are participating in all levels of the training and are making good use of this new knowledge in the centres. The centre support team is successfully facilitating the sharing of useful knowledge and practices across centres.</p><p>The association has high expectations for every child to experience high quality education and all parents actively involved in parent education and the management of the centres. They have established some very useful systems and practices to ensure the sustainability and improvement of the organisation and the centres. This includes effective evaluation and monitoring of the quality of education for parents and improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The key next steps for the association are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review how well the individual playcentre philosophies are meeting the changing contexts of centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement appraisals for the members of the centre support team to align more closely with centre needs and association expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association, parents and ERO agree that the next key steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment and planning by focusing more on the ways that adults support teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending internal evaluation to focus more on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing te ao MƒÅori in the programme with particular emphasis on MƒÅori children experiencing success as MƒÅori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rolleston Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the association needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal for members of the Education Support Team.</p>
</li>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
