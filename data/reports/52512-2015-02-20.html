</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eden Christian Kindergarten is a non profit, community based Kindergarten. The centre is licensed to provide both sessional and all-day education and care for up to 47 children. Although the centre is licensed to cater for a small group of children up to two years old this aspect of the license is unused. A playgroup operates on Friday where children aged up to two years attend with a parent or caregiver.</p><p>A governance board, made up of representatives from local churches and the Parents‚Äô Group, oversees the centre‚Äôs special character and strategic developments. A manager and head teacher lead day-to-day operations. The teaching team is experienced and well-established.</p><p>The centre philosophy is the cornerstone for operations and practice. It acknowledges Christian values within a nurturing environment to help children grow a strong foundation for life. There is a strong emphasis on celebrating culture and diversity and the uniqueness of each child.</p><p>Since the March 2012 ERO report, developments to the spacious and well-resourced environment have further enhanced children‚Äôs exploration and learning.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enthusiastically participate in a curriculum that is both child and teacher initiated. Teachers are responsive, attuned and sensitive to the variety of ways children express and explore their working theories. Adults engage well with young learners to listen to their views and promote their sustained interest in play and learning. Children are confident, cooperative and settled.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths, ideas and weekly evaluations. Well-presented portfolios highlight children‚Äôs engagement in learning and their developing friendships. Assessment focuses on dispositional learning and shows the continuity of children‚Äôs sustained interests. Leaders and teachers should investigate ways to further strengthen assessment practice.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are carefully planned and implemented in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau. Teachers are building relationships with local schools to support children as they move on to school. Teachers make links between <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and the key competencies in <em>The¬†New¬†Zealand Curriculum</em>. Children gain literacy, numeracy and science concepts appropriately within the context of play and at group times.</p><p>Teachers express a commitment to continued improvement of their practice of te reo MƒÅori and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. They have established relationships with local iwi and marae. Children are developing a growing awareness of Aotearoa New Zealand's dual cultural heritage.</p><p>Inclusive practice is very evident. All teachers acknowledge children‚Äôs different cultures, skills, interests and ways of learning.</p><p>A positive, collaborative and professional teaching team culture is evident. The head teacher provides sound leadership. Teachers are empowered to take responsibility for curriculum design, review and development. Leaders and teachers have identified that further refining appraisal practice should help build teacher capability.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and parents are consulted and have opportunities to contribute to self review. The philosophy and vision of the centre is influenced by the aspirations of parents and churches.</p><p>The dual purposes of self review for improvement and accountability are well understood. Self review is ongoing and responsive to identified priorities. It focuses on the effectiveness of operation and practice. Leaders have identified the need to continue to build their evaluative capability to better inform decision making. Developing indicators to monitor progress in achieving intended outcomes is a useful next step.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs strategic direction is strongly linked to positive outcomes for children and guides the service to attain its vision and goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders value continual improvement and have identified the following priorities which ERO's external evaluation confirms as appropriate and timely:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meaningful indicators for self review to guide their evaluation of the impact of practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management, to identify and support best professional teaching, reflecting <em>TƒÅtaiako</em>: <em>Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> and how the competencies might further inform appraisal and attestation against the New Zealand Teachers Council Registered Teacher Criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eden Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Eden Christian Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central 20 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
