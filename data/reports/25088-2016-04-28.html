</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Falemaama Preschool is part of the Vai 'O e Mo'ui Church in Henderson, West Auckland and operates under the national synod of the Methodist Church of New Zealand, Vahefonua Tonga O Aotearoa. Included under the national synod is the Auckland Manukau Tongan Methodist Parish, who is the appointed service provider for Akoteu Falemaama Preschool as well as six other Tongan centres. Positive relationships and strong links between the church, community and preschool are evident.</p><p>Akoteu Falemaama literally translates as the "house of light" and aims to offer children and families a safe, nurturing and stimulating educational environment to grow and learn. Tongan language and culture are the basis for the curriculum.</p><p>The community-based preschool offers full day care and education and can cater for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Two qualified teachers are well supported by other staff in training or in support roles.</p><p>The preschool is governed by a board of trustees consisting of church and community members, parents, the centre manager and the service provider. A well implemented action plan helped the board and centre leaders respond to the areas for development identified by ERO during the 2011 review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children make independent choices about their play and enjoy exploring with and alongside each other. Their play flows well between the indoor and outdoor spaces. The programme is now more child led. Mat times and meal routines are responsive to children's preferences and level of engagement.</p><p>Children are confident and take a lead role in cultural routines such as lotu. They readily offer suggestions and choices for mat time songs and activities. Children are familiar with the range of languages used at mat time, and move easily between Tongan, English and te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>The attractive and spacious centre environment is respected by children and adults. Significant and successful review of, and input into, the presentation of play areas invites children to participate and explore. Tongan themes and decor provides children with familiar and relevant resources. The designated area for children up to two years is well used to give the youngest children time together in their own space. At other times, they are well supported by teachers as they play happily alongside older children.</p><p>The curriculum is very responsive to children and reflects the preschool philosophy to immerse children in the Tongan culture. Teachers' focus on literacy and numeracy learning is also well reflected in wall displays and resources. Children's lunch boxes reflect teachers' successful promotion of healthy eating with families.</p><p>Staff work well together and are affectionate and caring towards children. They consistently use Tongan language in their interactions with children. Teachers have begun to plan the programme in response to what they notice about the interests of children. Teachers should use what they know about these interests to extend children's play and thinking through better use of their interactions with children. They also need to consider how they can better document children's learning over time.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to embed what they have learnt from the wide range of professional learning they have undertaken over several years. The board is providing external mentoring support for them to do this. Personnel policies and practices to support staff development are in place.</p><p>Good management and governance systems provide a sound base to guide the preschool's operation. The board of trustees have good oversight and are committed supporters of the preschool. Priorities from the recently developed strategic plan now need to be determined and planned for annually.</p><p>The establishment of very useful centre evaluation practices are resulting in positive changes. The shared leadership of regular and emergent review is growing collaborative practice. Teachers are using good questions to guide review and are seeking input from the centre community</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members of the board and centre leaders agree with ERO that next steps for the preschool include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using mentoring support for staff to embed new practices and build leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>holding regular appraisal meetings with staff and updating the appraisal process to include Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing an in-committee process for board meetings and ensuring that in-committee minutes are kept securely.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Falemaama Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Falemaama Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
