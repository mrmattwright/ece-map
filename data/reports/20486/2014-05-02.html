</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>All Saints Church Community Crèche shares a site with the All Saints Anglican Church in Ponsonby, Auckland. The crèche provides good quality sessional education and care for children between 18 months and five years of age. Families enjoy long-standing relationships with the crèche.</p><p>The crèche is managed and supported by a licensee and management committee consisting of parents and the supervisor. A stable teaching team share the leadership of the crèche and work together in respectful and supportive ways with the goal of providing a high quality child care centre that meets the needs of the community.</p><p>ERO’s 2011 report recommended that committee members and staff continue to develop self review to make ongoing improvements that support positive outcomes for children. While improvements have occurred, the committee now needs to make self review more robust and to more fully document their review process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service reflects the intentions of the centre philosophy to provide a warm and welcoming learning environment where teachers are responsive to families/whānau and the needs and individuality of children.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging. They are confident communicators who regularly talk about their play. Children explore the attractive, spacious, well organised learning environment and participate in activities of interest to them.</p><p>The experienced teaching team know children very well and are consistently available to support children’s play. Teachers listen to children, encourage them to be involved in activities and affirm children’s thinking. They provide activities which promote the development of language learning and numeracy skills and a love of art, storytelling, and creative play.</p><p>Children are well supported to learn ways to interact positively with each other and to manage their relationships with others effectively. Building social competence is highlighted as a key learning disposition.</p><p>Programme planning is effective. Teachers record children’s interests and plan for subsequent learning. Children’s participation in programme activities is attractively documented in their individual records of learning. Parents respond to their children’s learning by contributing to their portfolios and participating actively in a learning partnership with teachers. Teachers are currently considering the changes they need to make to the programme to meet the strengths and developmental needs of children now that the majority of children are three years and under.</p><p>The management committee, made up of interested parents and church representatives, is supportive of the teaching team. A new committee chairperson is about to be inducted. Systems for governance and management should continue to be strengthened to ensure that the centre fully meets its mandatory requirements and is focused on ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to strengthen sustainability and succession planning the teaching team and management committee need to:</p><ul>
<li>review and further develop the centre’s strategic plan to include curriculum goals</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes and documentation</li>
<li>document reviews of curriculum and operational progress aligned to the strategic plan and report findings of these reviews in ways that will help inform future decision making.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that the centre seek professional learning and development to address these key next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of All Saints Church Community Crèche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. To support ongoing improvement in current practices the management committee and staff should review and refine the centre’s policy base and related procedures to provide better guidance for teachers.</p><p>During the review ERO also identified an area of non-compliance. To address this, the licensee must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>teachers’ performance is regularly appraised <em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of All Saints Church Community Crèche will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
