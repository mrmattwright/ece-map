</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Port Ahuriri Playcentre is situated in Napier. It operates three morning sessions a week catering for 23 children including up to 13 children aged under two years. Many families have joined the centre since 2015 bringing their cultural expertise and diverse skills to contribute to children's experiences in the programme.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on empowering children and families to work, play and learn together. Educating parents and strengthening whƒÅnau to enable them to meet the learning needs of the children is a high priority for centre members. Teaching children about how to care for the environment is a feature of the programme.</p><p>Since the February 2014 ERO report there has been considerable progress towards addressing important areas for development and review. A core group of parents has led developments in improving playcentre systems and processes. Supporting them have been key people from the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association and external professional development providers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs interests and learning are well supported by parent educators. Children confidently make choices and show a sense of curiosity. Relationships are warm and encouraging which assists children and families sense of belonging. Adults foster children's independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Children are actively involved in their play with and alongside others. Adults make good use of interactions with children to make links between the playcentre, home and community. Infants' and toddlers' wellbeing is supported through unhurried routines and purposeful resourcing. Musical experiences and science activities feature as part of each session.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to learn about healthy eating, and physical activity.</p><p>A recently introduced 'buddy' system helps new families transition into the playcentre and learn about centre expectations. Adults are responsive to families' needs during the move to school.</p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about te ao MƒÅori. Professional development has assisted adults to build their understanding. Adults acknowledge that learning and practices are not yet embedded and further development is needed.</p><p>Considerable progress in understanding the purpose and use of assessment and planning has been made. Sound processes guide adults to notice, recognise and respond to children's learning. Members are committed to ongoing improvement and deepening these systems.</p><p>Self review continues to develop and is used to inquire into centre practices and policies.</p><p>Leadership is collective, cooperative and utilises the strengths of members. New information and training is shared with all families to strengthen the programme. Continuing to build consistency and understanding of playcentre approaches remains an ongoing focus.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members, the association and ERO agree that continuing to embed the following processes should improve outcomes for all children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review and internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Port Ahuriri Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Port Ahuriri Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>31 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>
