<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p><strong>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</strong></p>
<p>Whenuakite Country Kids is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children, who are well cared for and enjoy carefully planned, interesting experiences.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Whenuakite Country Kids is a rural, all day education and care service near Whitianga catering for children up to the age of five. The centre is community based and is licensed for 35 children, including eight under two. The purpose-built facilities are well maintained and provide spacious indoor and outdoor environments for children‚Äôs play and exploration.</p>
<p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy, which aims to develop strong and ongoing relationships with children and whƒÅnau, is well met. The centre is an integral part of the wide, but close community it serves. A current policy framework guides the centre and robust processes are resulting in effective self review, focussed on improvement.</p>
<p>Since the last ERO review in 2009, a new centre manager and administrator have been appointed. The centre manager has a clear vision of desired best practice and within the last year the centre has made a good response to areas for improvement suggested in the 2009 report. One of the main outcomes of recent self review has been a more child-centred approach to programme planning, activities for children, and to teaching practice. Children have more opportunities to lead and manage their learning and staff have undertaken professional development in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p>
<p>The centre manager and teachers continue to work collaboratively to sustain high-quality teaching and learning.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Children learn in an attractive, inviting environment that includes displays that celebrate their learning and interests. Teachers have warm, respectful relationships with children and focus on their holistic development. Centre-wide and individualised programmes are based on children‚Äôs interests, encouraging their independence, creativity and safe risk-taking. Parents are able to contribute to the daily programme and teachers are responsive to their input. Children and parents appreciate revisiting learning experiences through attractively presented portfolios.</p>
<p>ERO observed children engaged in sustained, purposeful play and exploration. They enjoy a wide range of interesting activities that promote their thinking and provide physical challenges. Teachers support and extend them through meaningful learning conversations. Leaders and teachers are responsive in providing equipment and materials, both existing and new. Information and communication technology equipment and resources are used to enrich and extend learning, and leaders recognise the need for further development in this area. Children have many opportunities to use and explore literacy and mathematics as part of everyday activities. They are confident in requesting support, guidance and resources to meet their needs and in undertaking leadership roles.</p>
<p>Children under two are warmly nurtured in a relaxed environment. Routines are flexible in response to their changing needs. Infants and toddlers are well supported through appropriate child initiated and teacher facilitated learning opportunities, encouraging both group and individual play and exploration. Their communication and social skills are fostered in meaningful contexts.</p>
<p>A recent review of transition practices within and from the centre has brought about a more carefully managed process focused on individual children and their family‚Äôs needs. The centre enjoys close links with the nearby primary school.</p>
<p>Teachers are increasingly using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. They recognise the need to further develop their understanding of Te Ao MƒÅori and success for MƒÅori, as MƒÅori.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>ERO and centre leaders agree that there is a need to strengthen:</p>
<ul><li>the centre‚Äôs strategic planning process, by incorporating input from all stakeholders, reviewing the philosophy, linking all centre practices to the plan and monitoring progress regularly</li>
<li>appraisal processes, by linking teachers‚Äô goals to the strategic plan and professional development, including teacher reflections and incorporating ongoing observations of teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>It would also be beneficial to continue to improve planning and assessment, with increased emphasis on children‚Äôs learning dispositions, including MƒÅori dispositions, within the context of their interests and activities.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whenuakite Country Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. To address this, centre leaders must:</p>
<ul><li>document the centre selection and appointment procedures.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres, 2008, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
