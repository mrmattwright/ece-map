</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parua Bay Playcentre is a well established centre that operates as a parent cooperative. Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre is situated on the edge of the local school grounds. It is open four days a week and includes a transition session for children in preparation for the local kindergarten.</p><p>Since the 2013 review the centre has gone through a significant change in membership. Most families are new to the centre and have willingly taken on leadership roles. Housing development in the area has led to many new families becoming involved in this community of learners. Many centre members have completed Course 1 and are moving onto Course 2 of the Playcentre adult education programme.</p><p>The centre is part of the Northland Playcentre Association. The Association is the umbrella organisation for 22 centres in Northland, many of which are semi-rural. The Association provides systems to help members manage their centres and support their children's learning. It also provides adult education programmes for Playcentre qualifications. As part of a current Playcentre Aotearoa national restructure there will be a new regional manager and new centre support roles.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Northern Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play confidently together. They choose where they want to play and are comfortable to ask adults for more resources. Adults have a strong understanding about child-initiated learning through play.</p><p>Adults focus on extending oral language as they play and have natural conversations with children. There is a good sense of adults looking after and working with each other's children. Parents/whānau recognise the need to work collaboratively for a common purpose of fostering children's learning through play.</p><p>Centre members have built up and continue to add to a stock of very good resources. They have thoughtfully arranged resources and equipment so that children can readily access it for use in their play.</p><p>This relatively new group of parents/whānau are accepting, inclusive and welcoming towards each other and their children. They see themselves as starting out as a new group together and support each other's needs.</p><p>Centre members are developing internal evaluation systems so that they can make informed decisions about areas that need improvement. A recent review of individual children's portfolios has resulted in adaptions being made. Resources are at hand to support parents/whānau in their processes for recording children's learning.</p><p>Committee members are committed to the success of the centre. They are clear about their roles and welcome other members to join them as they feel ready. Committee members appreciate the support they have received from the Association. More experienced centre members support others to develop their roles as educators. Continuing education and training for all parents is an ongoing priority.</p><p>The Association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the efficient operation of Playcentres. They actively foster emergent leadership to sustain the Association and centre viability. The Association provides good support to help Playcentres remain well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified relevant key next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen bicultural practices in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing strategic and annual plans for the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To help strengthen operations in all Northland centres, new regional support personnel should consider ways to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>determine the best strategies to encourage centre members to take greater responsibility for all aspects of centre operations, including assessment, programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to increase emphasis on and financial support for the Kaiāwhina role in supporting centre members' bicultural understanding and proficiency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen members' understanding of the need for succession planning and close alignment between strategic and annual plans for ongoing improvement, as well as operational plans for day-to-day management and maintenance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support centre members to recognise their role as facilitators of children's learning, social competence and independence. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parua Bay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parua Bay Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Steffan Brough</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>15 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
