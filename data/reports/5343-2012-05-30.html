<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Brian Webb Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Adult&rsquo;s good quality interactions actively support children&rsquo;s play. Children arrive at kindergarten with a sense of purpose and quickly settle in their areas of self-selected play. They are encouraged to play cooperatively and to be inclusive of each other.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate respectful, reciprocal and responsive relationships with children, families and with each other. Teachers regard their strong family relationships as a feature of the kindergarten and they value the ongoing input and support they receive from wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The programme actively supports children as independent, confident, competent learners. The well-considered team philosophy reflects the team&rsquo;s beliefs about children&rsquo;s learning and is enacted through the curriculum. Programme planning is flexible and responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging and developing interests. Aspects of literacy and mathematics are well integrated. Children are highly engaged and confident to express themselves orally and creatively.</p><p>Learning stories show progress with relationship-building and children's participation in the programme. They include a variety of perspectives including those of parents. Through this, good links are being established between the kindergarten programme and children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Effective strategies and resources are in place to support children&rsquo;s transition to primary school and to assist transition within the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate an understanding of the different stages of a sound improvement focussed self-review process. Teachers are developing an awareness of the difference between planning for development and reviewing to determine quality. The next step is to deepen analysis of data.</p><p>Teachers show a commitment to developing bicultural practices. Their confidence needs supporting to more readily incorporate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the day-to-day programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Brian Webb Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBrian Webb Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The kindergarten has a sound reporting history with ERO, and the May 2008 ERO review found that the programme was responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, and that children&rsquo;s independence and early literacy and social skills were fostered through skilful interactions. Since then the kindergarten has been refurbished, plans for further development have been drawn up and parental feedback is currently being sought.</p><p>Teachers have been supported by the senior teacher team.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Interactions</h5><p>Good quality interactions between adults and children responsively support children&rsquo;s play. Children arrive at kindergarten with a sense of purpose and quickly settle in their areas of self-selected play. They are encouraged to play cooperatively and to be inclusive of each other.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate respectful, reciprocal and responsive relationships with children, families and with each other. They model their consistent and clear high expectations.</p><p>Adult&rsquo;s sound questioning extends children&rsquo;s play and promotes problem solving. Children demonstrate independence. They confidently take learning risks and experiment through trial and error. Children are enthusiastic learners.</p><h5>Programme</h5><p>Planning is flexible and responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging and developing interests. Children are highly engaged. Their creative expression is fostered and they confidently express themselves. Aspects of literacy and mathematics are well integrated.</p><p>The programme actively supports children as independent, confident, competent learners. The well-considered team philosophy reflects the team&rsquo;s beliefs and is enacted through the curriculum.</p><p>Routines are well managed. A high level of consistency across the team has been developed through regular sharing of ideas and strategies. Communication between adults associated with each child&rsquo;s learning is given high priority.</p><h5>Portfolios</h5><p>Learning stories show children&rsquo;s progress with relationship-building and settling and their participation in the programme. Transitions are very well recorded in the children&rsquo;s profile books. The focus on learning dispositions is coming through in the learning stories. They include a variety of perspectives, including those of parents. Through this, good links are being established between the kindergarten programme and children&rsquo;s lives.</p><h5>Bicultural practices</h5><p>Bicultural practices are evident in the environment and are effectively supported as children transition from the afternoon to the morning programme when each one is welcomed with a powhiri. Children are familiar with a range of waiata.</p><p>Profiles of M&#257;ori children acknowledge their culture. Inclusiveness is evident and the environment reflects elements of M&#257;ori culture. Teachers are reviewing how well they are enacting their philosophy statement on te ao M&#257;ori.</p><h5>Environment</h5><p>The well-resourced learning environment is thoughtfully set out to cater for children&rsquo;s wide-ranging interests. Outdoor spaces include a sensory play section, a variety of small gardens as well as areas that promote physical challenge. There is good integration of natural materials among the resources.</p><p>Children use the whole of the environment. They demonstrate knowledge of the resources available and use these to support their imaginative play and constructions.</p><p>Teachers collaborate to promote a calm and supportive emotional environment that promotes each child&rsquo;s sense of belonging and well-being.</p><h5>Self review</h5><p>Teachers demonstrate a greater understanding of the different stages of a sound self review process. It is improvement focused and there is regular reflection and informal discussion as they work through the process. A range of data informs decision making.</p><h5>Transition</h5><p>Effective strategies and resources support children&rsquo;s transition to primary school and to assist transition within the kindergarten. They are involved in a local area cluster where early childhood and new entrant teachers work together to support transition processes and understandings.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Bicultural practices</h5><p>Teachers show a commitment to developing their practices, however their confidence needs supporting in order for them to more readily incorporate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the day-to-day programme.</p><h5>Self review</h5><p>Teachers are developing an awareness of the difference between development planning and reviewing to determine quality. While teachers collate data their next step is to analyse data more thoroughly. Spontaneous reviews are yet to be consistently evidence-based rather than relying on shared professional knowledge. These would benefit from being revisited to determine the effectiveness of the changes over time.</p><h5>Assessment</h5><p>Teachers use of assessment information varies. Profiles do not always show links between learning stories to demonstrate how teachers have added complexity to children&rsquo;s learning. More consideration needs to be given to including possible next steps to these documents.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-brian-webb-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Brian Webb Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Brian Webb Kindergarten.</p><p>Brian Webb Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Adult&rsquo;s good quality interactions actively support children&rsquo;s play. Children arrive at kindergarten with a sense of purpose and quickly settle in their areas of self-selected play. They are encouraged to play cooperatively and to be inclusive of each other.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate respectful, reciprocal and responsive relationships with children, families and with each other. Teachers regard their strong family relationships as a feature of the kindergarten and they value the ongoing input and support they receive from wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The programme actively supports children as independent, confident, competent learners. The well-considered team philosophy reflects the team&rsquo;s beliefs about children&rsquo;s learning and is enacted through the curriculum. Programme planning is flexible and responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging and developing interests. Aspects of literacy and mathematics are well integrated. Children are highly engaged and confident to express themselves orally and creatively.</p><p>Learning stories show progress with relationship-building and children's participation in the programme. They include a variety of perspectives including those of parents. Through this, good links are being established between the kindergarten programme and children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Effective strategies and resources are in place to support children&rsquo;s transition to primary school and to assist transition within the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate an understanding of the different stages of a sound improvement focussed self-review process. Teachers are developing an awareness of the difference between planning for development and reviewing to determine quality. The next step is to deepen analysis of data.</p><p>Teachers show a commitment to developing bicultural practices. Their confidence needs supporting to more readily incorporate te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the day-to-day programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Acting National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
