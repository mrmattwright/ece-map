The service was recently relicensed and now includes education and care for children up to two years. This supplementary review focuses primarily on the learning area which caters for children aged two and over. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>teaching interactions</li>
<li>assessment and planning</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>strategic planning</li>
<li>engagement with parents and wh&#257;nau, including in assessment processes</li>

</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Jack and Jill Kindergarten in Wainuiomata provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Its licence was recently extended to include children under two years of age. These younger children learn and play in a separate building. Several new staff have been employed by the service since the October 2011 ERO report.</p><p>This supplementary report is in response to the previous ERO report, and focuses on the provision of education and care for children aged two years and older. This review evaluates the progress made in addressing the areas identified for improvement as outlined in the terms of reference.</p><p>Following the previous report the licensee and senior teachers attended an ERO post-review assistance workshop and developed an action plan to address the recommendations of the ERO report. This action plan has become a useful foundation for developments that have taken place over the past year.</p><p>Good progress has been made in all areas. Under the head teacher&rsquo;s leadership, teachers have worked collaboratively to review and modify assessment and planning practices. Processes and guidelines are now in place which support teachers to notice and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and to reflect on future changes to the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have introduced a range of strategies which effectively increase parent and wh&#257;nau engagement and partnership.</p><p>Review and development focused on teaching practices that promote children&rsquo;s social skills and independence have had a positive impact. Children are supported to interact respectfully with one another. Leaders have a sound process for self review and continued use and refinement of this model should help all teachers to develop their understandings of effective self review.</p><p>ERO and managers agree that a priority for continued development is to explore how assessment and teaching interactions can further extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Programme planning and assessment</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s October 2011 report noted that there was a need to improve the quality of programme planning and assessment.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Processes and guidelines are in place that support improved assessment and planning practices. Under the head teacher&rsquo;s leadership, teachers work collaboratively to review and modify assessment and planning processes. Children&rsquo;s portfolios show that teachers often notice and respond well to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers reflect on programme planning and ensure that individual and group interests are used to inform teaching, including appropriate integration of children&rsquo;s interests and literacy learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have introduced a range of strategies that effectively increase parent and wh&#257;nau engagement and partnership. They are continuing to explore ways to promote more wh&#257;nau input into children&rsquo;s assessment.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Although some progress has been made with children&rsquo;s portfolios, learning stories do not consistently recognise children&rsquo;s significant learning. There is a need for continued professional development so that teachers can recognise and respond more effectively to extend children&rsquo;s deeper learning and clearly identify appropriate next learning steps. Guidance for teachers should include increased focus on recognition of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Teaching and learning interactions</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>In 2011, ERO recommended that teachers develop teaching strategies which add depth and complexity to their learning. They noted that teachers needed to foster children&rsquo;s competence and encourage their independence.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Leaders and teachers have engaged in significant review and development focused on developing children&rsquo;s social competencies and independence. The impact of this is evident. Teachers model respectful interactions and positively encourage children to interact appropriately. They are gentle, nurturing and affirming but demonstrate high expectations for how children should interact. Children generally have positive and respectful relationships. There are opportunities for children to make decisions about aspects of their daily activities and to take leadership roles.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Teachers should engage in professional learning and development to further their knowledge and practice about interactions that extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Conversations should promote problem-solving, creativity and deeper learning.</p><h3>Strategic planning and self review</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous report noted the need for a strategic plan for the centre that reflects the vision of staff, wh&#257;nau and children. It stated that professional learning should be embedded in self review and that ongoing self review was likely to assist the service to improve outcomes for children.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Strategic and annual plans guide the work of managers and teachers. The action plan put in place following the previous review has become a useful, working document. It forms the basis for teacher reflection and discussion and is used to effectively support programme development over the last year.</p><p>A sound process for self review has been established. This has helped teachers to clearly identify areas for improvement and consequently improve their practice.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>ERO and managers agree that it is timely to consult with parents, wh&#257;nau and teachers in order to inform a centre vision document and new strategic plan. ERO recommends that managers and teachers align action planning and self review with strategic and annual planning, and the centre vision.</p><p>The use of self review as a tool to evaluate further aspects of teaching and learning should help staff to better understand the process and inform wh&#257;nau, management and teachers about the quality of the programme for children.</p><h3>Actions required to meet legal requirements</h3><p>The compliance issues identified in the 2011 ERO report have been addressed.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Acting National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>20 February 2013</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

Processes and guidelines are now in place which support teachers to notice and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and to reflect on future changes to the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have introduced a range of strategies which effectively increase parent and wh&#257;nau engagement and partnership.</p><p>Review and development focused on teaching practices that promote children&rsquo;s social skills and independence have had a positive impact. Children are supported to interact respectfully with one another. Leaders have a sound process for self review and continued use and refinement of this model should help all teachers to develop their understandings of effective self review.</p><p>ERO and managers agree that a priority for continued development is to explore how assessment and teaching interactions can further extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p></html>
