</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frankton Kindergarten, is located in the suburb of Frankton in Hamilton, and is licensed for 47 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children aged two years old to school age. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is an additional language. At the time of this ERO review 54 children were enrolled, including 24 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòOur children are strong in heart, head and hand‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Cultural advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumƒÅtua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‚ÄòCool for School‚Äô transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato Under 5 Energise. The kindergartens‚Äô education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on establishing and maintaining warm and trusting relationships between kaiako, tamariki and whƒÅnau and providing a strong sense of belonging for children. The kindergarten believes in the importance of play and nurturing children to develop social competency in a physically and emotionally safe environment. Priority is placed on embracing bicultural values, traditions and language, as well as celebrating cultural diversity with the community.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014, there have been significant changes to the teaching team. A new head teacher was appointed in 2017 and there are also three new teachers. The kindergarten has responded well to the areas identified in the previous report. The WKA has also undertaken an extensive redevelopment of the outdoor play area.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the WKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is highly inclusive and responsive. Children with additional learning and behavioural needs are well identified and supported through ongoing individualised planning and external support. The language, culture and identity of MƒÅori and other diverse groups are highly visible and prioritised in planning and assessment. Children experience a sense of belonging and connection to their cultural heritage. A personalised approach to transitions into and out of the kindergarten contributes to success for children. The curriculum has a strong focus on literacy and mathematics and is enriched through a wide range of meaningful and authentic contexts, including environmental education, trips into the local community and visitors to the kindergarten. Children have extensive opportunities to lead their own learning, exercise choice and problem solve.</p><p>Relationships between teachers, children and their families are affirming, sensitive and respectful. Teachers deliberately develop children‚Äôs skills for social competence and skilfully use positive guidance strategies to support children's learning and behaviour. Parents' views and aspirations for their children are gathered and used effectively in individualised planning and assessment. Positive partnerships for learning are enhanced through the effective sharing of children‚Äôs learning progress and the involvement of parents, families and whƒÅnau in kindergarten activities. The learning environments are attractive and well resourced, with many deliberate provocations that promote positive learning outcomes. Children experience a sense of belonging and wellbeing in a family-based environment.</p><p>Highly-collaborative leadership is focused on building teacher capability. The head teacher has established a positive team culture with a shared vision for the kindergarten and high levels of trust. Relationships with parents, families, whƒÅnau and community have been strengthened through a strategic approach to communication and consultation. Leadership has enhanced bicultural practices in the kindergarten through involvement with the local marae and kaumƒÅtua. Internal evaluation is used effectively to inform changes to practice and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The WKA provides sound, comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Education services managers work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operations. Effective governance by WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree the next steps for this kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formalise the kindergarten‚Äôs local curriculum in consultation with parents, whƒÅnau and local community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to refine the planning and assessment process to ensure consistency of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frankton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frankton Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>26 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
