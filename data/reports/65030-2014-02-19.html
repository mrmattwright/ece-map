</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Woodend Preschool and Nursery is a privately owned early childhood service providing care and education for children from birth to five years old. It is located in the township of Woodend in North Canterbury. The managers and teachers maintain close links with the local community and school, which is directly across the road.</p><p>The centre is well established and has a stable staff. A new management structure had been introduced just prior to ERO's visit. This includes a business manager position to promote consistency of best practice across the four centres owned by the same managers.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the indoor preschool and nursery areas have been extended and redecorated. Changes made to the outdoor area allow more flexible use of spaces. Teachers have had some professional development to support understandings of bicultural practices. Parents are well informed about children’s interests and involvement in the centre programme. Teachers provide attractive and informative individual profile books that encourage children and parents to revisit special events.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers focus strongly on building positive relationships with children and families. They actively promote partnerships with parents to support children’s learning. Managers and teachers highly value and make good use of parents' views, and their contribution to children’s learning and the future direction of the centre.</p><p>Teachers foster an inclusive learning environment for children that helps support their sense of belonging. ERO observed that children are treated with dignity and respect by teachers. Teachers encourage children to make decisions independently.</p><p>Children initiate interactions with adults, confident that their interests will be responded to. They play well with and alongside others and develop friendships. Teachers and children enjoy one another’s company and have fun together.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their interests in literacy, music, physical and creative experiences in a well-organised learning environment. Visitors to the centre and children’s visits into the community enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>Teachers work well together to help new children settle into the centre, when they move from the nursery to the preschool, and when they move on to school. Teachers have developed close relationships with local schools. They work with them to use transition-to-school processes that ensure successful outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Children with special education needs are well integrated into the programme and supported by teachers and outside specialist agencies. Children benefit from a strong focus on providing an individual approach to their wellbeing during all stages of their learning. This includes some families choosing to have their children remain at the centre until their sixth birthday.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from having caring and nurturing teachers who support their sense of security and wellbeing. Teachers are respectful and responsive to the individual interests and capabilities of children. They provide well-paced routines where infants and toddlers are given time to be fully involved. Children are confident to freely explore activities of interest and make their own discoveries.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers work well together to promote a shared philosophy of providing positive outcomes for children and families. The strengths and interests of teachers are valued and well used. Teachers are provided with opportunities to use their skills to extend on the learning programme and grow their own leadership skills.</p><p>The managers and teachers are focused on consistently improving the quality of education and care. The centre’s strategic planning clearly identifies the centre goals that help achieve the centre’s philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop programme planning documentation and evaluate the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase bicultural perspectives in the environment and teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to refine and embed management practices that include the documentation of job descriptions for leaders and use of new appraisal systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend self review to inquire more deeply into teaching and learning, and to evaluate the impact of teaching practices on children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Woodend Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Woodend Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
