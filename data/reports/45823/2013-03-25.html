<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Pakuranga Learning Centre is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Pakuranga Learning Centre provides full day early childhood education and care for up to 50 children from birth to five years. The centre changed ownership during 2012 and was relicensed in November 2012. It was previously known as Gymkids Preschool Learning Centre and Nursery. While there are separate areas for children under and over two, all children play together for parts of the day. This is ERO&rsquo;s first review of the centre under this name.</p><p>Since the change of ownership in 2012, there have been significant staff changes. Centre managers have worked hard to develop a cohesive teaching team. There is a good combination of experienced and qualified staff and favourable teacher to child ratios. New resources have been purchased and the owner has plans to upgrade the children&rsquo;s outdoor area. Teachers are developing a shared understanding of the centre&rsquo;s policies, procedures, programme and systems for planning.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, happy and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. Interactions with children are supportive and affirming. Teachers know children well, converse frequently with them and encourage them to join in group activities. Infants benefit from attentive and individualised care. Teachers are establishing good partnerships with parents and are growing a sense of community. They are eager to strengthen their bicultural practices and use of te reo M&#257;ori. More experienced teachers effectively role model and mentor newer staff.</p><p>The environment is spacious, well resourced, with good opportunities for physical challenge in the gym area. Children know teacher expectations and are eager to learn. However, children spend a significant part of the day involved in routines and teacher-directed learning. Teachers should increase strategies that extend child-initiated play and foster more challenging learning experiences. This could include greater promotion of literacy and numeracy learning in the context of play. Teachers could also:</p><ul>
<li>organise the daily programme so that children have more access to outdoor play and opportunities for uninterrupted self-initiated play for a greater part of the day</li>
<li>consider how they could develop conversations with children to promote their independent thinking, language development and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>increase children&rsquo;s independent access to resources that encourage creativity and support more complex play.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are developing a shared understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum framework, and trialling new ways of programme planning. The centre owner is keen to improve assessment, planning and evaluation practices by engaging teachers in external centre-wide professional development. This could include:</p><ul>
<li>more parent and child involvement in assessment and planning</li>
<li>recording how children&rsquo;s individual interests were noticed, responded to and built on</li>
<li>identifying meaningful next steps for children that include adults&rsquo; role in building on children&rsquo;s learning and development beyond the provision of activities and resources</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies in extending children&rsquo; interests and ideas.</li>
</ul><p>Good management and effective administration systems are in place. As the centre has been under new management for a relatively short time, self review is in the early stages of development. A sound policy framework and management plans have been developed to guide the centre&rsquo;s direction. Centre managers are aware that engaging in external professional development would assist them in developing robust self review to guide improvements to the centre and the educational programme.</p><p>It would be useful to review the centre philosophy and then evaluate the extent to which strategic planning, learning and teaching align to it. Implementing appraisal that supports teachers to reflect on and improve their practice would also be a timely development. Evaluating the impact of any changes, in consultation with parents and staff, should ensure that reviews undertaken are transparent, collaborative and focused on improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ul>
<li>whole centre external professional development would assist staff in developing robust self review, improving programme planning and providing a more child-initiated programme</li>
<li>centre managers should develop an action plan to guide improvements in response to the findings of this report.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pakuranga Learning Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the centre manager should ensure that all non registered staff are police vetted.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
