</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Treasures Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned service that provides full day education and care for up to 35 children aged from two to five years. Most of the children, families and staff live in the Stoke community. Approximately one third of the children are MƒÅori.</p><p>The owners, service provider and head teacher have joint responsibility for ensuring that children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning are promoted. Their respective governance, management and leadership roles are clearly defined and well understood. They have addressed the areas identified for development in the May 2010 ERO report and continue to focus on improving the quality of outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre philosophy is soundly based on national education priorities, community needs and parents‚Äô aspirations. The head teacher oversees daily operations and provides professional leadership. Over 80% of the teaching staff are suitably qualified.</p><p>The centre was relicensed in 2012 under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</em></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in an environment that is well equipped, home-like and nurturing. Indoor and outdoor areas provide a wide range of opportunities for children to explore, experiment, create, imagine and be challenged.</p><p>Staff are warm and friendly in their interactions with children, whƒÅnau and colleagues. Children develop a sense of belonging and show confidence in their relationships with each other and with adults. Transitions into the centre and on to school are well managed.</p><p>The centre vision and values are clearly articulated and highly evident in daily practice. Each child is respected as a unique individual, with particular strengths, needs and interests. The wellbeing and progress of children with special needs are addressed with care and sensitivity.</p><p>Early literacy and mathematics concepts are integrated authentically into conversations and activities. Teachers effectively balance the goal of promoting and extending learning with fostering free spontaneous play.</p><p>Individual learning plans incorporate what teachers notice and recognise and what parents want for their children. Goals are set and shared, and development monitored over time. Stories in each child‚Äôs profile book are closely aligned with current focus areas. Observations by all staff contribute to these books as comprehensive and meaningful records of children‚Äôs learning and development. The quality and effectiveness of teachers‚Äô responses to what they know about children are a strength of the centre.</p><p>Further evidence of this personalised approach to education and care is seen in the way teachers show their respect for and valuing of te ao MƒÅori. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are seamlessly woven into routines, interactions, resources and daily programmes. All children enjoy learning kupu and waiata MƒÅori, and staff are committed to building their own knowledge and bicultural awareness. MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau experience an environment where their language, culture and identity are highly valued.</p><p>Effective governance and management underpin the success of the centre. Policies, procedures and systems are well understood and regularly reviewed. The owners maintain regular communication and close collegial relationships with staff. Their involvement in the life of the centre enables them to monitor and support the wellbeing of children and staff. Decision-making and allocation of resources are informed by robust self review. The strategic plan clearly defines priorities for ongoing improvement and development. A set of actions sits under each goal and progress against these is carefully tracked.</p><p>The head teacher has a strong improvement focus and manages change well. She leads a collaborative team whose professional practice and personal relationships contribute to successful outcomes for children and the achievement of the centre‚Äôs strategic goals. She demonstrates clear appreciation of the purpose and value of evaluation and self review.</p><p>Staff successfully engage parents and whƒÅnau in children‚Äôs learning and in the life of the centre. Annual surveys seek feedback, which influences subsequent planning. Parents express high levels of satisfaction with the strong sense of partnership between them and the centre. They affirmed the positive relationships and high quality education and care that their children enjoy.</p><p>One of the centre‚Äôs key strategic objectives is to increase participation in early childhood education in the local community. To help bring this about, the centre offers families a half day free for children each week and remains open for most public holidays. These initiatives demonstrate the owners and staff‚Äôs commitment to encouraging families to access their service. The availability of additional hours enables more children to benefit from continuity of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A new system for appraising staff is being trialled. Centre managers recognise that they need a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of this system.</p><p>Centre managers are considering ways to refine annual planning to ensure that action plans are manageable and goals achievable within realistic time frames.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Treasures Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Treasures Early Learning Centre will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
