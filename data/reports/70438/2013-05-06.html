<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Rangi Ruru Pre-School is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Rangi Ruru Pre-School is a community pre-school operating under the policies of the Rangi Ruru Girls&rsquo; School Board of Governors. The service provider nominee of the centre is the director of the Rangi Ruru Early Childhood College. The centre operates in a converted house on the school grounds.</p><p>Since the July 2009 ERO review there have been changes in staffing, including a new head teacher. The new teaching team has developed a centre vision based on Manaakitanga (caring and kindness), awhi mai awhi atu (relationships), whakamana (empowerment), and ako (learning together). The centre was recently relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have made good use of bicultural values to develop a clear and useful philosophy and vision statement. The philosophy is shared by staff, clearly understood and well reflected in teachers&rsquo; practices, the programme, the environment and assessment.</p><p>Children benefit from positive and respectful relationships with their teachers. Teachers provide high quality teaching interactions. They see children as very capable and creative learners. Teachers use inclusive practices that value individuals, celebrate diversity and other cultures. Children&rsquo;s identity, who they are as a learner, and how they can contribute to their own learning, is actively fostered.</p><p>Children are confident communicators who lead the programme. They play well alongside other children and their teachers. Teachers provide a flexible learning approach that is responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and ideas. Literacy learning is well supported. Teachers place a strong focus on getting children to inquire more deeply about their ideas and to problem solve. They engage children in meaningful learning conversations that support children&rsquo;s use of language. Teachers make good use of technology to help children to investigate and explore ideas. All children have good opportunities to learn about te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in ways that are naturally integrated into the programme and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>The teaching team values parent involvement and contribution to the programme. Teachers use a range of ways to make sure parents are well informed about the learning programme and make good use of parent views to inform the future direction of the programme and centre.</p><p>The teaching team has close links with the community, including the local school and Early Childhood Education College. This provides a range of extended and interesting learning experiences for children.</p><p>Since the last ERO review centre leaders and teachers have been involved in targeted professional development which has had a positive impact on teaching and learning. Professional development in assessment has resulted in children having greater ownership and revisiting of their learning.</p><p>Teachers work well together and have a shared belief for ongoing improvement to teaching and learning. The centre leaders value and make good use of the individual strengths of teachers. Teachers are well supported to share their expertise within the centre, with students at the college, and other early childhood teachers.</p><p>Useful long term planning is guiding centre development. Teachers use very effective processes to find out what is working well and what needs to be improved. They regularly review their practices in-depth and make good use of research to inform their thinking and decisions about the programme. This self review is a key feature in helping them to continually improve the quality of teaching and learning and promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Teachers promote positive outcomes for M&#257;ori children. They use research and Ministry of Education resources that promote success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori. M&#257;ori perspectives are becoming more evident in centre documents, planning and assessment approaches, and teachers' practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers have made good use of their own self review to identify the next steps to improve outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring recent changes to strengthen assessment continue to be well reflected in records of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>strengthening appraisal to make closer links to the revised philosophy and registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>Regular relievers are now in the programme on a daily basis. As a result of this change, ERO recommends reviewing the systems for managing relieving staff to maintain consistent highly effective practices.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rangi Ruru Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>6 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
