</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mt Roskill Baptist Kindergarten is a Christian, community focused kindergarten that provides both sessional and full day programmes for up to 45 children between two and five years of age. The philosophy is centred on providing a caring and supportive environment for children and their families, fostering a strong sense of belonging and supporting children to be confident and competent learners. Children from many different cultures are represented in the kindergarten.</p><p>The appointment of a new head teacher has provided an opportunity to review the quality of the programme, and in particular, to increase the extent to which the curriculum is responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities. The management team comprises of the centre owner, the head teacher, a community representative, and a representative from the Baptist church sited in front of the kindergarten. The special relationship with the church has influenced the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy, and Christian values and beliefs are integrated into the programme.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, changes to the licence have allowed the kindergarten to provide a full day programme for a limited number of children. A positive impact of this is that the kindergarten now has full rolls.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report noted the need to strengthen management planning and self review, and to develop more child-initiated approaches. The management team has made good progress to address each of these areas. They have developed a long term plan, with a vision and planned goals to work towards. Staff have accessed external professional development to establish systems and processes for self review and improve the quality of the appraisal system. They also engaged in professional learning and discussions about how they could enact a child-initiated philosophy, and improve the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, settled and capable learners. They experience warm and affirming relationships with teachers and caring friendships with other children. Children‚Äôs identities, languages and cultures are affirmed, enhancing their sense of wellbeing and belonging. They enjoy the play-based learning programmes that teachers provide. Children make choices about their own play and select easily accessible resources to support their activities. Teachers support children with resources and talk to them about their play. They encourage English language learning, and include te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in daily routines.</p><p>Teachers know children well and recognise each one‚Äôs individuality. They build on the interests of groups of children and these form the basis of planning. A strong focus on literacy and numeracy is evident. A range of mathematical resources are provided to build on children‚Äôs early numeracy concepts. A next step is to further integrate these concepts into the context of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their creativity, cooperative skills and physical abilities. Significant improvements to the outdoor areas have effectively stimulated children‚Äôs interest and enabled them to sustain play for longer periods of time. Centre managers are also keen to review and improve the quality of the indoor learning environment.</p><p>Teachers have very positive relationships with parents. They have increased consultation and communication with parents about their children‚Äôs learning. This will be strengthened with the planned introduction of e-portfolios.</p><p>The management team provide good leadership. Teachers are well supported by the owner and management team to develop their teaching skills. Professional learning and development for staff and a new appraisal system have focused on self review, growing leadership, and developing reflective practice. Teachers are working collaboratively with the centre owner to improve the quality of the programme for children, to strengthen partnerships with parents and establish effective self review.</p><p>The management team has undertaken a comprehensive review of the kindergarten's philosophy, organisation and policies. Goal setting is becoming more evident in centre operations which will help the management team and staff to evaluate progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and head teacher agree that the next stage of development should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>encouraging more complex play and supporting children to sustain play for longer periods of time</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children to create, problem solve and explore independently</li>
<li>capturing children‚Äôs individual interests, strengths and abilities more clearly in the learning stories</li>
<li>building coherence between the business, strategic, annual and action plans in order to better evaluate progress towards achieving goals</li>
<li>continuing to support staff development and reflection on the outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mt Roskill Baptist Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mt Roskill Baptist Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
