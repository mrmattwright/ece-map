</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newton Street Childcare is a privately owned, full-day education and care service located in Mt Maunganui. It is licensed for 45 children, including 12 under the age of two years. The centre caters for a diverse community, including children whose first language is not English. At the time of this ERO review there were 47 children enrolled, 13 of whom identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre provides for children over two in a mixed-age tuakana-teina setting. Children under two are cared for in separate indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>One of the centre owners is the manager and head teacher. She has governance and management responsibilities including oversight of strategic planning and compliance with legislative requirements. She also oversees staff performance management and leadership of learning, and is supported by a team leader who oversees the children under two years of age. The centre staff is a team of ten, the majority of whom are qualified ECE teachers. This is a new teaching team since the previous ERO report in 2015.</p><p>The aim of the centre is to develop and foster each child‚Äôs physical, intellectual, emotional, social and language skills, and provide a positive foundation for future learning and life skills. Centre management has responded well to the previous ERO review in 2015, addressing all areas that were identified for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is responsive to children‚Äôs needs and emerging interests. Assessment information focuses on dispositional learning and identifying possible developmental pathways for each child. There is a strong focus on promoting positive behaviour and children‚Äôs social literacy. The environment and resources support children‚Äôs play and exploration in all learning areas, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>Each child's language, culture and identity is recognised and supported, and there are opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to be actively involved in learning activities. There has been a deliberate and planned response to building teachers‚Äô cultural competence. Productive relationships have been established with local marae. Children participate in a wide range of experiences focused on developing their sense of well-being and belonging.</p><p>Aspects of teacher practice effectively promote positive learning outcomes for children. Key teachers assist the formation of secure relationships, and children, parents and whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers are inclusive in their practice and use appropriate strategies to support children with additional needs, including children whose first language is not English.</p><p>Children up to two years of age are cared for through responsive interactions in a settled environment. Transitions within the centre are sensitively managed. Children experience learning in a nurturing and welcoming environment.</p><p>Leadership is effectively building capability within the centre. Useful practices have been developed to create a strong culture of collaboration and shared learning. Leaders have established a thorough inquiry framework and provide relevant professional development opportunities. Teachers reflect on and evaluate their teaching practice through a process that is ongoing and intentional. Children benefit from a centre culture that is underpinned by positive relationships for learning.</p><p>Centre governance creates conditions that support positive learning outcomes for children. The centre annual plans are focused on teaching and learning, and regular self review is informed by focused inquiries undertaken by leaders and teachers. Positive working relationships to support professional learning have been developed with other early childhood centres. Useful systems and processes contribute to sustained improvements to centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to continue to promote intentional teaching for consistency across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to undertake centre-wide professional development on the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> in order to inform the local curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to increase ways to include parent voice in assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newton Street Childcare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured</li>
<li>the premises conform to any relevant bylaws of the local authority. <br><em>[Licensing criteria for Education and care centres 2008, HS6, PF3].</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Newton Street Childcare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>26 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
