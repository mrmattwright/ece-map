</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springvale Playcentre is one of four parent-led services under the umbrella of the Wanganui Playcentre Association (the association). It is licensed for 25 children, including 15 aged up to two years. At the time of this review, of the 48 children enrolled, five were Maori. The majority of children attending were aged under four.</p><p>The association president and office holders, along with a delegate from each playcentre, form the governance group (executive) for the association. The executive provides general guidance and support for members, including: leadership for strategic planning; financial management; policy development; and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment.</p><p>A support person, employed by the association, visits each centre and provides professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. In 2016, support from other associations has been sought and professional learning and development (PLD) accessed to strengthen operation, through the Playcentre Federation.</p><p>Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. At Springvale Playcentre, one employed, teacher-trained coordinator supports parents and whƒÅnau to develop and implement the daily programme and manage administration requirements.</p><p>At the time of this review, co-presidents shared the centre leadership role. While many members were new, key office roles were filled and a strong drive to strengthen participation in the training programme was evident. Roll numbers had been stable over time.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report, identified the need to support members‚Äô understanding and use of self review, annual and strategic planning, and planning for learning. The association also needed to implement processes to support centre operation, including police vetting for non-teacher registered employees, an appraisal to support the developmental needs of the coordinator and, a system for monitoring sleeping children. Progress is evident.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of four education reviews in the Wanganui Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A new philosophy is being developed. This should support shared understanding of values and expectations underpinning the learning programme.</p><p>A strong sense of family and community is evident. Members are friendly and welcoming. Many have long-term associations with the centre and each other. Collegial, collaborative teamwork is well established amongst these members.</p><p>Children are settled, cooperative and happy learners, confident in the environment and with those around them. They display a strong sense of belonging at playcentre and show enjoyment having their parents working alongside them.</p><p>Members are responsive, supportive and involved. Many are building their confidence as they work as part of a team providing learning experiences for children. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interaction.</p><p>Children have a high degree of ownership of the learning programme. Their own rhythms and ideas define what they participate in and when. They have free access to a wide range of learning materials and are given space and time to explore and investigate. Much sustained play is evident throughout sessions.</p><p>Aspects of mathematics, literacy, creativity and physically challenging play are well resourced and integrated into play experiences. Recent PLD in mathematics has supported members to notice, recognise and respond to children's mathematics learning through play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well integrated into sessions. They are encouraged to explore, play and take part in planned learning experiences with and alongside older peers. Some review has been undertaken to strengthen provision for this younger group. Members should continue to work on improving the range of resources and opportunities that specifically support the learning of these children.</p><p>Planning for learning is a work in progress led by the coordinator. Children's current interests are displayed to support all members to work purposefully with all children. Individual portfolios record each child's participation in the programme and aspects of their learning.</p><p>Members' approach should be strengthened by using session evaluations more effectively to collaboratively record children's significant interests, developing learning dispositions and next steps for learning. Progress should be made visible in children's portfolios.</p><p>Understanding of play-based planning-for-learning and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is likely to be further strengthened as more members move through their training.</p><p>A commitment to bicultural practice is strongly expressed at association level. At Springvale Playcentre, a bicultural officer supports members' understanding and use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.¬†</p><p>Members have identified their next steps as rebuilding a relationship with mana whenua and better integrating te reo MƒÅori into their everyday work with children. Acknowledgement of MƒÅori language, protocols and values in other aspects of practice such as planning, and the development of guiding documents, should also be considered.</p><p>Members want to strengthen provision for older children including support for their transition to primary school. They should continue to work on developing their ability to articulate the value of playcentre's learning programme. This, together with accessing uptodate information about good practice in supporting children's transition to school, should provide a suitable starting point for purposeful discussions with primary school personnel.</p><p>Recent PLD has been focused on developing members' understanding and use of internal evaluation. A useful framework has been introduced linked to up-to-date practice in the education sector. Implementation of the new approach is at an early stage.</p><p>Improved support from the association is evident. The redefined administrative role has resulted in a more systematic approach to aspects of operation such as financial management, policy review, and communication.</p><p>An appraisal process for employees is in the early stages of implementation. The approach needs to be significantly strengthened to provide effective support for the development of the coordinator and meet Education Council requirements for Practising Teacher Certificates.</p><p>To build sustainability and shared understanding of practice and operation, the association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give priority to supporting leadership and teamwork at centre level, including ensuring that guidelines are understood and kept up to date and relevant; and that appropriate succession planning and officeholder induction are in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>introduce a more strategic and formalised approach to the centre support worker role linked to centre needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure centre long-term planning, reporting and review processes are adequate to effectively inform decisions about association priorities for development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should continue to provide support for the centre to effectively implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process for the coordinator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthened provision for older children, including support for the transition to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practices, through strengthening te ao MƒÅori knowledge and understandings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practices that support sustainability of operation.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springvale Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Springvale Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
