<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre is situated in the central city area of Rotorua. It caters for children admitted to the children&rsquo;s ward of Rotorua Hospital, and also offers support in other areas of the hospital. The service promotes the social and emotional well-being of children receiving hospital care, and supports their parents, siblings and wh&#257;nau. The centre is permitted to enrol up to 28 children and up to 25 of these may be under two. The roll numbers vary widely, and at the time of the review four children were enrolled, of whom three were under two years of age. Two children were identified as M&#257;ori. Families included in the service identify with a range of cultures.</p><p>The centre aims to assist children to gain an understanding of their treatment, and uses play to support their learning, and development. The large activity room set up for the centre&rsquo;s use also provides for children over school age, as well as parents and siblings. The view from this room has special meaning for many of the families and provides comforting links to wh&#257;nau, the community and cultural identity. This environment is well presented, comfortable, and furnished with good-quality equipment and resources. Parents, visitors and hospital staff report that the play specialists (teachers) listen and respond to children&rsquo;s needs in caring ways. Siblings, wh&#257;nau and extended family members are included in the programme, and respect is shown for te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori, and for other cultures.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment is both informal and formal. Teachers record meaningful experiences by taking photographs of children at play and by writing learning stories that can, when appropriate, be shared with children and parents. Kanohi-ki-te-kanohi interactions with wh&#257;nau are especially valuable for exchanging ideas and information.</p><p>A next step is for play specialists to revisit the assessment and planning documentation to consider how they can best use it for programme planning, reflections about the quality of teaching and learning, and as evidence to support appraisal. Together with an increased emphasis on educational leadership and appraisal, this self review should lead to further improvements in the quality of the service.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre offers a service that promotes the social and emotional well-being of children receiving hospital care and supports their parents, siblings and wh&#257;nau. It aims to assist children to gain an understanding of their treatment and uses play to support their learning and development. The centre is licensed to operate throughout the children&rsquo;s ward. The large activity room set up for the centre&rsquo;s use also accommodates children over school age, as well as parents and siblings.</p><p>The two play specialists with responsibility for the operation of the centre are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. They are often assisted by voluntary personnel. In addition to their responsibility for education and care, the play specialists assist children to understand hospital procedures. They may be involved in supporting children undergoing procedures in other areas of the hospital. The charge play specialist formally qualified as a play specialist in 2010.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the centre has had a change of licensee. After its relicensing under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 a further change was made and a new management representative appointed. New relief staff and a volunteer have been recruited.</p><p>During the review there was a seasonal fall in numbers of children admitted to the hospital. Reviewers were unable to observe the programme in action for children of preschool age visiting the activity room.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Interactions and relationships:</strong> Parents, visitors and hospital staff report that play specialists provide positive and supportive interactions with children and adults. Parents appreciate their ability to listen and respond to their children&rsquo;s needs. Siblings, wh&#257;nau and extended family members are included, and respect is shown for te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori, and for other cultures. The charge therapist has established relationships with the hospital community through her attendance at multi-disciplinary meetings and her willingness to contribute to the professional development of staff members.</p><p><strong>Environment:</strong> A special feature of the environment is its privileged location overlooking Ohinemutu, the marae and the lake. This view has special meaning for many of the families and provides comforting links to wh&#257;nau, the community and cultural identity. The environment is well presented, comfortable and furnished with good-quality equipment and resources. It is set up to offer a variety of activities suitable for both for individual children and for the different age groups that use the activity room. Teachers are also able to supply children with resources to use in their bed rooms and to supply items that help children to cope with hospital procedures.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> Programme planning and assessment is both informal and formal. These two main elements can be described as:</p><ul>
<li>immediate responses to the emotional, physical and social needs of the children who are present for a short period. This group can be defined as having &lsquo;acute conditions&rsquo;; and</li>
<li>a more planned and deliberate approach for children who stay for longer periods or who return periodically. This group can be defined as having &lsquo;chronic conditions&rsquo;.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers write brief reports for clinical records showing their interventions to support children, take photographs of children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme and, for some, write learning stories to record meaningful experiences. Their kanohi-ki-te-kanohi interactions with parents offer opportunities to model interactions that respond appropriately to children, and assist them to cope with their feelings. Teachers have responded creditably to the 2009 ERO review, which suggested that a more cohesive and reflective approach to curriculum implementation and programme delivery would be beneficial. Further development should enable the planning, assessment and evaluation processes to provide increased benefits for their work with children and their families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO and the management and play specialists agree that the next steps for the service are to review the purpose and manageability of assessment records, and to strengthen leadership capacity within the service.</p><p><strong>Self review of assessment and planning:</strong> Play specialists should revisit the assessment and planning documentation to consider how best to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>its usefulness for informing and involving children, parents, community and hospital personnel;</p>
</li>
<li>its potential for reflections about the quality of teaching and learning and as evidence to support appraisal; and</li>
<li>the manageability and accessibility of records.</li>
</ul><p>By identifying the purpose of curriculum documentation, and its relevance to programme implementation, teachers could tailor their record keeping in line with their priorities for children with acute or chronic conditions. They could also continue to adapt their processes to meet the different needs of individuals.</p><p><strong>Leadership:</strong> Consideration needs to be given to enhancing educational leadership within the staff team. Professional development and regular appraisal should give attention to:</p><ul>
<li>the consistent implementation of centre priorities and procedures; and</li>
<li>best practice in fulfilling expected teaching and therapeutic roles.</li>
</ul><p>Enhanced educational leadership should assist the play specialist team to focus on continued improvement to their service while maintaining flexibility to respond to complex situations.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that regular appraisals are undertaken of play specialists.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ol>
<li>

</table><p>12 June 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-rotorua-hospital-early-childhood-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre.</p><p>Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre is situated in the central city area of Rotorua. It caters for children admitted to the children&rsquo;s ward of Rotorua Hospital, and also offers support in other areas of the hospital. The service promotes the social and emotional well-being of children receiving hospital care, and supports their parents, siblings and wh&#257;nau. The centre is permitted to enrol up to 28 children and up to 25 of these may be under two. The roll numbers vary widely, and at the time of the review four children were enrolled, of whom three were under two years of age. Two children were identified as M&#257;ori. Families included in the service identify with a range of cultures.</p><p>The centre aims to assist children to gain an understanding of their treatment, and uses play to support their learning, and development. The large activity room set up for the centre&rsquo;s use also provides for children over school age, as well as parents and siblings. The view from this room has special meaning for many of the families and provides comforting links to wh&#257;nau, the community and cultural identity. This environment is well presented, comfortable, and furnished with good-quality equipment and resources. Parents, visitors and hospital staff report that the play specialists (teachers) listen and respond to children&rsquo;s needs in caring ways. Siblings, wh&#257;nau and extended family members are included in the programme, and respect is shown for te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori, and for other cultures.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment is both informal and formal. Teachers record meaningful experiences by taking photographs of children at play and by writing learning stories that can, when appropriate, be shared with children and parents. Kanohi-ki-te-kanohi interactions with wh&#257;nau are especially valuable for exchanging ideas and information.</p><p>A next step is for play specialists to revisit the assessment and planning documentation to consider how they can best use it for programme planning, reflections about the quality of teaching and learning, and as evidence to support appraisal. Together with an increased emphasis on educational leadership and appraisal, this self review should lead to further improvements in the quality of the service.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
