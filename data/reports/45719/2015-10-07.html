</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Cubbyhouse Childcare is one of three privately owned centres in the North Island. It is located on the outskirts of Masterton. The service is licensed to provide all day education and care for a maximum of 60 children, including 20 up to two years, in three age-appropriate learning spaces.</p><p>The two directors of the services provide governance and ongoing management support to the centre manager who oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre and is responsible for building professional practice. Key teachers guide curriculum implementation, assessment and evaluation practice.</p><p>The centre manager and key teachers all hold practising certificates. Two staff are provisionally registered and involved in ongoing mentoring as they work toward full teacher registration status. The centre‚Äôs teaching team also includes two in training for teaching qualifications and an untrained support person.</p><p>In September 2013 ERO undertook the first review of this centre and signalled a return within two years. Significant changes to staffing have taken place since then. ERO indentified management needed to improve centre systems, leadership, and teaching and learning practices in order to meet the regulatory requirements and promote more positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre management, with the Ministry of Education, formulated a development plan to address key issues. External support, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO), contributes to progress in centre practices, management, leadership and teacher capability.</p><p>The directors have focused on establishing an effective organisational culture, a collaborative teaching team and positive educational partnerships with families and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive practices identified in the previous ERO report have been sustained. Families are well informed about their children‚Äôs learning and care. Infants and toddlers are cared for in a nurturing, warm environment. Learning through MƒÅori culture and te reo MƒÅori is visible across the centre. Many children continue to be engage well with others of similar age</p><p>Planned and spontaneous experiences for children are becoming more responsive to children‚Äôs interests as a result of teachers developing a shared understanding of the service‚Äôs philosophy. This reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Leaders and teachers are clearer about the desired outcomes they seek for children. This provides a positive platform for learning.</p><p>Leaders‚Äô and teachers‚Äô professional development enhances children‚Äôs care and learning. Steady progress is evident in relation to a well-considered strategic plan and supporting development plan. These have the potential to further enhance children‚Äôs experiences and to sustain improvements made to the environment and programme.</p><p>Ongoing review of the centre philosophy contributes to aspects of the curriculum becoming an integral part of children‚Äôs early childhood experience. This is particularly noticeable for the youngest children. Inclusive practice and a focus on supporting children‚Äôs cultures and languages across the three age groups have improved.</p><p>Teachers are trialling a framework for assessment, programme planning and evaluation. The aim of this child-centred programme is for adults to notice individual interests and support learning through specific strategies. Although there is some variability in the quality of teachers‚Äô interactions with children, they continue to make steady progress.</p><p>The teachers know children and their preferences well. Families are informed about how the programme supports children‚Äôs developing skills, knowledge and competencies.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitioning into the centre and between learning spaces is well considered. This is determined by the child's readiness, and in consultation with families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>As children get older they are involved in more teacher-led group learning experiences. These have an emphasis on the inclusion of te ao MƒÅori, literacy and mathematical skills. However, further review is needed to ensure that children are able to fully follow their interests within the centre programme.</p><p>The centre directors and teaching staff work collaboratively. External SELO support increases teachers‚Äô curriculum knowledge and supports the development of systems and processes to promote the service‚Äôs strategic direction. Self review for both accountability and improvement is well understood and contributes positively to improved practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners. Performance management systems are in place and support improved practice. Appraisal of teaching staff and mentoring programmes for provisionally registered teachers aligns to the services strategic direction and improving teachers‚Äô knowledge. The use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners,</em> contributes positively to teachers' culturally responsive practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It is timely to review centre routines and group learning experiences to ensure they are responsive to children‚Äôs strengths, interests and needs. This should consider:</p><ul>
<li>how well children guide their own learning with adult support within centre routines</li>
<li>the continuity of care, nurture and a responsive curriculum to all age groups by building on the teacher practice guidelines for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>review centre practices to enable children fuller access to physical learning spaces and resources to pursue their ideas and to increase the complexity of learning and play.</li>
</ul><p>To embed key systems, centre directors should review and develop teacher performance management processes to:</p><ul>
<li>include leadership goals and specific support for staff in mentoring and coaching roles</li>
<li>strengthen observational feedback to better support individual teachers</li>
<li>to ensure the endorsement of teacher practising certificates reflects the requirements of the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Cubbyhouse Childcare (Masterton) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of The Cubbyhouse Childcare (Masterton) Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
