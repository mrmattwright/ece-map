</table><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Hastings is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes and the well being of children. Intentional professional learning and development has enhanced teachers‚Äô evaluative capacity.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos delivers a range of early childhood care and education, and child and family services throughout New Zealand. Barnardos Early Learning Centre is located in Mayfair, Hastings. The service provides all day education and care for 45 children including 12 children aged up to 2 years. A head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the service and for leading teaching and learning.</p><p>A Barnardos business manager and professional leader support centre leaders to provide high quality, community-relevant early childhood care and education. ‚ÄúKo NgƒÅ Tamariki i te Tuatahi‚Äù (Children come first) encapsulates Barnardos approach. The service‚Äôs vision is ‚ÄúKi Aotearoa nei he taonga te tamaiti, me ƒÅna manako ki te whanake‚Äù (In Aotearoa New Zealand, childhood is valued and each child‚Äôs hope and potential are nurtured).</p><p>There is high participation and involvement by the community. Of the 54 children enrolled, 36 are MƒÅori. Reciprocal, respectful relationships among teachers, children, parents, whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi contribute to a positive platform for partnerships for learning. The centre philosophy prioritises whakawhanaungatanga and aroha as key to interactions and relationships. Children‚Äôs strengths, interests and desires are nurtured.</p><p>The service has a sound ERO reporting history. The April 2010 ERO report recognised that staff effectively used self review to improve the education and care of children. Centre leaders and teachers are highly reflective practitioners interested in current early childhood theory and research.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum, underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, draws on the natural environment and sensory experiences to promote children‚Äôs holistic growth. Aesthetically pleasing resources and uncluttered spaces allow children to lead their own creative learning. Teachers astutely nurture infants', toddlers' and young children‚Äôs natural rhythms.</p><p>The philosophy weaves peacefulness and respect as a basis for partnerships. The importance of people is paramount to everything, "He tangata! He tangata! He tangata!" Teachers acknowledge and respect Mana Whenua. Celebrating this partnership and including te ao MƒÅori enriches babies, young children and teachers‚Äô daily experience.</p><p>Effective leadership of assessment and planning guides teaching and learning. Practice aligns well to the centre philosophy and enriches the early childhood experience of children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children actively engage in a varied range of planned and spontaneous learning. Their thinking and language is extended through sustained interactions with supportive adults.</p><p>Self-review processes strongly focus on strengthening teachers‚Äô practices and improving outcomes for children and whƒÅnau. Effective support from Barnardos managers assists in building the centre‚Äôs evaluative capacity. Performance management has recently been reviewed. The amended processes for appraisal include attestation against the Registered Teacher Criteria. Centre leaders are exploring aspects of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>. Including these has potential to further enhance teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The recent introduction of <em>Te Whatu Pokeka (Kaupapa MƒÅori Assessment Framework)</em> provides an authentic lens for teaching as inquiry, encourages a depth of understanding and upholds partnerships for learning. Teachers are considering research in te ao MƒÅori conceptual thinking around sustainability and peace. This should assist teachers to more clearly interpret, reflect and respond to the aspirations, and evaluate the goals, held for children.</p><p>A review of how the teaching of literacy supports children‚Äôs development is a current focus. As part of this, leaders should consider how well the centre curriculum contributes to continuity of learning as children transition to the school‚Äôs curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Hastings completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p><strong>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</strong></p><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Centre Hastings will be in four years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
