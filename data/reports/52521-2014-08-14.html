</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Turitea Childcare Centre is situated in a semi-rural setting within the AgResearch Grasslands site in Palmerston North. The community-based early childhood education and care service provides all day care for children up to the age of five and is licensed for 39 children. Of the 47 children enrolled, two are Māori.</p><p>A centre manager oversees the inside and outside areas. There are two team leaders, one for the over twos and one for those children up to two. Toddlers and infants are nurtured by a specific teacher responsible for their needs.</p><p>The centre philosophy gives priority to authentic experiences where children can explore and discover on a daily basis. Children’s interactions centre on a farmland and large playground outdoor environment.</p><p>Positive aspects of practice identified in the October 2011 ERO report continue to be evident. The service has a sound reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive, respectful and caring relationships with teachers and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They are relaxed, responsive and confident to ask questions and offer answers in learning situations with teachers and peers. Teachers are consistent in their interactions with children. The children and teachers know each other well.</p><p>An intentional approach to hands-on learning provides many opportunities for children to learn through practice. They engage in sustained play. Their independence is encouraged and there are many occasions for them to lead and make learning decisions.</p><p>Children actively participate in a curriculum that responds to their strengths, interests and developmental needs. <em>Te Whāriki</em> is the basis for planning, assessing and evaluating children’s learning. Teachers successfully analyse assessment information to understand children’s learning pathways and then plan to extend and strengthen these experiences.</p><p>Assessments illustrate and support continuity in learning and demonstrate children’s progress in a range of contexts. Portfolios reflect teachers’ responsiveness to children’s needs and interests and celebrate their learning in a variety of ways.</p><p>The curriculum promotes literacy, mathematics and science, which are appropriately woven into the programme. Children show keen interest in their learning within their whānau groups and across the centre. Community participation and involvement is evident. Parents and whānau contributions are invited, valued and responded to. </p><p>Success for Māori as Māori is visible in the environment, through children’s portfolios, resources and interactions. Teachers are building capability through intentional planning, modelling and centre wide dialogue. Children experience the landmarks and stories of Rangitāne.</p><p>Students with complex needs are well supported. Leaders have identified that their next step is a deliberate responsiveness to the needs of their diverse community.</p><p>Teachers actively foster language development. Children are involved in making decisions about their learning. They are empowered to take increasing responsibility for their own wellbeing and that of others. </p><p>Transition into and within the centre and to school is well considered. Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured during the process. It is responsive to the points of view of children, parents, whānau and teachers.</p><p>An established management committee of parents and the centre manager effectively manage the centre operations. There is alignment between the vision, philosophy and strategic direction.</p><p>Self review informs decision making. Leaders acknowledge that self review is in its initial stages. The processes are designed to strengthen teachers’ practice and improve outcomes for children. Suitable performance management systems are in place and include attestation against the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>A shared, collaborative leadership model (distributed leadership) is in its early stages. Centre policies and procedures support capability and sustainability. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the next steps are to further:</p><ul>
<li>develop te reo me ngā tikanga Māori through curriculum and centre practice</li>
<li>progress self review  </li>
<li>develop the appraisal process for management and staff</li>
<li>build partnerships with and be responsive to the needs of parents and whānau. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Turitea Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Turitea Childcare Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region</p><p>14 August 2014 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
