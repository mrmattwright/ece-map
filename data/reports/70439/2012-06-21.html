<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Rakaia Playcentre is one of eight playcentres managed by the Mid Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association provides the framework and support for the operation of the centre. The parents and supervisors are responsible for the daily management of the centre and the programme provided for children. High child to adult ratios are maintained at mixed-age sessions.</p><p>Rakaia Playcentre provides good quality education and care for children. Children benefit from strong partnerships between the parents and supervisor that focus on their learning, development and well-being. The supervision team makes good use of the pre-session meetings, the programme plan and learning stories to support children&rsquo;s learning. The supervisor and parents maintain strong links with the local school and wider community.</p><p>The supervisor and parents are committed to participation in the playcentre parent education programme. They encourage parents to share their skills and knowledge to benefit all children. They make good use of self review to improve the quality of adult and child interactions. ERO observed the supervisor and parents using a good range of approaches to help children solve problems, develop their ideas and think creatively.</p><p>Children make effective use of the wide range of resources and equipment to develop their interests, skills and knowledge. The outdoor environment is well designed. It provides children with interesting challenges and problem solving opportunities.</p><p>Association personnel provide a good range of support and training for parents. They help parents ensure the centre maintains a high level of health and safety. They provide programmes and guidance to help supervisors and parents develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to successfully manage the centre and promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO, the association managers, the supervisor and parents agree that the next steps to improve children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the child profile books to clarify their purpose</li>
<li>increasing understanding, knowledge and pride in New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage and Tongan culture among the children and their families.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the service&rsquo;s vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the centre is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Rakaia Playcentre.</p><h3>How well placed is Rakaia Playcentre to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Context</h4><p>Rakaia Playcentre is well established and well used by local families. It has a number of sessions each week and full rolls. The playcentre parent education programme is well supported by families.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy states that the centre operates as a parent cooperative where parents are recognised as the child&rsquo;s first and best educator. The family unit is valued, promoted and supported. Each child is accepted, nurtured and provided with a stimulating and creative environment. <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> is reflected in the centre environment and culture.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a trial of ERO&rsquo;s revised approaches to reviews in early childhood education services. The trial used a cluster approach for the reviews of eight playcentres within the Mid Canterbury Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children benefit from strong partnerships between the supervisor and parents. The focus is fully on all children&rsquo;s learning, development and well-being. They spend considerable time with their own children and include others in this play. Children confidently take the lead in learning and are well supported by the supervisor and parents.</p><p>The supervision team makes good use of their pre session meeting, the programme plan and learning stories. These processes usually help parents identify the ways that they will work with children to extend their thinking. The supervisor and parents skilfully link home and centre experiences. They maintain strong links with local school and wider community to promote continuity in children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The supervisor and parents warmly welcome and support the participation of new families in the playcentre. They actively encourage them to share their skills and participate in the association&rsquo;s parent education programme. Parents told ERO that they are well supported to continue training and sharing their skills with others.</p><p>Children make effective use of the wide range of resources and equipment to develop their interests, skills and knowledge. The outdoor environment is well designed to provide children with interesting challenges and problem-solving opportunities. Younger children successfully integrate into these activities with support from parents and older children. Children are settled and engaged in meaningful, sustained learning.</p><p>The supervisor and parents make effective use of self review to improve the quality of their interactions to benefit children&rsquo;s learning. The supervisor has a good understanding of self review and skilfully involves parents in the process.</p><p>Strong leadership in the centre empowers parents and children. Roles and responsibilities are shared and well understood. Appropriate support is given to ensure success and build confidence.</p><p>The parents are well supported by the association in the day-to-day operation of the centre and children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association managers, centre supervisor and parents agree that the next steps to improve children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the child profiles to make sure the purpose is understood and the ways they support children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; learning is clear</li>
<li>developing an understanding and inclusion of M&#257;ori and Tongan cultures in consultation with M&#257;ori and Tongan families and the wider community</li>
<li>making closer links between the strategic plan, self review, supervisor appraisal and training to strengthen sustainability and capacity at association and centre levels.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Rakaia Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
