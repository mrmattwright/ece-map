</table><p>Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre 2 has been open for two years and is in a period of development. External support is needed to improve its curriculum, programme planning processes, and bicultural practices</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre 2 is licensed to provide short, medium and full day care for up to 60 children, including 12 under two years of age. This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review after opening in July 2014. It is a purpose-built facility with three separate play spaces. Children are grouped according to age into rooms for infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers. Children from a range of diverse ethnic backgrounds attend.</p><p>The centre is privately owned. The owner has recently restructured the management team and appointed an Education and Practice Manager and a Centre Administrator. Since the centre opened there have been a number of changes in staffing.</p><p>The centre philosophy has recently been reviewed. This review is ongoing as new centre staff are employed and inducted into the service, and as all teachers develop shared understandings of what the philosophy might look like in practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is welcoming to all children and their families. Children are well cared for. They settle quickly, and easily access available resources to engage in play of their own choosing. Teachers provide and maintain attractive learning environments. Some provide good role models for children‚Äôs developing language and become partners in children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Children under two enjoy a calm settled pace and warm respectful interactions with teachers. Secure attachments are supported through responsive caregiving. Teachers know children well and work within their individual routines. Teachers should now review the programme for toddlers to ensure it is responsive to the special characteristics and learning needs of these children.</p><p>Friendships are evident amongst older children. They concentrate well, and some chat in home languages with their peers and teachers. Preschool children have access to their portfolios of learning, which document their participation in the programme and include numerous photographs.</p><p>The quality of planning for children‚Äôs individual and group learning should be improved. All teaching teams should implement and evaluate a curriculum that is based on regular observations of children‚Äôs interests, needs, strengths and abilities. In some cases observations of children‚Äôs learning has not been documented for many months.</p><p>The curriculum is largely topic based and adult driven. Teachers' could involve children more in the design of the curriculum by recognising and responding to their interests and developmental learning. Children could also be encouraged to take leadership roles and responsibilities within the centre programme.</p><p>Teachers capture assessments of learning in some of the children‚Äôs home languages. They could now consider how the languages, cultures and identities of all children could be celebrated in curriculum documentation. The quality of assessment practice is variable.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified the development of bicultural practices as an area for further self review. This has the potential to encourage children to be confident in their own culture and develop understandings and respect for other cultures.</p><p>An effective process has been established for self review and includes in depth research of chosen topics. Teachers have reviewed routines, including the purpose and content of mat times. ERO encourages teachers to make stronger use of their learning through research, to continue to enhance teaching practices and programmes. ERO supports the ongoing review of child-led play to ensure that the programme is meaningfully engaging children.</p><p>A staff appraisal process has recently been established. Centre leaders are aware of the need to continue to strengthen the process to align with the requirements of the Education Council. The centre continues to endeavour to recruit and retain qualified teaching staff. Some centre policies and procedures have recently undergone review and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and centre leaders agree that their next key steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>seek external support for the improvement and updating of learning programmes, assessment and planning systems, and documentation</li>
<li>ensure all policies and procedures required to meet <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em> and <em>Early Childhood Education Curriculum Framework</em>, are established.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:¬†</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.¬†</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the centre‚Äôs curriculum.</p><p>To meet requirements teachers must:</p><p>1. Plan, implement and evaluate programmes based on Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum. <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, Regulation 43(1a) Curriculum standard: general.</em></p><p>2. Develop and implement policies which outline suitable human resource management practices which include:¬†</p><ul>
<li>selection and appointment procedures</li>
<li>job/role descriptions</li>
<li>induction procedures into the service</li>
<li>a system of appraisal</li>
<li>provision for professional development</li>
<li>a definition of serious misconduct</li>
<li>discipline/dismissal procedures.¬†</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> <em>Governance, management and administration; professional practices: GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre 2 will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
