</table><p>Playworx Kindy¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playworx Kindy is one of two early childhood services in Hamilton under the same private ownership. It is located in the suburb of Melville and is licensed for 24 children aged over two years. The current roll of 12, includes two children of MƒÅori and two of Samoan descent. The service operates from 8.00am to 3.30pm daily. Two of the three teachers have a recognised ECE qualification and one is in training.</p><p>The centre philosophy is ‚Äòthrough play, learning is fun‚Äô. Since the previous ERO review in 2016, the teaching team are all new to their roles. An experienced teacher, employed in 2016, provides professional leadership and guidance for teaching staff. She visits the centre fortnightly to work alongside teachers to strengthen the quality of education provided, and to implement and align the centre philosophy, self review, strategic planning and staff appraisal processes. The professional leader also works in the other Playworx centre in Hamilton.</p><p>The previous ERO review in 2016 identified significant improvements were needed in curriculum development and review, assessment planning and evaluation and bicultural practices. In addition, important aspects of the service were not compliant with licence requirements. The Ministry of Education then placed the service on a provisional licence until these requirements were met and a full licence was reissued in September 2017. ERO's 2019 review shows that the service has responded well to the areas for improvement, and compliance issues have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teacher, child relationships are respectful and responsive. Teachers work alongside children to support exploration and challenge. They ensure children‚Äôs wellbeing is prioritised and their care needs are well met. Children readily approach teachers and high levels of trust are evident during teacher child interactions. Teachers use a range of effective strategies to extend children‚Äôs learning and ideas. Children experience a strong sense of ownership and belonging in the kindy. Teachers need to undertake professional learning to more confidently use and model te reo MƒÅori as a functional language with children.</p><p>Children are able to choose from a range of resources and experiences. There are many opportunities for children to explore and challenge themselves in areas that are attractive, well presented and used in a range of flexible and open-ended ways. The centre environment and programme organisation allow children to engage in learning and exploration for sustained periods.</p><p>The programme is planned in response to children‚Äôs strengths, emerging ideas and interests. Teachers meet regularly to discuss children's emerging interests and themes, then plan the programme and environment to support each child's learning and development. Children experience a programme that reflects their ideas and supports their developing competencies.</p><p>Learning story assessments indicate that teachers are effectively noticing the learning that is occurring throughout the day. Many of these stories also show that teachers know each child well. They also show the way children's interests, skills or learning dispositions are developing over time. Individual learning portfolios enable children to share learning and revisit important experiences with teachers and whƒÅnau. Teachers need to consider ways to ensure these documents are more accessible to children.</p><p>Effective systems support teachers to improve their practice. A designated professional leader works closely with each teacher and with the teaching team to build capability. A coherent appraisal process is now in place to support teachers‚Äô professional learning journeys. Teachers are enthusiastic about continually improving outcomes for children. They need to continue with this programme of learning and support.</p><p>Processes for planned and spontaneous review are well documented. These processes provide sound guidelines for ongoing centre review and development. A three-year strategic plan is supported by an annual plan and ongoing review by teachers and leaders. Self review across the centre is resulting in improvements to the quality of education and care for children. Teachers and leaders need to seek ways to gather and more clearly document parent views as part of review and improvement processes.</p><p>It is important that the service develops policies and procedures to cater for children with diverse and special needs. No children with identified needs were enrolled at the time of this review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ol>
<li>Centre leadership needs to ensure:</li>
</ol><ul>
<ul>
<li>there is a robust review and inquiry processes that build professional capability and focus on improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>a greater level of parent and whƒÅnau views are included in curriculum, review and development processes</li>
<li>the curriculum, teaching interactions and assessments reflect and support the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori and Pacific children and families</li>
<li>Te WhƒÅriki 2017 is fully implemented</li>
<li>there are effective processes and partnerships with whƒÅnau that support children's transition to school.</li>
</ul>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Leaders need to systematically build leadership capability in the centre, including relevant job descriptions and programme of professional learning for those undertaking leadership roles.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Leaders need to develop policies and procedures for children with special and diverse educational or developmental needs.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playworx Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>11 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
