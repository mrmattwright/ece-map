</table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the programme and enhance positive outcomes for children. A number of legislative requirements have also been identified.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playworx Kindy is one of three privately owned early childhood services in Hamilton. It is located in the suburb of Melville and is licensed for 24 children aged over two years. Most families attending the service are from the local area and are MƒÅori. The service opened in 2011 and operates from 8.00am to 3.00pm daily.</p><p>The centre philosophy is currently being reviewed. Since the previous ERO review in 2013, two new qualified teachers have been employed.</p><p>The current owners/directors have identified the need to improve important aspects of the centre governance, management and leadership. In May 2016, they employed an experienced teacher to assist with these improvements. She works with staff one day per week to provide professional leadership in order to strengthen the implementation and alignment of the centre philosophy, self review, strategic planning and staff appraisal processes.</p><p>The new professional leader has established a broad outline to guide the development of these important aspects. She also works in two other Playworx centres in Hamilton and spends one day per week working alongside staff at the Melville centre.</p><p>This is the second ERO review of the service. Areas for development identified in the last 2013 ERO report about self review, programme planning and assessment have not been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The learning programme is planned in response to children‚Äôs interests and strengths and provides a wide variety of learning opportunities. Teachers prepare the environment to provide well-resourced and well-maintained areas for children‚Äôs play and exploration. These areas are set up to invite children‚Äôs curiosity and involvement through open-ended and sustained play. Children‚Äôs early literacy experiences are integrated into the programme of play and learning.</p><p>Children's individual learning portfolios contain a record of their involvement in the centre programme. These documents are accessible to children and families so they can share and revisit learning. The new professional leader is working with teachers to improve assessment practices, with an increasing focus on the different ways children learn (children's learning dispositions). Centre leadership is focused on improving the way teachers write learning stories that identify the learning taking place, progress that is being made and how teachers are adding complexity to children‚Äôs exploration and play.</p><p>An important next step for teachers is to ensure decisions about curriculum planning and development are informed by ongoing assessment of children's learning and evaluation of the programme of learning.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are sensitive and affirming. Children are happily involved in exploring their environment and communicating with their peers and teachers. Teachers welcome parents and families warmly in the centre, and communicate regularly with parents about children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is strengthened through positive and caring relationships with teachers.</p><p>There are collaborative and respectful working relationships among teachers and other adults at the centre. Teachers are beginning to work collaboratively with colleagues under the guidance of the new professional leader. These relationships are providing a good foundation for ongoing professional learning and development.</p><p>As most of the children are MƒÅori, it is important that leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>raise the visibility and presence of te ao MƒÅori practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the way MƒÅori children's culture, identity and language are evidenced in teaching interactions, the environment, the learning programme and children's individual assessments.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The following next steps need to be prioritised in the review and development of the centre philosophy, strategic and annual plans.</p><p>The development of a curriculum:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>that is more explicitly documented to identify curriculum priorities and emphases that are aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that includes well-defined processes for programme assessment, planning and evaluation that are used more effectively to inform ongoing centre development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that defines the place of tikanga MƒÅori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>shows how the centre programme reflects the language, culture and identity of each child.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playworx Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to self review, strategic planning and curriculum design. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>An agreed process of regular and ongoing self review for all centre operations, focused on identifying strategic priorities for improving outcomes for children, is implemented.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6].</em>¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>A process for effective, regular and ongoing staff appraisal is implemented. This needs to be aligned to the Practising Teacher Criteria of the Education Council New Zealand and focused on improving staff capabilities and outcomes for children.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7].</em>¬†</p>
</li>
<li>The service's curriculum acknowledges and reflects the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 43, C5].</em>¬†</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>The service's curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 43, C2.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playworx Kindy will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>29 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
