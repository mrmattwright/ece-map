</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Imagine Kids Care Huntly Early Learning Centre is a new, purpose-built centre located in Huntly. The owners also run another centre in Hamilton. The service provides a mixed-age programme for 55 children from 3 months to six years of age, including 15 up to the age of two. The centre has separate before and after-school, and holiday programmes, for children aged from 5 to 13 years of age.</p><p>The centre opened in November 2012 and has been recently relicensed for 55 children. The roll of 53 includes 41 children who are identified as MƒÅori. The majority have whakapapa links to Tainui.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes a mixed-age setting where tuakana-teina (learning with and alongside each other) relationships are encouraged. Relationships are nurturing and respectful. Children benefit from a spacious and well-resourced learning environment.</p><p>Managers and staff have been engaged in professional development using Te Whatu Pokeka, a kaupapa MƒÅori assessment for learning. This affirms the Te Ao MƒÅori (MƒÅori world view) cultural practices in the centre.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy places the child and their whƒÅnau at the heart of all practices, interactions and procedures. Managers and staff demonstrate the values of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga and manaakitanga - whƒÅnau, meaningful relationships and a culture of sharing. The philosophy recognises that children come with their own mohiotanga (knowledge and interests) that are valued and built on by the whƒÅnau and staff. The strategic plan provides a comprehensive framework for future direction and improvement, and is responsive to the aspirations of whƒÅnau.</p><p>In the short period since opening, managers and staff have established high standards and expectations for quality care and education for children. The centre provides a strong sense of belonging and support for children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre manager demonstrates effective, professional leadership and is responsive to and supportive of staff. There is open communication that supports a collaborative and collegial team culture. Effective performance management processes involve staff in goal setting, next steps for improvement, regular monthly monitoring of teaching practice, and six monthly interviews with the centre manager. Staff strengths are acknowledged and used to their full potential. The centre Manager has a good understanding of self review as a tool for development and improvement.</p><p>The centre programme is strongly grounded in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children have opportunities to learn and play in a spacious, well-resourced, warm and inviting environment based of the concept of the wharenui as a house of learning. Children can choose from a variety of learning and play activities, supported by their teachers.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is recorded in well-presented portfolios which they share with whƒÅnau. These records of learning are used by teachers to plan programmes for infants, toddlers and young children. Children‚Äôs individual identity is reaffirmed through the recording and learning of their pepeha, and their work displayed in their portfolios and on the centre walls. Teachers are beginning to include local history and MƒÅori mythology that is of significance to children and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Relationships throughout the centre are positive, affirming and supportive. Teachers work collaboratively to ensure that the centre programme is responsive to the needs, interests and aspirations of children and whƒÅnau. Children make choices in their learning and play, and benefit from well-known routines and smooth transitions provided by their teachers.</p><p>Children are confident communicators. Teachers respond appropriately to children‚Äôs verbal and non- verbal communication. Literacy and mathematical concepts are introduced through meaningful play, waiata, equipment, and games that provide challenge and fun. A range of mathematical resources and teaching strategies support children‚Äôs growing knowledge and awareness of mathematical concepts.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is used and spoken by teachers, children and whƒÅnau throughout the progamme. WhƒÅnau expertise and community resourcing contributes to the valuing of MƒÅori language and culture.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers discussed the areas for further development and improvement. Centre managers agree that these are:</p><ul>
<li>to strengthen self-review practices to effectively focus on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>for teachers to increase their knowledge and range of teaching strategies to extend children‚Äôs interests and thinking skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Imagine Kids Care Huntly Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Imagine Kids Care Huntly Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>30 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
