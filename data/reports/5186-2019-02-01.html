</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Mill Crescent is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Mill Crescent is located in the rural township of Matamata. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. Currently there are 40 children enrolled, 14 of whom identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy places value on children learning through child-led play and through caring, kind and respectful interactions. Teachers value the importance of upholding the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi of partnership, protection and participation.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and since the 2015 ERO review they have further improved appraisal processes and introduced into the learning programme local MƒÅori stories of significance.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten has established an inclusive culture that reflects the values of whƒÅnaungatanga and manaakitanga. Caring and trusting relationships among teachers, children and their whƒÅnau foster a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for all.</p><p>Children‚Äôs confidence and competence as life-long learners is supported and encouraged by teachers. Teachers use a wide range of effective teaching strategies that encourage children to problem solve, reflect, be creative and set their own challenges. They keep up-to-date with current theory and research and regularly reflect and inquire into their own practice. Teachers notice children‚Äôs interests and respond with intentional conversations to extend thinking and learning. Children are well supported to develop their confidence and to experience success in learning.</p><p>The kindergarten has a well-designed curriculum to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Strengths are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Children with additional needs who receive individual planning in collaboration with specialists and parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intentional teaching and planning to ensure equitable participation in the programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas that are interwoven into daily learning experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers who work in partnership with whƒÅnau as well as inviting their engagement in professional development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The curriculum that is responsive to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten's bicultural curriculum is developing. Teachers implement some te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori practices. They have introduced practices that incorporate historical stories from the area. Teachers intend to further develop practices that promote MƒÅori language, culture and identity to support MƒÅori to experience successes in learning as MƒÅori.</p><p>Leadership is focused on promoting positive outcomes for children and their families. Teachers have a shared understanding of the philosophy values. They have established collaborative ways of working together in partnership with parents. Assessment practices show children's progress over time and is responsive to parent's aspirations for their child‚Äôs learning. A well-developed internal evaluation process successfully promotes ongoing improvement and children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and Trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning, wellbeing and that of their whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to formalise personalised planning practices for all children that cater for their individual interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to further strengthen practices that support language, culture and identity, particularly for MƒÅori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Mill Crescent completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice Central Kids Kindergartens management needs to ensure observations of teacher practice are undertaken as part of the appraisal process.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Mill Crescent will be in three years.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>1 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
