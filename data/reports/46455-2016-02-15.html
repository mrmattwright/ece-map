</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Iqra Educare is a multi-cultural, multi-religion, multi-race community education and care centre located on the same site as the Hamilton Mosque. It is licensed for 30 children over two years old. The centre opened in May 2014 as a service for children from migrant and refugee families who would not otherwise have had the opportunity to benefit from pre-school learning and social experiences. Children come from a number of nationalities and cultures, and most are from non-English speaking families. They learn and play in a family-like, mixed-age setting. Currently there are no MƒÅori or Pacific children on the roll. This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO report.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board operating on behalf of the Waikato Muslim Association (WMA). Board members have a range of relevant skills and experience to enable them to effectively govern the centre. The board sets the direction for the centre and has appointed the centre manager who works with two other permanent teachers to implement the programme. All staff are registered and qualified.</p><p>Iqra Educare‚Äôs philosophy states that the centre aims to provide holistic care for individual children and a high standard of education based on Islamic beliefs and values. There are emphases on co-constructing learning experiences with children and families, acknowledging MƒÅori as tangata whenua, and promoting respect and self esteem. It is intended that the centre will be a safe, age-appropriate environment, where tamariki are delighted and extended. Children are valued as competent, confident and connected learners who are rich in potential and capable of taking responsibility for their own learning. The centre‚Äôs values and beliefs are well reflected in the programme provided for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a very caring and unhurried atmosphere where families from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to learn together. Relationships among children, teachers and parents are based on genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect and willingness to listen. Teachers continually foster children‚Äôs English language development. They intentionally tune into children‚Äôs interests and ideas, extend their vocabulary and conversation skills, and support problem solving. Teachers encourage reciprocal learning with children about their cultures and languages contributing to an active community of learners. Children and families steadily gain confidence as participants within the centre‚Äôs inclusive culture.</p><p>The high quality, child-led programme is enhanced by teacher input to scaffold learning, spark new interests and extend children‚Äôs experiences and knowledge. The curriculum includes appropriate opportunities for developing literacy, mathematics and science skills, and is also influenced by the partnership with the wider Muslim community. Well-considered, readily accessed resources and activities encourage children to participate in and initiate learning experiences. Bi-cultural practices include karakia, waiata, wall displays, and the use of tikanga and te reo MƒÅori. The children also learn Islam blessings and English prayers of thanks. Positive behaviour and guidance are modelled by teachers and imitated by children. Parents are actively encouraged to participate in children‚Äôs transitions into the centre and teachers support parents to participate in the process of transitioning to school.</p><p>The learning environment is welcoming and print-rich to foster language development. Resources and displays effectively reflect children‚Äôs learning interests. The programme and centre values are visible in attractive wall displays that promote discussion among children and their parents. The outdoor area is well designed to maximise space and provide opportunities for social play, gardening, exploration and physical development.</p><p>Children‚Äôs individual, attractive profile books include regular assessments, which identify their interests and learning experiences, and are presented with regard for parents‚Äô understanding of English. Profile records acknowledge the language and culture of individual children and promote opportunities for parents to contribute comments. Information from assessments is used to plan and develop learning experiences that meet the needs of individual children.</p><p>Teachers have sound professional knowledge. The centre manager works effectively and collaboratively with staff, parents and governing board members to implement the philosophy, strategic plan and special character values expected by the WMA. She reports comprehensively to the governing board through informal discussions and monthly written reports. Professional development is based on individual teacher‚Äôs development goals. Self review is focused on improving teaching, learning and positive outcomes for children. The appraisal process is being revised to meet recently introduced national requirements.</p><p>The centre manager and other staff members regularly visit families in their homes to develop positive relationships and share information about early childhood education. They work with the board to support migrant and refugee families to integrate successfully into the New Zealand way of life.</p><p>The board governs effectively. Board members reflect on their performance and are committed to providing the best possible early childhood education for all children who attend the centre within the expectations of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and the centre‚Äôs special character. Board members are actively involved in the life of the centre to support teachers and families in continually improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the board and centre manager agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment practices that more explicitly demonstrate the children‚Äôs learning and development over time and more explicitly make use of contributions from parents and children about their learning</li>
<li>further develop the staff appraisal process according to recently revised NZ Education Council regulations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Iqra Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Iqra Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
