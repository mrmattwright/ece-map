</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Village Preschool is a privately owned and operated centre in Paerata, just north of Pukekohe. It opened in 2014 and provides all-day care and education for children from two years to school age. The centre is licensed for 27 children and the current roll of 31 includes 10 Māori children. A centre manager provides overall professional leadership and is supported by a head teacher.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes an environment where children can freely explore, create and connect with the outdoors. There is a commitment to get to know families and build children's self-esteem to become confident and capable learners. The centre is welcoming to children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a broad curriculum with a particular emphasis on the natural environment. There is a focus on teaching sustainable practices which includes helping to care for the gardens and centre animals. The programme is a combination of teacher-led and child-initiated activities. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into children's play.</p><p>The centre manager is continuing to build positive partnerships with local schools to support children as they transition to school. Children learn in a well-resourced and settled environment where parents are encouraged to participate and share their knowledge. Relationships are cooperative and respectful between older and younger children. There is a strong sense of well-being and belonging for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers know the children well. They actively work alongside children, supporting them to persist with their play and learning. Children's interests are followed and extended through teachers valuing what they bring to their learning. Teachers regularly refresh the learning environment making it attractive and interesting for children. They are committed to integrating te reo and tikanga Māori into their daily programmes and have set goals to deepen their understanding of te ao Māori. Teachers use appropriate teaching strategies to identify and assist children who need extra support to make progress. These responsive teaching practices contribute to children's development as capable learners.</p><p>Children's individual portfolios provide an attractive record of their experiences and are readily available for them to revisit and share with their parents. Teachers are continuing to develop their assessment capability to show children's progress over time.</p><p>The centre manager is experienced and knowledgeable. She provides very effective guidance and professional support to teachers, in particular modelling effective teaching practice. There is a strong focus on building teacher capability. Internal evaluation systems are well established and inform teaching and learning and centre operations. It is a safe environment for children. The centre's comprehensive strategic plan is providing clear direction for the service. It is strongly focused on developing systems to meet the centre's philosophy. The plan underpins the provision of a quality learning programmes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leader agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consolidate shared understandings around effective teaching, including assessment practices to show children's learning and progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the visibility of children's language, culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Village Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Village Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>10 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
