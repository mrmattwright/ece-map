</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hinuera Playcentre, near Matamata, provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre operates under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association (EWPA) and is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 under two years. There are 33 children enrolled, including two Māori. Children can attend an all-day session on Mondays and morning-only sessions for the rest of the week. The playcentre employs two qualified supervisors to cover all sessions.</p><p>The centre aims to enhance the learning and development of each child by providing a caring, safe and stimulating environment that is focused on individual children's interests and needs. Parents are committed to children learning through play, within a supportive family friendly rural environment.</p><p>Two parents have recently been appointed as co-presidents and the other committee positions have been filled by parents new to the playcentre. Recent enrolments of younger children have resulted in a stronger focus on provision of education and care for children under two years of age.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the centre has made limited progress in the key next steps related to bicultural practice, extending children's learning and consistency of assessment documentation. In addition, the EWPA has yet to put appraisal systems for supervisors into place.</p><p>The NZPF is currently undergoing restructuring and this has implications for EWPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the EWPA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents maintain a welcoming environment, with a strong sense of belonging and community for both children and adults. Children readily explore a wide range of resources and activities. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into children's exploration and play. Children play and learn in a mixed-age group. The resulting tuakana-teina interactions, where children of all ages learn alongside one another, enhance outcomes for all children. </p><p>Children visit the neighbouring school and participate in various events. These strong connections are effectively supporting children's transition to school. Excursions into the wider community are a feature of the programme. Children benefit from a supportive, cooperative community where parents are actively involved as their first teachers.</p><p>Children enjoy warm, caring relationships with all parents. They are able to follow their interests or engage in authentic and interesting parent-led activities. Infants and younger children benefit from participating in the programme where they are well supported by their parents. Children's social competence is encouraged, which enables them to interact constructively and develop strong friendships with one another. ERO observed some examples of parents engaged in high quality interactions with children to extend their thinking. These members provide effective modelling for others at the playcentre. Children are well settled and engage in sustained learning in a physically and emotionally supportive environment.</p><p>There is some visibility of te reo Māori in wall displays and members are working to increase the everyday use of te reo Māori. Parents agree there is a need to further develop the way te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Easily accessible individual profile books record individual and group activities, and some dispositions. Useful playcentre templates encourage parents to include learning outcomes for children and possible next steps to extend interests. A more consistent approach to the quality and frequency of assessments is needed to more successfully identify individual children's progress and development, and plan next steps for learning.</p><p>Parent education has continued as many members participate in playcentre courses through other associations. Members benefit from the input of two parents trained in early childhood education. The EWPA provides useful policies and procedures for centre management. There is a need to improve communication and support for the centre provided by the Playcentre Federation and the local association. It would also be beneficial to provide ongoing training for newly appointed committee members to build their knowledge of management and children's learning. It is important to support parents' commitment to providing a supportive, effective service.</p><p>Members informally review the daily programme and centre organisation. There continues to be a need to develop self-review processes to evaluate the curriculum and how effectively the service is promoting best learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is a need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>self-review capability and systems in order to continually improve the quality of practice and promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>the consistency of the quality and timeliness of assessments to identify children's learning and progress, and use this information to guide planning</li>
<li>parents' confidence and capability to broaden and deepen bicultural practice across the curriculum, including local iwi history and stories. This should develop the identity of Māori children in the centre more fully and provide non-Māori children with a better understanding of the rich cultural heritage of New Zealand.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the EWPA supports the committee to develop and implement a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.  </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hinuera Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet the requirements EWPA must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the employed supervisors are regularly appraised by a suitably experienced and knowledgeable appraiser in order to affirm areas of good practice and identify areas for further development<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]<br> <br> </em></li>
<li>safety checks of supervisors are carried out every three years in order to meet the legal requirements for children’s safety and wellbeing.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7A; Vulnerable Children's Act 2014]</em><b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hinuera Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>11 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
