</table><p>Footsteps Christian Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Footsteps Christian Community Preschool is a non-profit centre. It is governed by a Trust and management board made up of leaders from the Seventh Day Adventist Church, parents and centre managers. It operates on a non-denominational basis.</p><p>The centre is managed by long-serving education and business managers. Its Christian philosophy underpins planning, learning and centre operations. Many of the positive aspects of the centre's programmes and practices noted in the February 2013 ERO report continue to be very evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The preschool provides children with a nurturing environment that successfully promotes their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Features of this environment include:</p><ul>
<li>positive, sensitive and responsive relationships between staff and children and respectful relationships between children that foster cooperative play</li>
<li>inclusive practices that affirm children‚Äôs differing cultural backgrounds</li>
<li>predictable routines and supportive interactions that encourage children to take appropriate risks to extend their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management and staff successfully foster positive relationships with parents and whanau. A welcoming environment and good communication help to create a family-like atmosphere.</p><p>The centre's curriculum clearly reflects its philosophy and special character and promotes positive outcomes for children. Strengths of the curriculum include the:</p><ul>
<li>strong focus on building on children‚Äôs interests</li>
<li>good mix of structured group activities and opportunities for child-led play</li>
<li>thoughtful integration of literacy, mathematics, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, science and music along with a variety of physical and creative play.</li>
</ul><p>Purpose-built facilities and the physical environment, along with a variety of readily accessible resources, invite children to explore and become fully involved in a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers actively support children‚Äôs involvement in exploratory play. This helps children to enjoy success and learn new things. Their support through ongoing discussions, involvement in play and skilful questioning helps to engage children and extend their thinking.</p><p>Teachers are making ongoing improvements to their assessment practices. Children's profile books are regularly updated, attractively presented and valued by them. Assessments are helping teachers to better recognise and respond to individual children‚Äôs interests and needs.</p><p>The education manager provides active centre leadership. This leadership has been critical to the success of the centre. She effectively promotes the centre‚Äôs special character and works collaboratively with the business manager. She has developed a culture that fosters trust, teamwork, pastoral care and a strong focus on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Strategic planning and ongoing self review promote improvements to specific aspects of the centre‚Äôs programme and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To help further enhance centre programmes and practices, managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>further develop group programme planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>develop a more clearly defined professional development programme using current research</li>
<li>extend the delegation of curriculum leadership responsibilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Recommendations</h3><p>Further update child abuse and appointment policies and procedures to meet all the requirements of the Vulnerable Children‚Äôs Act 2014.</p><p>Extend appraisal records in ways that provide clearer evidence that practices meet all the requirements of the Education Council.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Footsteps Christian Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>29 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
