</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Marewa Kindergarten in Napier provides early childhood education and care for up to 43 children aged over two. Morning sessions cater for three-year-olds and older children attend six hour sessions. The current roll is 54 children, including 8 M&#257;ori children.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operations of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association with support of the general manager. Two educational managers have a responsibility to build teacher capability. The very experienced head teacher provides professional leadership to a long serving teaching team. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Matauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao M&#257;ori. He demonstrates a clear vision for M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Positive relationships between the parent community and staff are evident. A focus on positive relationships and literacy remain central to the curriculum. Since the October 2012 ERO review some progress in teachers&rsquo; use of self review is evident. The recently expanded outdoor area provides children with greater opportunities for increased physical activity and play.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The kindergarten philosophy expresses the importance of secure and warm relationships between children, families and staff. A calm and settled environment enables children to play individually and in groups. There is a focus on building independence and resilience in a well-organised and resourced kindergarten. Increased teacher inclusion of parent aspirations contributes to learning partnerships with families. Children engage in sustained play.</p>
<p>Children participate in a child-centred and led curriculum. Teachers empower children to make choices in play. Literacy is actively encouraged through a love of books and conversations that support oral language. Children enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, self manage and are encouraged to have extended conversations. Younger children&rsquo;s transition into the kindergarten is well managed.</p>
<p>Portfolios are an attractive photographic record of children&rsquo;s participation in kindergarten activities and contain some informative learning stories. Individual planning for children requiring support is developing well. Recent professional development in assessment contributes to a greater awareness of the need to continue to improve teacher assessment, planning and evaluation to support improved outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Teachers plan to participate in professional development in te ao M&#257;ori. Association expertise and support are valued and sought to improve bicultural understandings and practices. Increased use of the kindergarten environment to reflect M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity is planned for.</p>
<p>Teachers assist families and children to prepare for their transition to school. Processes for working with an increased range of schools are in place.</p>
<p>A very experienced head teacher provides measured professional leadership to a long serving teaching team. She models high expectations for teachers to lead through following their interests and strengths. The team benefits from access to a suitable range of professional learning and research opportunities.</p>
<p>Teachers are becoming more confident in their use of self review to support ongoing developments. They are better able to see where they need to go to next to improve the quality of teaching and learning. Appraisal has further developed and there is an expectation for improvement in practices.</p>
<p>The association empowers teachers to use the team strengths to respond to their children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes that effectively build teacher capability. This includes self review, assessment, planning, evaluation, appraisal and leadership development.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should continue with planned developments to improve:</p>
<ul><li>bicultural practices and strategies to support success as M&#257;ori</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation practices through the planned curriculum review</li>
<li>the scope of self-review practices and the evidence used to evaluate the impact on outcomes for children</li>
<li>the appraisal process including goal-setting, sources of evidence, ongoing feedback and next steps to better evaluate its impact on children&rsquo;s outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Marewa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Marewa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices/PART-4-ERO-s-Framework-for-review-Nga-Pou-Here"> Ng&#257; Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
