</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waihopai Playcentre is parent led and provides two sessions each week for children up to school age. The sessions are led by an experienced, paid supervisor with the help of members.</p><p>Playcentre parents are gaining Playcentre qualifications by being involved in the adult-education training programme provided by the Southland Playcentre Association (SPA).</p><p>The SPA is experiencing a time of change as all playcentre associations throughout New Zealand merge with the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) to reduce duplication and make cost savings. This restructure will mean significant changes at the local association level.¬†An interim board is being established at SPA to support playcentres through this transitional period.</p><p>The October 2013 ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development. These included: supporting children and families for their move to school; reducing documentation workload for parent members; philosophy review; and strengthening strategic planning. These have been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 in the Southland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre philosophy is strongly evident in practice. Parents learn alongside their children. They model respectful relationships and positive interactions. Children share and collaborate. They are confident explorers and show care and concern for one another. Infants and toddlers learn alongside their older friends.</p><p>Most adults notice, recognise and respond appropriately to children's interests and previous learning. More experienced playcentre parents model assessment practices for newer members. A revised approach to assessment has recently been introduced to better support parent participation. Members should continue to embed this approach to promote consistency in assessment practices.</p><p>Warm, responsive and reciprocal relationships are a strength of the playcentre. Parent members are supportive of one another and are involved in all children's learning. Team work is highly evident.</p><p>Children and adults are warmly welcomed into the playcentre in a gradual, unhurried manner. They are encouraged to settle at their own pace. A useful range of strategies supports older children and families as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Bicultural practices are evident in routines, resources and cultural celebrations. Members recognise a need to strengthen this approach across playcentre programmes and to further develop their understanding of supporting MƒÅori children's learning. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>Self review for improvement is ongoing and has led to positive change. The focus for internal evaluation has recently progressed from how adults can solve a problem to how well the curriculum and teaching practices are supporting improved outcomes for children. Parent members should continue to strengthen this approach.</p><p>The board has been proactive in developing processes to assist in the smooth transition for playcentres to work under the NZPF. Opportunities have been offered to playcentre members to engage with SPA to consider how they can best support services through the impending restructure.</p><p>The board has identified a number of systems and processes have lapsed and need improvement. Immediate attention is required to review policies that guide the appointments procedure and health and safety practices. The appraisal process has also lapsed, or not been robustly implemented. These improvements are a priority to meet licensing criteria, and for monitoring the quality of centre practices.</p><p>More consistent, timely and evaluative reporting should be provided to the board to assure them that accountabilities are met and to better inform their decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The playcentre supervisor and members agree areas for strengthening include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing members' knowledge and understanding of bicultural practices and of supporting MƒÅori children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to promote consistency in assessment practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for the association are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review SPA policies, giving priority to those related to appointments and health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-establish the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>facilitate the evaluative reporting to the board.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waihopai Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO also identified areas of non-compliance for the Southland Playcentre Association in relation to governance and management. To meet requirements the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve practice the Southland Playcentre Association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure policies and procedures for travel by a motor vehicle clearly specify the person responsible for excursion approvals has verified all drivers have a current full New Zealand driver licence and each vehicle is registered and has a current warrant of fitness.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waihopai Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 April 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
