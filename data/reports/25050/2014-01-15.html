</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puffing Billy Daycare Centre is a well established privately-owned service in Takanini. The centre operates from a remodelled house and provides full day care and education for children from infancy to school age. It also provides before and after-school care. The centre‚Äôs licence now caters for up to 60 children, including up to 10 children under two years. Most children attending the centre are of MƒÅori or Pacific descent.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report noted that children played cooperatively with their peers and benefited from the family atmosphere of the centre and the consistently warm and respectful interactions teachers had with children. These affirming features continue to be evident in the centre.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report also recommended that managers and staff continue to focus on improving self-review practices and further develop their skills in planning, assessment and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy outlines the intentions of the centre and is recognised as an important guide for staff. The philosophy clearly embraces Te Tiriti o Waitangi and acknowledges the cultural partnership that is part of New Zealand.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships between teachers, children and their parents/whƒÅnau give children and their family a sense of belonging. Staff know families well and provide support and understanding when needed. The manager anticipates that the re-established parent committee will provide opportunities for parents to contribute to centre operations and programme planning. The management team have also identified the need to further strengthen partnerships with local iwi and marae.</p><p>Children engage in play and freely choose their activities between play areas. They cooperate with peers and benefit from meaningful conversations with teachers. Children are familiar with their surroundings and centre routines. The spacious outdoor environment encourages exploration and provides opportunities for physical challenges. The centre now needs to ensure that the learning environments continue to provide opportunities for children to revisit their play.</p><p>Babies and toddlers benefit from secure and nurturing relationships with teachers. They enjoy opportunities to explore the indoor and outdoor learning environments. Programmes specifically supporting individual children‚Äôs learning and development were most apparent in this area for younger children.</p><p>An inclusive centre culture is evident. Teachers work closely with children. Their knowledge of children‚Äôs culture and context contributes to positive learning outcomes for children. Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn about literacy and numeracy in their everyday experiences. Teachers are confident in using te reo MƒÅori throughout the day. This natural inclusion helps to highlight for children and families the value placed on MƒÅori language and culture in the centre.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guides the programme. A new initiative for planning, assessment and evaluation has been introduced and this is leading to a more child-led programme focus. Transitions into and within the centre, and on to school are considerate of children‚Äôs needs. Teachers are initiating ways to further strengthen their relationships with local schools.</p><p>The centre is developing a new governance and management structure which will see responsibilities shared among staff. Making this information available in the centre will enhance the capability of staff and contribute to ongoing sustainability. Centre management is in the process of evaluating all policies. The management team have investigated a number of self-review processes and are now in a position to refine and strengthen their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the management team have identified that in order to enhance positive outcomes for children, the centre manager and teachers should determine a strategic direction that is aligned to the current philosophy. They discussed the advantages of:</p><ul>
<li>developing a common, shared vision with staff, parents/whƒÅnau and children by implementing strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>including more consultative processes within self-review practices and making this information readily available in the centre</li>
<li>better aligning teacher performance appraisals with the registered teacher criteria and better linking appraisal to strategic planning and professional development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puffing Billy Daycare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Puffing Billy Daycare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 January 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
