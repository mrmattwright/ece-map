</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Takapuna Private Pre-school is an all-day education and care service in the grounds of the North Shore Hospital, in the Auckland suburb of Milford. Families who use this service are mostly hospital employees. It is licensed for a maximum of 50 children, including up to 20 aged under 2 years. There are 46 children enrolled currently, representing a range of cultures. The centre has three linked rooms called Pipi, Tuatua and Paua, to provide age-related care and learning experiences. Each has an outdoor space. The centre philosophy is strongly influenced by the "Virtues Project", and by established and well known early childhood approaches such as Pikler and Reggio Emilia.</p><p>The service has operated for many years and has a history of positive ERO reports. A new owner has now been in place for six months, and the new centre manager and seven teachers were all appointed within the last year. The majority of teachers are qualified, and all staff are now permanent and full-time. Team leaders oversee the day-to-day programme for each room. In a short period of time, the leadership team has reviewed and enhanced many aspects of centre operations, and has included staff and whānau in a strategic and collaborative approach to improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new centre philosophy is highly evident in the programme and practice. Respectful and supportive relationships are a key feature, and all staff prioritise children's wellbeing. The environment is warm, nurturing and welcoming for children and whānau. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpins teaching and learning. The "Virtues" of kindness, caring and respect are highly evident. Teachers respect children's choices and preferences, and view them as competent and confident learners. Children have space and time to make decisions, to express their needs, and to explore the centre at their own pace. A deep sense of belonging is purposefully fostered.</p><p>Children are highly engaged and motivated, learning through play and routines. They initiate and lead their play. There is a calm and settled tone, modelled and affirmed by teachers along with a strong sense of fun and enjoyment in discovery. Leaders have invested in good quality resources, promoting exploration, physical challenge and creativity. Interior environments provide authentic learning experiences with real objects and natural materials, and staff are working to enhance the outside areas. The arrangement of resources, and teachers' comments and questions, provoke children's curiosity and extend their thinking. Trips, and visits from experts also enrich children's interests.</p><p>Teachers have created a statement for each room that aligns with the centre's vision, values and philosophy. Each room has a distinct culture and programmes that are highly supportive of children at different stages of development. As teams continue developing their specific room philosophies and approaches, leaders acknowledge it will be necessary to ensure that consistency between rooms is maintained, supporting smooth transitions for children. The new team leader roles, and regular meetings to discuss practice, will also support this ongoing review.</p><p>Babies and toddlers under two are well supported by designated primary caregivers, who are attuned to each child's holistic needs, providing children with comfort and a sense of security. These youngest children build close, trusting relationships with adults and peers, and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and confidence. Like their older peers these children are also highly engaged in learning through play and well known routines. Teachers are very responsive to their developing verbal and non-verbal communication.</p><p>Teachers regularly complete attractive and useful records of children's play and learning in individual portfolios. These journals effectively demonstrate individual children's interests, strengths and needs. Teachers consistently identify key learning and explain why this may be significant in the child's development. Children freely and frequently access these records and enjoy revisiting and reflecting on their activities. Leaders are now keen to enhance the use of these records in planning and assessment, so that all teachers identify possible ways to support children's next steps in learning.</p><p>Tikanga Māori and authentic bicultural practices are naturally woven through the programme. The centre has established links with the local marae, and with the hospital's kaumatua. Te reo Māori is used in conversation, waiata, karakia and centre routines. Pepehā are included in learning portfolios. Parents and whānau are asked about their child's cultural connections and iwi. All children have a family picture book that they often look at, creating a link with home. Centre leaders have prioritised externally-facilitated professional development for teachers to enhance this bicultural dimension.</p><p>Teachers engage with whānau to find out about their aspirations for children's learning and development and to share curriculum planning and assessment. There is an innovative on-line portal that allows two-way communication between parents and teachers about children's learning and experiences. Many whānau contribute their ideas and engage in their children's learning in this way. Parent information evenings give parents further insights into the centre programme and philosophy. Strong communication and support enhances learning partnerships with parents.</p><p>Centre leaders have effectively established a foundation for building high quality practice. Strategic and annual planning prioritises centre goals and is underpinned by self review. Professional development is valued and an appraisal process has now been implemented. Regular meetings are held to discuss practice and to share overall progress in programme development. Teachers are using self review to refine transition practices, with improved links with local schools and pre-schools. This is providing staff with opportunities to forge useful professional learning connections.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders should continue to refine, embed and review new systems, procedures, and practices that enhance outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Takapuna Private Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Takapuna Private Pre-School will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
