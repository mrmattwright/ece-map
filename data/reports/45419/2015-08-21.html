</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Leaps and Bounds Albany offers full day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre caters for up to 125 children, including a maximum of 50 children under two. It is a purpose-built facility, with the premises organised into five rooms that cater for different age groups of children attending. The centre‚Äôs roll reflects its multicultural community.</p>
<p>Since its first ERO review in 2012, the centre has been bought by the Evolve Education Group (EVOLVE) and re named from New Shoots Albany to Leaps and Bounds Albany. The Evolve Education Group provides administrative and professional support. A centre manager leads the day-to-day centre operations. Team leaders have responsibility for care routines, teacher appraisals, and the programmes provided for children. Over 80 percent of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy statement is based on theories of learning which trust the child to be an explorer and self learner. It promotes respectful and trusting relationships, with a focus on building partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. The philosophy also recognises MƒÅori as tangata whenua and emphasises the importance of promoting children‚Äôs language, culture and identity.</p>
<p>Centre leaders have responded positively to suggestions for improvement identified in the 2012 ERO report. These suggestions related to further use of self review to enhance the quality of the centre‚Äôs teaching and learning practices.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Leaps and Bounds Albany caters very well for children. Children receive respectful care and are affirmed in their language, culture and identity. Children relate very well to each other and enjoy making choices about their play. They are supported to become independent, competent and confident learners. They enjoy helping each other and engage well in conversations with adults as they participate in centre activities.</p>
<p>The pace is unhurried and the programme invites children to explore. The welcoming environment encourages parents and children to feel a sense of belonging and enjoy their time at the centre. The programme promotes children‚Äôs learning, curiosity and celebrates their interests.</p>
<p>Good self review processes have led to positive changes in the programme and centre environment. There are high expectations for teaching and learning. A focus on developing children‚Äôs early literacy, numeracy and self management skills is appropriately woven into the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers know children and their families well and are focused on meeting their needs. Good systems allow teachers to manage their time well. Teachers work together to create a programme that is flexible, stimulating and responsive to children‚Äôs interests and needs.</p>
<p>Parents are encouraged to share their views and aspirations with teachers. This supports teachers to plan an appropriate programme for children. Effective communication keep parents well informed. Parents are invited to contribute their expertise to enhance the programme.</p>
<p>Families who have English as an additional language are provided with good support as their children transition into and through the centre. An effective transition to school programme, known as the Koru Club programme, has been developed. The centre-wide focus on children‚Äôs readiness for literacy and numeracy learning and the promotion of self management skills is particularly evident in the Koru Club programme.</p>
<p>The centre provides a curriculum that is focused on extending and developing children to be competent and confident learners. Teachers have established very good processes for planning, assessing and evaluating the programme. A curriculum advisor leads the development of the curriculum and implements centre-wide systems to support team leaders and teachers. The programme includes a bicultural focus. Teachers continue to review their practice and build their capacity to promote MƒÅori language and culture in the daily programme.</p>
<p>Effective leadership is a prominent feature of the centre. The centre manager sets high expectations for maintaining positive relationships with staff and families and for fostering positive outcomes for children. The smooth transition during the change of ownership process further reflects the effective leadership skills of centre management. The centre benefits from EVOLVE support through ready access to advice and guidance from the group‚Äôs professional services and business managers.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities for staff to build their capability through participation in internal and external professional development courses. The centre‚Äôs performance appraisal process also helps identify relevant new learning for teachers. Appraisal goals are well aligned to priorities documented in the centre‚Äôs strategic planning.</p>
<p>Self review is well understood by centre leaders and has been a major developmental focus for staff. Leaders ensure that staff and parent perspectives are reflected in reviews. A shared ownership of review outcomes is evident. Planned and spontaneous self reviews are well documented and lead to ongoing improvements.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps for further improvement include continuing to:</p>
<ul><li>review and refine centre practices for promoting an inclusive environment that responds effectively to the centre‚Äôs diverse community</li>
<li>strengthen and successfully embed changes in management systems introduced as part of the new ownership arrangements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leaps and Bounds Albany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Leaps and Bounds Albany will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
