</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>An Nur Childcare Centre is a Muslim centre providing care and education for Muslim and non-Muslim children. The centre is located in a diverse multicultural community. Children and families from the wider Christchurch area are given good support to enable them to attend.</p><p>The centre is the only early childhood Islamic centre in Christchurch. The teaching practices effectively incorporate the principles of Te WhƒÅriki, the New¬†Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, and foundations from the Islamic faith into the centre‚Äôs programme.</p><p>Teachers recognise and promote the wide range of languages, cultures, identities and understandings children bring from their home lives to the early childhood education experience. There is a strong focus in developing supportive partnerships in learning with parents and the wider Muslim community.</p><p>The centre is a charitable trust and provides professional educational guidance and support to other services throughout New Zealand to meet the needs of Islamic communities and their children.</p><p>The Canterbury Earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 have had huge impact on the centre. This includes significant staff changes, as teachers have left Christchurch and a reduction in numbers of children and families attending the centre. At the time of this review, a complete new teaching team, including a new head teacher, had recently been appointed. The number of children and families attending the centre is steadily increasing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a calm and peaceful learning environment. The centre philosophy and the Islamic language and culture are highly evident in centre practices and guiding documentation. This provides a consistent approach to everything that happens at the centre including routines, managing children‚Äôs behaviour and learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers gently guide children‚Äôs social learning in sensitive and appropriate ways. Children play well with and alongside others. They confidently share ideas and develop friendships.</p><p>Teachers show care and respect for one another and for children. They work with children in calm and unhurried ways that help to build secure and trusting relationships. Children relate well to adults and are confident that adults will listen to them and help them.</p><p>Teachers are making respectful links between the Islamic and MƒÅori cultures in ways that are meaningful to children. Children are well supported to develop a strong sense of belonging and cultural identity.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on extending children‚Äôs understanding and use of home languages and English. Teachers at the centre also come from a wide range of cultures. They are able to speak fluently with children in their home languages.</p><p>Whanaungatanga is an essential part of centre practices and shown in the way staff communicate and consult with parents and extended whƒÅnau. The centre provides education evenings for parents as well as celebrating significant cultural and social events with them.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their child‚Äôs participation in a range of individual and group learning experiences, significant events and excursions into the community. Information technologies such as Facebook, blogs and emails are used effectively to communicate and consult with parents and extended whƒÅnau. Teachers provide informative and well-presented learning stories about children, online and in individual profile books.</p><p>The centre manager has established efficient systems and processes that support staff in providing positive outcomes for children and families. She values and makes good use of the skills of all teachers and encourages a shared approach to leadership.</p><p>The process of self review is well understood by the centre manager and head teacher who work closely with teachers to promote the ongoing improvement of teaching and learning practices. They value and respond to the views of children and parents. Strategic and annual planning is well informed by self-review practices that support the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The new head teacher has been working with the new teaching team to strengthen the shared centre philosophy, teaching practices and documentation of children‚Äôs learning. The centre manager and head teacher have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a consistent approach to children‚Äôs assessment for learning and the ways teachers can add value to learning</li>
<li>more clearly show progress of children‚Äôs learning over time</li>
<li>make better use of individual assessment to inform programme planning</li>
<li>strengthen the evaluation of the impact of teaching strategies on children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Self review is well led by the centre manager and head teacher. They have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop guidelines to support all staff to better understand and use self review</li>
<li>strengthen appraisal and attestation by including use of the Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of An Nur Childcare Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of An Nur Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>13 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
