</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Balfour Playcentre is one of 19 governed by the Southland Playcentre Association (SPA). Children play and learn in a purpose-built facility on the Balfour School grounds. They enjoy the spacious indoor and outdoor areas in this rural setting. This is the only early childhood facility in Balfour. Neighbouring towns have other early childhood centres which some children from this playcentre also attend. The centre has established close connections with the school. Most children attend Balfour School at five years of age.</p><p>Since the 2006 ERO review, the centre has put strategies in place to improve their practice, especially in better recognising and planning for children‚Äôs learning and including a greater bicultural dimension.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 17 playcentres reviews in the Southland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p><em>Relationships.</em> Children benefit from positive and supportive relationships with each other and the adults in the centre. There is a strong sense of belonging amongst adults and children. The centre has received significant community support. New families are made to feel very welcome. The adults communicate well with one another and there are good systems to ensure that families are kept informed about the sessions and running of the centre.</p><p>Some children have close friendships with each other. Infants and toddlers are well integrated into the session. Adults work with the children in positive and encouraging ways. They are involved in the children‚Äôs play and are responsive to children‚Äôs requests.</p><p><em>Environment</em>. Children play and learn in well-resourced inside and outside areas. The centre‚Äôs philosophy is prominently displayed as a guiding document for parents. There are some prompts for te reo MƒÅori on walls. Children have easy access to resources that support their learning. Children are confident in the environment. They make choices about what they want to do and make good use of the resources. The outdoor area provides challenges for children‚Äôs physical skills, exploration and ball skills.</p><p><em>Learning.</em> Children of all ages enjoy a wide range of experiences. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a balance of child-initiated play and adult-planned activities</li>
<li>outings that are purposefully linked to the centre‚Äôs learning focus</li>
<li>regular baking as an opportunity for them to learn new skills and take turns</li>
<li>hearing the session leader use te reo MƒÅori.</li>
</ul><p>Older children have many opportunities to become familiar with the school environment through school assemblies, pet days and library and classroom visits. School-aged children visit the Playcentre from time to time.</p><p>Parents are dedicated to being their child‚Äôs first teacher and benefit from the training that the SPA offers.</p><p><em>Planning.</em> Planning is beginning to show a greater knowledge of how children learn. The pre and post-session discussions are thoughtful and show adults‚Äô awareness of specific children‚Äôs current learning steps and how they will provide for these throughout the session. The planning is made visible for all parents to support children other than their own and to see the planned daily experiences. There is a balance of group and individual planning. Records show there are close links with children‚Äôs home-life and the centre. Parents are very supportive of the session leader as she progresses through her training.</p><p>The strategic plan identifies what the priorities are and how these will be achieved.</p><p><em>Southland Playcentre Association support.</em> The SPA provides strong support to the playcentre through:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing adult education</li>
<li>twice termly visits by the playcentre liaison officer</li>
<li>property and maintenance advice</li>
<li>additional funding as required</li>
<li>help to meet relicensing requirements</li>
<li>a policy and strategic planning framework</li>
<li>sound governance practices.</li>
</ul><p>The SPA provides strong leadership to guide the future direction and ongoing improvement of all its centres. This includes the way association team members' foster emergent leadership. Currently there are high numbers of people participating in playcentre training. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that its next step is to improve its knowledge and understanding of self review. It then needs to support playcentres to implement effective self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre liaison officer and parents have identified that planning is work in progress. With the support of SPA, there is a need for the parents to decide what elements of the planning are the most useful and manageable for them to simply and clearly show children‚Äôs learning and progress.</p><p>Parents should continue to develop the MƒÅori dimension within the centre with the support of the SPA MƒÅori liaison officer.</p><p>The next step is for the session leader and parents is to develop their knowledge, understanding and use of self review to monitor the centre‚Äôs effectiveness in an ongoing way. They could also make better use of the centre‚Äôs strategic plan to guide the improvements that have already been identified. For example, lifting the quality of interactions and how they assess children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Balfour Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Balfour Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>30 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
