</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Massey Playcentre is located in a quiet residential area adjacent to a park. It has been dedicated to parents and children learning together for over 50 years. The parent led cooperative offers four sessions per week to children from birth to six years old. The centre operates under the organisational umbrella of the Te Akoranga Playcentre Association. A liaison worker and other elected Association officers provide support for the centre. Association members deliver the Playcentre adult education programme to help parents/whƒÅnau build their understanding about children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Massey Playcentre philosophy reinforces the value of parents/whƒÅnau and children learning with and alongside each other. Centre members promote the importance of developing a holistically confident child. They are aware of the need to maintain good levels of qualifications and have a high number of parents involved in training across all course levels.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted that children and families benefit from an inclusive and welcoming environment that supports learning opportunities for children in a mixed age setting. It also recognised that adults support children to play collaboratively and to make independent decisions about their play and social needs. These features continue to be evident throughout the centre.</p><p>Centre members have responded well to the recommendations in ERO‚Äôs 2012 report. They have explored ways to promote conversations that extend children‚Äôs learning and thinking and are continuing to strengthen documentation of children‚Äôs learning to inform programme planning and review. Centre members have addressed concerns identified in ERO‚Äôs 2012 report relating to hazards in the environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Massey Playcentre benefit from positive learning opportunities where they co-construct their learning alongside adults. Adults are skilled at providing appropriate guidance and assistance to extend children‚Äôs play. They are responsive to children‚Äôs preferences and cues and often promote tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Children enjoy a positive, well resourced environment. The large, natural area outdoors features established trees and grass slopes that provide many opportunities for exploration and physical challenge. This environment is complemented by the availability of the neighbouring park. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments. They make good use of the spacious indoor areas and large covered deck to play with their peers.</p><p>Centre members have a very good understanding of their role as facilitators of children‚Äôs learning. They display a good knowledge of Te WhƒÅriki, the early childhood curriculum, and provide opportunities for literacy and numeracy to be integrated throughout the programme. There is an emphasis on providing children with experiences to be creative and expressive. Centre members agree that they could consider further ways for children to revisit learning through their portfolios and access to displays.</p><p>Families know each other well and provide opportunities to celebrate each others‚Äô cultures. There is evidence of bicultural practices in the centre. Some sessions are well supported with te reo and tikangi MƒÅori. Adults now need to continue to develop this across all sessions.</p><p>Centre members bring varied skills and knowledge to their role at the centre. There is an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement for individuals and centre-wide systems. Adults are reflective and self review is both planned and spontaneous. Consultative processes help inform programme planning and improvements to the environment. A re-development of the entire outdoor learning environment is planned to commence this year. Adults agree to consider refining their self-review documentation in order to strengthen reflective practice.</p><p>Association management practices are well established. Good systems are in place to sustain quality practice and improve outcomes for children. A recent policy review has been completed and implemented. Centre members are encouraged to become involved in centre management and have opportunities to develop leadership skills. They are enthusiastic and committed to promoting the centre in the wider community. They uphold a child focus and endorse the importance of children‚Äôs play as essential for their holistic development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><h4>Centre members agree that the key next steps for the centre include:</h4><ul>
<li>embedding bicultural practices across all sessions</li>
<li>implementing the next development stage of the outdoor learning environment</li>
<li>researching how to effectively integrate science into the programme</li>
<li>strengthening relationships with local schools in order to promote smooth transitions for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Massey Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Massey Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
