<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres (Milford) is a well established service that caters for children up to five years of age in two adjacent centres; &lsquo;Babies and Toddlers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Preschool&rsquo;. The Kindercare group provides systems and personnel to support the management and operation of the centre. The organisation-wide philosophy and values provide a sound foundation for the programme.</p><p align="left">Infants and toddlers enjoy high quality care and benefit from a primary caregiver system that supports the development of close, trusting relationships. Teachers respectfully nurture children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging. Their calm, unhurried interactions result in a settled programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s own routines and preferences.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities for play and exploration both indoors and outdoors. Teachers know children well and sensitively respond to their play interests. A recent focus on enhancing teachers&rsquo; interactions in the outdoors has been successful.</p><p align="left">Teachers and families share information to plan for children&rsquo;s learning and development. Centre leaders and staff continue to consider the ways in which they cater for M&#257;ori children and engage with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori. Centre leaders also continue to support the development of the centre&rsquo;s bicultural curriculum.</p><p align="left">Experienced and able centre leaders and Kindercare personnel build the capacity and capability of staff. Individual strengths are acknowledged and utilised. Positive team work and a readiness to explore new initiatives support the development of teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">Centre review is focused on improving outcomes for children. Appropriate annual and strategic goals are developed collaboratively and progress is well tracked. Ongoing evaluation is resulting in a culture of reflection and improvement and has enabled managers and staff to build on the very good practices reported by ERO in 2009.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres (Milford) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKindercare Learning Centres (Milford).</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review of Kindercare Milford found that very good education and care was provided for children. The good practices identified at that time have been built on through the stability and commitment of centre leadership and staff.</p><p align="left">The Kindercare philosophy and values of &lsquo;safe, loved and learning&rsquo; provide a foundation to guide the programme and children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive relationships. Infants and toddlers enjoy high quality care and benefit from a primary caregiver system. Teachers are caring and responsive and work closely with children. They promote Kindercare values and provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing social and emotional competence. Respect and openness between managers and staff promotes effective teamwork and information sharing.</p><p align="left">Engaging parents/wh&#257;nau. A focus on engaging families is resulting in meaningful connections between the centre and children&rsquo;s families. Teachers make good use of parents&rsquo; aspirations as a starting point to plan for each child&rsquo;s learning. Parents&rsquo; views are valued and used to inform centre and programme development.</p><p align="left">Effective self review. The centre&rsquo;s internal review processes are well developed. Reflective practice is promoted and staff have opportunities to meet individually with managers. Their feedback helps to shape centre development priorities. All aspects of centre operation are evaluated in collaborative ways.</p><p align="left">Environments. The centre is well maintained and attractive. Inviting displays of resources and equipment appeal to children and are appropriate to their age. Children use resources in flexible ways to support their play. Teachers&rsquo; professional learning about enhancing environments is very evident.</p><p align="left">Programme management. Programme planning reflects children&rsquo;s interests and their next developmental steps. Individual portfolios are developed collaboratively and show children&rsquo;s learning and development over time. Teachers have good support to develop programme management practices and systems that reflect their individual skills and talents within a centre-wide framework.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Managers and ERO agree that the next steps for the development of teaching and learning include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing displays at children&rsquo;s eye level</li>
<li>giving greater prominence to science in the curriculum</li>
<li>utilising the Ministry of Education/ New Zealand Teachers Council document T&#257;taiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners as a means for developing teacher understanding about their engagement with M&#257;ori learners and their wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres (Milford) completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that managers continue to use their collaborative self-review practices to identify centre development priorities.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5.

The Kindercare group provides systems and personnel to support the management and operation of the centre. The organisation-wide philosophy and values provide a sound foundation for the programme.</p><p align="left">Infants and toddlers enjoy high quality care and benefit from a primary caregiver system that supports the development of close, trusting relationships. Teachers respectfully nurture children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging. Their calm, unhurried interactions result in a settled programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s own routines and preferences.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities for play and exploration both indoors and outdoors. Teachers know children well and sensitively respond to their play interests. A recent focus on enhancing teachers&rsquo; interactions in the outdoors has been successful.</p><p align="left">Teachers and families share information to plan for children&rsquo;s learning and development. Centre leaders and staff continue to consider the ways in which they cater for M&#257;ori children and engage with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori. Centre leaders also continue to support the development of the centre&rsquo;s bicultural curriculum.</p><p align="left">Experienced and able centre leaders and Kindercare personnel build the capacity and capability of staff. Individual strengths are acknowledged and utilised. Positive team work and a readiness to explore new initiatives support the development of teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">Centre review is focused on improving outcomes for children. Appropriate annual and strategic goals are developed collaboratively and progress is well tracked. Ongoing evaluation is resulting in a culture of reflection and improvement and has enabled managers and staff to build on the very good practices reported by ERO in 2009.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
