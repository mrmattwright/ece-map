</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Kawaha Point is located in Rotorua City. The centre is licensed for 32 children including eight up to the age of two. It provides all-day education and care, from birth to school age, in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy places priority on incorporating te aō Māori into the programme and working in partnership with parents and whānau to achieve positive outcomes for children. It also aims to provide a home away from home where children can embrace hands-on learning in a natural environment.</p><p>Since ERO’s last review in November 2014 a new teaching team and professional services manager have been appointed. Over the last three years there have been further developments to the learning environments and the centre strategic plan has been developed. All areas for development identified in the last ERO report have been effectively responded to.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart organisation which is owned by the Wright Family Foundation, a Charitable Trust. BestStart provides comprehensive policy guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management. Professional guidance and development for staff is provided through appraisal which includes teacher inquiry, internal reviews such as the quality education and care evaluation (QEC), and professional learning opportunities. Management also supports the implementation of the company and centre’s visions and strategic goals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>BestStart provides highly-effective governance for the centre. The key guiding document is the annual quality education and care (QEC) evaluation which drives a model of continual improvement. The QEC is a well-established aspect of self review that informs strategic and annual planning and identifies priorities for professional practice, centre operations and improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Leadership is highly effective. They have developed a shared passion throughout the team and community reflecting a strong commitment to the centre's philosophy and vision. Management demonstrates a high level of commitment to The Treaty of Waitangi. This is evident in centre operations and the promotion of bicultural practice for all teachers. Ongoing systematic professional learning and development promotes a collaborative, reflective culture. High levels of mutual respect and collaboration contribute to children’s wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The curriculum is culturally responsive and highly effective at promoting successful educational outcomes for children. Bicultural practice reflects the cultural competencies for teachers of Māori learners and underpins the strength of relationships amongst kaiako, whānau and tamariki. The programme skilfully incorporates te āo Māori, including developing its own kawa, pepeha and waiata. Kaupapa Māori concepts such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and kaitiakitanga are integral to curriculum decisions and experiences for children.</p><p>The daily programme allows children to make choices and engage in long periods of sustained and uninterrupted play. Independence and self-management skills are actively encouraged through responsive and flexible routines. A feature of the programme is its well-developed commitment to sustainability. Practices include reducing and recycling materials wherever possible. The widespread access to natural open-ended resources within the environment strongly supports opportunities for creativity, imagination and allows hands on real-life learning. Children experience many opportunities to develop respect for the natural world.</p><p>High-quality assessment practices reflect individual planning, based on the interests and strengths of children and the contribution and aspirations from parents. An online platform supports teachers in building learning partnerships with parents. Children benefit from assessment practise that provides a strong basis for teacher planning that extends and progresses children's learning.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and whānau are based on genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect, willingness to listen and to share fun. Teachers have developed a strong culture that supports participation by parents and families in the centre. They seek and value the knowledge and expertise of parents and whānau. There are many examples where whānau contribute to the programme and environmental developments.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. Children with additional learning and development needs and their whānau, are well supported through cooperation with external agencies. Children are viewed as competent and confident learners and experience an environment which fosters their resilience, independence, self-awareness and positive self-esteem as life-long learners.</p><p>Transitions into and from the centre are responsive to the needs of children and whānau. The centre has fostered a reciprocal relationship with the neighbouring primary school, which coordinates a weekly transition programme for children who are close to school age. Respectful practices, gentle and nurturing transitions allow very young children to feel settled and secure in a whānau-like environment. Babies explore throughout the learning environments, fostering opportunities for genuine tuakana/teina relationships with older children. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has confidence that centre leadership and management have the systems and capability to identify, progress and sustain high-quality practices and programmes. Areas already identified by centre leaders for ongoing evaluation and development include strategic planning and further strengthening kaupapa Māori assessment.</p><p>Managers recognise the need to strengthen the appraisal process by formalising observations of teachers’ practice, consistent with Education Council expectation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Kawaha Point completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Kawaha Point will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>20 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
