</table><p>Bottle Lake Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bottle Lake Preschool was established in 2015. It was previously ABC Tamara Park and ABC Rua Tamara Park. At the time of this review, there were two teachers from the previous centres.</p><p>The preschool caters for children from birth to school age in a nursery, preschool and kindergarten. Each led by a senior teacher.</p><p>During 2015, the licensee appointed new managers, head teachers and teaching teams. Most staff are qualified, permanent teachers and some who are training. Relievers who work for the service are very familiar with the centre's philosophy and know the children well.</p><p>The centre has been supported by a series of Ministry of Education led professional development. This has resulted in ongoing and major review of the philosophy, curriculum, planning, assessment appraisal and teaching practice.</p><p>This is the first review of Bottle Lake Preschool under its new owner.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships between children, parents, staff, and management have resulted in creating an environment with a strong sense of belonging. Parents' ideas and aspirations for their children are regularly sought, valued and included into children's learning. Staff are getting to know the children and their families well. There is a strong focus on children's and families' pastoral care and wellbeing.</p><p>Staff members are developing a shared understanding of the centre's new philosophy. The philosophy is closely aligned to the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum. The new philosophy is increasingly evident in teachers' practices. Children are given good opportunities to make choices and decisions about their learning. Older children play well together. The licensee, managers and teachers are reflective and inclusive of the cultures and communities within it.</p><p>Children's learning is well supported by teachers, who critically reflect on learning opportunities. The development of consistent and shared planning processes ensures children's interests, their ideas and parents' views are well-documented. Children and staff effectively use technology to support learning and communication with parents and families.</p><p>Children have a broad range of learning experiences. The environments and programmes in each age group effectively include a bicultural and multicultural focus and successfully integrate literacy and mathematics in activities and group times. Staff are making good use of parents and community members' knowledge and skills.</p><p>Children are involved and busy in the environment. Spacious indoor and outdoor areas, and a good range of resources, equipment and facilities promote children's independence and support them to investigate their ideas.</p><p>Transitions into, within and out of the centre are well planned. The head teachers and staff in the kindergarten part of the preschool, work closely with local primary schools. This collaboration has resulted in a programme, with expectations, that are likely to support children's needs when transitioning to school.</p><p>Children under two have individualised programmes involving their families. To best support infants' learning and development, the centre has sometimes placed extra staff in this area.</p><p>The centre has experienced significant change since opening. The licensee has been strategic in staff appointments so that their skills, knowledge and backgrounds support the centre's philosophy.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are building staff professional capability. A robust appraisal process supported by professional development, links with the centre's philosophy and strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre's philosophy, vision and strategic direction now needs time to be embedded. These documents are providing useful guidelines to support ongoing improvement. A stronger focus on goals to improve learning outcomes for children would strengthen the usefulness of these plans.</p><p>The licensee, managers and head teachers have identified that they will continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural aspects of the programme</li>
<li>consultation with whƒÅnau</li>
<li>consistent good quality assessment</li>
<li>the centres self-review process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bottle Lake Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bottle Lake Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
