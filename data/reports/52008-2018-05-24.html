</table><p>With targeted support from the association and the development of an action plan, Ashhurst¬†Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ashhurst Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, three sessions a week, in a mixed-aged setting. This includes provision for 15 children up to the age of two. At the time of this review there are 28 children enrolled.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation, of which Central Districts Association is part, is undergoing a significant restructure that includes amalgamating associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and others.</p><p>The¬†federation philosophy, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this, the centre philosophy fosters an emergent, child-led curriculum.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children. Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Each session is supported by a team of parent educators who hold Playcentre training certificates. The centre president is new to the role. During Term¬†4,¬†2017, a temporary supervisor and the centre support person provided some guidance to the president and the centre.</p><p>Centre support people visit playcentres to provide professional advice and support, and to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report of Ashhurst Playcentre identified areas for development for the association and the playcentre. These included: assessment, planning and evaluation practices; including local knowledge and history in the programme; implementing te ao MƒÅori through the curriculum; and effective support from management. Limited progress in addressing these areas is evident.</p><p>The review was part of a cluster of 11 reviews in the Central Districts Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Ashhurst Playcentre's philosophy needs to be reviewed to support a curriculum that is more responsive to the strengths, abilities, and needs of all learners.</p><p>Children explore and settle into activities of interest. They engage with other children and adults in the well-resourced environment. Independence is encouraged. Infants and toddlers are appropriately supported. Warm and affirming relationships assist children and families to develop a sense of belonging. Tuakana teina relationships are evident.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are visible in the environment and through daily rituals. Members are aware of the need to strengthen te ao MƒÅori practices to better support MƒÅori learners. This is confirmed by ERO's external evaluation.</p><p>The environment and children's portfolios are yet to clearly make visible what the centre values for its learners and for learning. Responsiveness to culture, language and identity is an area for further development.</p><p>Transition into the centre and on to school is supported through providing useful information about schools and participating in local school events. Reciprocal, well developed relationships are in place with local schools.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of children with additional needs. Adults have established links to agencies to provide strategies or support, when required.</p><p>Planned internal evaluation is in the early stages of development. Spontaneous review occurs with some positive changes made to improve the environment. A key next step is for the association to provide guidance and support to develop the internal evaluation capability and understanding of leaders and members. This development is needed to inform decision-making, improve the quality of practice and promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Members recognise that strategic and annual planning needs to be more focused on how adults plan to meet priorities for children's learning and goals towards achieving the playcentre's vision.</p><p>The association has a useful appraisal process. This is yet to be suitably implemented for teachers at centre level. As new policies and systems are implemented there is a need to communicate why these are relevant and how they are to be incorporated into practice at centre level. Support and guidance for session facilitators and members needs to be strengthened. The association should improve its monitoring to raise the quality and consistency of support provided to the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy to better guide and inform the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement all aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, including making visible children's culture, language and identity through documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote bicultural practice and educational success for MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop understanding and use of effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement meaningful appraisal for employees.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the association/federation level, priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>centre support that is consistently effective in identifying and responding to leadership and playcentre needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>members' understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the new regional team actively monitor and evaluate the quality of support provided to playcentres.</p><p>The service, with association support, will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ashhurst Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ashhurst Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>24 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">.</a></span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
