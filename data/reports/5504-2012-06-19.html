<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Richard Hudson Kindergarten is one of 22 early childhood services operating under the umbrella of Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). It is situated in the community of Caversham, South Dunedin. Most children attend for either morning or afternoon sessions. The kindergarten is committed to te ao M&#257;ori and has woven ecological sustainability into their programme, based primarily on a M&#257;ori perspective.</p><p align="left">Children and their families benefit from positive and caring relationships with the teachers. Parents and wh&#257;nau are made to feel welcome in the kindergarten. They are comfortable to share information about their children with the teachers. Teachers use a range of ways to communicate with parents about their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Children are enthusiastic and active participants in their learning. They play and learn well alongside and with each other. Children frequently hear and use te reo M&#257;ori throughout the session. Children learn sign language in group settings. The teachers and children have well-established routines and boundaries around expected behaviour.</p><p align="left">Teachers use effective strategies to support children&rsquo;s problem solving, thinking and learning. They have a wide range of useful group programmes including healthy living, sustainability, caring for gardens and animals. They build links for children with their community through a variety of events and activities. Teachers integrate numeracy and literacy well throughout the programme.</p><p align="left">The teachers are very reflective. They constantly look for ways to improve what they do and how they could better provide for their children. They have identified, and ERO agrees, that their next step is to develop and review their guidelines for planning and evaluating group programmes. This should help teachers to better support individual learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The kindergarten teachers suggested that within these areas the review could consider their group planning. The teachers identified that they want to review and develop their guidelines for group planning and evaluation of the learning. This should help teachers to better support individual learning.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Richard Hudson Kindergarten philosophy states that children are like young and tender plants. Teachers, parents, wh&#257;nau and caregivers are the loving and caring gardeners who nurture them, water them and support them so that they can grow into mighty and fruitful trees. They are committed to te ao M&#257;ori in everything they do.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The children learn and play in a programme which prioritises M&#257;ori perspectives. Teachers link this to care for self, others and the environment. Children frequently hear and use te reo M&#257;ori throughout the session.</p><p align="left">Children and their families benefit from positive and caring relationships with their teachers. Teachers seek and welcome parent and wh&#257;nau contributions to the programme, including sharing their talents and cultural celebrations within the kindergarten. Parents share meaningful information with the teachers about their children and feel comfortable to stay and settle their children. Teachers have developed a range of ways to communicate with parents about their child&rsquo;s learning including face-to-face, profile stories and a secure Facebook page.</p><p align="left">The children play and learn well together. They are enthusiastic and active participants in their learning. They are involved in sustained play. ERO noted other strengths that contribute to children&rsquo;s learning and well-being.</p><p align="left">These include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers&rsquo; use of effective strategies to support children&rsquo;s problem solving, thinking and learning</li>
<li>a wide variety of group programmes, for example, learning about healthy living, sustainability, caring for animals and gardens, and building links with the community.</li>
<li>integration of numeracy and literacy including sign language into the programme</li>
<li>well-established routines and clear boundaries about expected behaviour</li>
<li>good support from the DKA management team.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left"><strong>Planning for Learning.</strong> Teachers need to improve how they plan for individual children&rsquo;s learning. Planning needs to better show how teachers respond to parents&rsquo; priorities for their children. Planning also needs to better show what strategies teachers plan to use to extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers are very reflective and have identified that their next steps are to develop and review guidelines for planning and evaluating programmes to promote individual learning.</p><p align="left"><strong>Self Review.</strong> Teachers need to further develop their self-review practices to include indicators of best practice and a schedule for self review. This will help them to monitor the effectiveness of their systems, programmes and practices over time.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Richard Hudson Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Teachers use a range of ways to communicate with parents about their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Children are enthusiastic and active participants in their learning. They play and learn well alongside and with each other. Children frequently hear and use te reo M&#257;ori throughout the session. Children learn sign language in group settings. The teachers and children have well-established routines and boundaries around expected behaviour.</p><p align="left">Teachers use effective strategies to support children&rsquo;s problem solving, thinking and learning. They have a wide range of useful group programmes including healthy living, sustainability, caring for gardens and animals. They build links for children with their community through a variety of events and activities. Teachers integrate numeracy and literacy well throughout the programme.</p><p align="left">The teachers are very reflective. They constantly look for ways to improve what they do and how they could better provide for their children. They have identified, and ERO agrees, that their next step is to develop and review their guidelines for planning and evaluating group programmes. This should help teachers to better support individual learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
