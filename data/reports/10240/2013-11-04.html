</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Botany operates in premises on the first floor in the Botany Downs town centre. It is licensed to provide all-day care and education for up to 80 children. The owners have two Botany centres that are independent Lollipops franchises. The Lollipops organisation provides a policy and quality assurance framework for centre operations. The owners delegate day-to-day management to a centre director. A supervisor is responsible for curriculum planning and implementation in the centre and is one of three team leaders in the Babies, Supertots and Rising 5s rooms.</p><p>In 2011 the centre‚Äôs two licences on this site were merged. As a result, managers have been able to remove fences between the Supertots and Rising 5s outdoor play areas. This change provides more flexibility and supports improved transition between these rooms.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. ERO‚Äôs 2010 report recommended that teachers enhance programmes by involving children and whƒÅnau in programme planning and engaging in more extended conversations with children. The centre has responded positively to these suggestions.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2010 review, managers and teachers have reviewed the centre‚Äôs philosophy and have developed a strong focus on incorporating Reggio Emilia teaching and learning approaches.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Managers and teachers have established a strong sense of family and community. Staff and whƒÅnau appreciate the welcoming, inclusive atmosphere and caring relationships throughout the centre. Staff know children and their whƒÅnau very well.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience a good quality programme where interactions are warm and nurturing. They have access to a wide variety of resources. Children are well supported to settle when they arrive and to transition smoothly to other rooms.</p><p>Children have a sense of belonging and interact confidently with others. They happily engage in activities provided for them and are well supported to develop positive social relationships. Teachers encourage children to contribute their ideas about the day‚Äôs programme and activities.</p><p>Children‚Äôs literacy learning is well supported. Books, writing materials and computer technology are readily available and children‚Äôs stories are often recorded. Rising 5s teachers currently use a specific tool for promoting different styles of thinking. The centre director and supervisor agree that it would be beneficial to reduce the level of adult direction in this area and make better use of child-led conversations to support learning, independent reasoning and problem solving.</p><p>Teachers are committed to implementing programmes that reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. They often include te reo MƒÅori in appropriate ways and are keen to increase their confidence and understanding in this area.</p><p>Cultural diversity is a feature amongst the centre‚Äôs staff and families. This diversity is evident in displays and resources and children‚Äôs home languages are valued and included. Celebrating children‚Äôs bilingual abilities and cultural identity in assessment and planning records would enhance current good practices.</p><p>The centre makes effective use of its first-floor situation. The rooftop outdoor play area is well presented and resourced to provide appropriate physical challenges and exploration opportunities for children. Indoor environments reflect the Reggio Emilia focus on attractively presented displays and resources that provoke children‚Äôs curiosity and investigation. The surrounding community facilities are well used to expand children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>The centre benefits from effective management and leadership. The owners, centre director and supervisor support staff to engage in professional development and to take on leadership roles. A culture of continual self review has been established and contributes to ongoing improvement. Teachers‚Äô in-depth self review is based on research and professional dialogue. Managers regularly review progress against annual plans and use this information to adapt strategic planning.</p><p>With the support of an external adviser, managers and teachers continue to reflect on the effectiveness of their assessment practices. Teachers could make better use of their knowledge of individual children to plan programmes and be more responsive to children‚Äôs emerging interests and ideas. A clearer focus on identifying and improving learning outcomes for children would help teachers to better align their practices with the centre‚Äôs philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre director and supervisor have identified appropriate areas for ongoing development. Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing planning practices that are more clearly responsive to individual children‚Äôs strengths and interests and to parents‚Äô aspirations and input</li>
<li>continuing to build leadership capacity in the centre</li>
<li>continuing to build on existing very good self-review practices.</li>
</ul><p>The centre‚Äôs culture of reflection and collaboration provide a sound foundation for this ongoing development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Botany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Botany will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
