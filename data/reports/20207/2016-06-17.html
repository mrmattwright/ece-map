</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Princes Street Community Childcare operates in a heritage building backing onto Albert Park in the Auckland City CBD. It is licensed for 40 children including 14 aged under two years, and provides full day education and care programmes.</p><p>The service is governed by the Princes Street Childcare Trust Board. There have been significant changes to the governance, management and leadership of the centre in the past two years. A new trust board with six parent trustees was appointed in 2014, and leadership roles and responsibilities have been reviewed. The board employs a centre manager to lead a team of five qualified, full-time teachers.</p><p>The indoor learning areas have two separate dedicated spaces for children aged up to two years, and for older children up to school age. Other indoor spaces and the outdoor activity area are shared by the two age groups, which allows children to play for periods of time in mixed age groups.</p><p>The centre philosophy and vision guide and underpin all practices and developments at the centre. The philosophy is centred on building good relationships between whƒÅnau, teachers and children. The document is linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and emphasises the team‚Äôs commitment to bi-cultural practices and meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse community.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report acknowledged that teachers catered well for the learning needs of children but identified a number of areas that needed further work. The trust board and the teaching team have responded well to ERO's findings. Self-review processes have been strengthened, governance and management roles have been reviewed, and teachers have been supported to further develop programme planning. Ongoing work is in place to improve teachers' planning and assessment practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the well-resourced centre, and there is a warm, inclusive atmosphere in the centre. Children freely access a wide range of resources and have many opportunities to make choices about their play. They settle quickly, play well alongside each other and enthusiastically join in group learning activities.</p><p>Leaders' and teachers' focus on maintaining warm and respectful relationships with children and their families has contributed to the ongoing sense of community ownership. Unhurried parent and staff interactions help foster children‚Äôs sense of well-being and belonging. Parents express high levels of satisfaction with the centre and the staff. They value the inclusive, multi-cultural environment, and teachers' in-depth knowledge of their child's development, strengths and interests.</p><p>Teachers are attentive and responsive to the needs and preferences of infants and toddlers. Toddlers make choices and are encouraged to join in activities. They benefit from respectful nurturing care from teachers and opportunities for younger and older children to learn from each other.</p><p>Children engage well with their teachers and with the responsive and well-paced programme. Routines are unhurried and allow children time to sustain their interest in activities. The learning programme is well aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and integrates literacy and numeracy into play activities throughout the day. Children are encouraged to self-manage, initiate play with others, and build friendships. Developing these social skills and a strong relationships focus are woven through teachers' planning and should help children when they go to school.</p><p>Bicultural practices are strong. Te reo MƒÅori is interwoven naturally through the programme. Staff and children have opportunities to learn waiata and karakia. Centre programmes and practices also develop children‚Äôs knowledge and appreciation of other cultures and languages.</p><p>Teachers' planning recognises and responds to the interests and strengths of individual children well. Leaders have identified further refinements that are needed to improve planning and evaluation. Children‚Äôs individual learning progress is currently documented in portfolios. A new, online portfolio is about to be introduced. This will allow teachers to better document children's progress and learning outcomes, and to more easily share these with families.</p><p>The trust board and centre leaders provide worthwhile professional learning opportunities for all staff. A number of significant reviews have been carried out recently, and have informed the centre's strategic planning. The strategic plan provides a useful basis for reviewing centre progress. Leaders have ensured that staff have been fully involved in these reviews. Parent feedback has also been used regularly.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the rigour, quality and regularity of assessment</li>
<li>continuing to develop learning partnerships with parents through children's learning stories</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen teachers' deliberate reflection on the impact of their teaching on children's learning outcomes</li>
<li>reviewing the appraisal policy to reflect current centre procedures.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Princes St Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Princes St Community Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
