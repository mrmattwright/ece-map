</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glen Innes Playcentre in East Auckland is a well-established centre located next to Tamaki College. The centre is one of 14 centres in the Tamaki Playcentres Association and is licensed for 25 children, including 15 up to two years of age. It is open for three general sessions each week plus an established 'Big Kids' session for older children, which is run by paid supervisors.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the overarching Playcentre philosophy of whƒÅnau and children learning together in a fun, nurturing environment. High levels of parent involvement in training enable them to be the kaiako (teachers) who guide children's learning.</p><p>The Association provides a framework for centre management and operations, as well as parent education programmes and personnel to support centre members in their leadership, educator and parenting roles. Te Kimiora o Tamaki, the Association support group for whƒÅnau MƒÅori, provides members with advice and guidance regarding their bicultural practices.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa, the national organisation, is currently in the process of a comprehensive restructure. A regional hub will be established to provide governance, management and parent education support for Playcentres in central, east and south Auckland. While this will mean significant changes at the local Association level, it is expected that support for individual centres will be maintained or strengthened.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report noted centre members' collaborative approach to operating the centre. It also noted high levels of understanding about te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori, and strong connections with community. These good practices remain evident. Areas for further development at that time included aspects of self-review, strategies for planning programmes and extending children's learning. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Tamaki Playcentres Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playcentre philosophy is reflected very well in the programme for children and the centre culture. Very committed Playcentre parents/whƒÅnau provide an engaging and stimulating environment for children to lead their play. Children's perspectives are valued and respected. Children make their own play choices and have good access to resources.</p><p>Children are able to form friendships and are confident to explore together in an environment that promotes whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and a sense of belonging. Infants are especially well catered for in the centre where the environment invites them to explore and discover freely. Children are aware that adults are there to support them in their play in the indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Children enjoy engaging conversations with adults that prompt them to think and respond. WhƒÅnau actively provide a secure environment for children to form trusting relationships with a wider group of adults that help them to feel valued. Adults model desirable practices and strategies that nurture children‚Äôs social competence and behaviour.</p><p>Centre members' bicultural commitment is highly evident. Parents with confidence in te reo me ≈çna tikanga help to inspire newer members to understand biculturalism in Playcentre. Including measurable goals for bicultural practice in the centre's strategic plan could help keep a focus on improving responsiveness to MƒÅori children.</p><p>Good planning, assessment and evaluation processes are well documented. A reflection process at the end of each session provides an opportunity for parents to discuss children's learning and identify ways to extend learning experiences. Children's learning plans are visible and their individual portfolios record their participation in the programme. These portfolios could be strengthened by parents/whƒÅnau focusing more on assessment of the learning that is happening for each child over time.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau have implemented strategies to promote the centre in the surrounding communities and to sustain roll numbers. They have developed teams to share responsibility for key centre roles so that the knowledge and expertise are passed on. More experienced centre members support newer members in various aspects of their parenting, educator and management roles. Effective communication systems help members to share relevant information to the wider whƒÅnau and community.</p><p>Effective long-term strategic planning guides centre direction. Goals are referred to often and guide annual priorities. The Association's policy framework is well used and informs the centre's daily operations and management systems.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used well to support ongoing improvement. Centre members demonstrate a growing capacity to critically evaluate the effectiveness of all aspects of centre operations. Multiple voices are gathered and evaluation outcomes are well documented.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge the need to update some Association policies to incorporate the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act and recent changes in Health and Safety legislation. The Association is committed to promoting <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em> in all centres in coming months and continues to provide strong support for meaningful bicultural practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategically monitor their bicultural practices and the integration of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase their understanding of assessment and planning for children's learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Innes Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glen Innes Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>16 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
