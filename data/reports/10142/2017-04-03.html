</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Smiths City Childcare Centre in central Whangarei is a large centre licensed for 124 children including 25 children under two years of age. The centre is privately owned and has operated for 18 years. Many of the staff are long serving and most staff are qualified or in training. Leaders have responded positively to the last ERO review findings.</p><p>The centre is purpose built and caters for children in four age groups. Infants and toddlers are in the Bumbles area. Busy Bees caters for children between two and three years of age. These two areas operate in one building and staff share their knowledge of the children and their families.</p><p>The Beehive caters for children from three to four and half years of age. Bees Knees provides for children from four and a half years to school age. These two areas share an outdoor playground and occupy a second building.</p><p>The centre philosophy remains focused on promoting children's wellbeing and care. Each area also has its own teaching philosophy which teachers are beginning to review. Centre owners are committed to promoting a strong sense of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and settle quickly. Warm, caring relationships are evident between children and their teachers. Children make friends and include each other in their play. They develop positive social and emotional skills.</p><p>Teachers are friendly and approachable. They demonstrate teamwork to effectively support children's wellbeing and engagement in activities. Teachers spend time talking with families and build positive relationships with whānau.</p><p>The indoor learning environment is attractive for children to explore. The centre is well resourced. Children sustain their learning and use the resources well to extend their own learning, when time for free play is scheduled. Children's thinking and oral language are well supported by some teachers who use open-ended questions skilfully.</p><p>Māori children are valued as tangata whenua. They benefit from staff who identify as Māori and who speak te reo Māori with them. Whānau appreciate the willingness of staff to learn and incorporate te reo me ōna tikanga in the daily programme.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in supporting teachers to develop their bicultural understanding. Using internal expertise, the centre is promoting a more culturally inclusive programme and demonstrating a stronger commitment to <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em>. Teachers could consider using the Ministry of Education (MoE) resource <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em> to help evaluate Māori children's learning and development.</p><p>Children from other cultural backgrounds, including Pacific, value the centre's focus on celebrating diversity. The cultural recognition and celebrations the centre holds provides meaningful opportunities for families to contribute to and engage in the learning programme.</p><p>Children up to two years of age experience considerate, individualised care routines. New children are settled quickly. Staff collaborate well to ensure families are informed about their child's day. Teachers could enhance outcomes for infants and toddlers by developing their shared understanding of effective teaching practices using ERO and other resources.</p><p>Children between the ages of two and three years are well catered for by teachers who are respectful of and responsive to their interests. Teachers effectively promote younger children's independence and communication skills.</p><p>Parents of children with special learning requirements appreciate the ongoing support from staff who advocate for support on their behalf with external agencies. The inclusive, family friendly environment helps support children with a range of specialised learning needs</p><p>Programme planning is responsive to individual children's interests and their learning preferences. Teachers plan a wide range of interesting and engaging activities for children with literacy a significant curriculum focus. Mathematics and science could be further promoted in the programme to extend children's learning.</p><p>Good systems are in place to ensure the documentation individual children's assessment records. Portfolios are attractive and provide whānau with regular, valuable information about children's learning. Communication systems to increase learning partnerships between the centre and the home have been recently introduced.</p><p>Teacher leadership is a key area for the owners to continue to develop and support. A new shared leadership structure, trialled in one area, is building leadership capability and sustainability. Professional development has helped teachers strengthen self-review and build a good foundation for increasing internal evaluation in the centre. Performance management systems are under review and the centre owner has identified there is further work to do to strengthen appraisal processes.</p><p>The centre owner is also updating policies and procedures to align with the Vulnerable Children's Act and changes to Health and Safety legislation. This may be an opportune time for leaders to rationalise the current policy framework, checking that all policies and procedures clearly align with the changes to legislation and the Ministry of Education licensing criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that next steps for leaders and teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>broadening the strategic plan goals to focus on promoting positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using a wider range of educational resources, and indicators of effective teaching practice, to improve teachers' self-evaluation of their practice on children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring teachers' appraisal goals are linked to promoting outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>documenting centre processes and strengthening staff performance management.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that teachers review the transition to school programme to ensure the programme better reflects current educational research.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Smiths City Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, the centre owner should minimise tripping hazards. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Smiths City Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 April 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
