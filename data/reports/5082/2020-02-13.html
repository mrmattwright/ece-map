</table><p>Northcote Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Northcote Kindergarten on Auckland's North Shore is a well-established service that provides a sessional programme for up to 40 children over the age of two years.</p><p>A new head teacher has been appointed since the 2016 ERO review. She leads a teaching team of four qualified teachers, an unqualified teaching assistant and an administrator. The recently reviewed philosophy statement is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers aim to provide a safe, inclusive, enriched learning environment for all children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted positive relationships and interactions between children and adults, and active support for children to participate in all aspects of the learning programme. These remain as features of the programme. The report recommended strengthening internal evaluation, bicultural practices, annual planning and monitoring of strategic goals. There has been positive progress in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development for staff. A new AKA structure and new leadership roles have been established, and new personnel appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed. They display a strong sense of purpose and belonging in their kindergarten. Children are well supported to lead their learning in an attractive, well-maintained environment. All children have easy access to a wide range of quality resources. Teachers implement learning strategies aligned to children's interests.</p><p>Children play and learn in a respectful, unhurried setting. They confidently choose from a variety of learning activities that support and challenge them. The environment promotes exploration, curiosity, and imaginative and physical play. Teachers and parents acknowledge children as being capable learners and celebrate each child's learning journey with them.</p><p>Teachers notice and recognise when children are moving towards achieving their goals. Their use of teaching practices and preparation of learning tasks promotes children's' thinking and skill development. Children experience and develop important early language, literacy and numeracy abilities through the comprehensive curriculum. Teachers' reflective practices support curriculum design and enable them to identify children's dispositions and bring increasing levels of complexity to children's learning.</p><p>Families have responded well to the newly established Parent WhƒÅnau Group (PWG). A committee holds regular open meetings, events and working bees which are well attended by the community. Leaders and teachers continue to strengthen their partnerships with neighbouring schools. A comprehensive transition to school programme is well supported by parents, kindergarten staff and the schools.</p><p>Teachers work cooperatively to lead the kindergarten. Their collaborative review of the kindergarten philosophy and comprehensive professional learning programme has strengthened their commitment to bicultural practices.</p><p>Internal evaluation is clearly linked to the AKA strategic plan and the kindergarten's annual plan. It is well used by leaders and teachers to inform and enhance their practice. The regular review of policies and procedures ensures effective day-to-day management.</p><p>The AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. In many instances this has made a significant difference to teachers' confidence and capability. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers‚Äô inclusion of children with additional learning needs. Priority is being given to re-establishing and supporting Parent WhƒÅnau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction being established by new AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens‚Äô annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include teachers identifying and building on children's dispositions for learning to help support their developing working theories about the world around them.</p><p>It would be useful for AKA managers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify new roles and engage teaching teams in the implementation of the new structure across the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some kindergartens, across the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Northcote Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
