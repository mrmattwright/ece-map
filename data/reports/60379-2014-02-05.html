</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childspace Early Learning Ctr - Karori, is one of four Childspace early learning centres. This centre caters for 22 children up to the age of two, with most transitioning to Childspace Wilton around the time of their second birthday. A strong relationship exists between the Karori and Wilton centres.</p><p>The centre is designed to support the developmental stages of infants and toddlers using two different spaces, the nursery space for up to eight infants and the toddler space. Children transition flexibly between these rooms. There are seven teachers employed, including a centre manager and assistant manager, and a cook to provide nutritious meals for children. Four new teachers have been appointed since the August 2010 ERO report.</p><p>The areas for review and development identified in the previous review to do with strengthening self-review processes and monitoring outcomes have improved.</p><p>This service is governed by the Childspace Institute (the Institute). This organisation offers the wider early childhood sector professional development, resources and equipment. The centre is serviced by the Childspace Workshop. It has a high commitment to maintaining 80% to 100% of qualified teachers and ongoing teacher education and professional development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in of Childspace Early Learning Centres under the Childspace Institute.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The shared vision, to create a peaceful and respectful environment where all feel valued and loved, is highly evident in practice. There is a strong commitment to the centre philosophy which is focused on building respectful and reciprocal relationships. The curriculum has a strong emphasis on:</p><ul>
<li>providing safe and challenging experiences</li>
<li>the use of resources that encourage discovery, thinking and exploration</li>
<li>supporting free play and choice</li>
<li>relationships with children and their family</li>
<li>care routines as meaningful learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>The learning environment is designed to encourage infants and toddlers to engage, explore and develop their physical skills. The outdoor environment reflects the centre's commitment to nature education and sustainable practices and is an ongoing focus for the team. The infant environment, equipment and resources, caters well for the developmental needs of children. Infants are given time and space to move freely and build confidence.</p><p>Teachers develop trusting relationships with families when they start at the centre. Transition to the centre is a carefully implemented process. The centre uses a key teacher approach to promote secure attachments and relationships with children, parents and families. They communicate effectively with each other and share information about children, through diaries and regular formal and informal conversations. Teachers view each family and their knowledge of their child as an integral part of the learning community. They respond sensitively to each child's needs and preferences.</p><p>The planning framework has been strengthened as a result of an institute-wide review. Teachers effectively document learning experiences for children. These reflect their relationships with others, transitions and possible next learning steps through 'Journeys of Discovery'. Teachers use their knowledge of children and whƒÅnau to identify and plan for children's needs, interests and strengths. Parents have regular opportunities to respond to children‚Äôs assessments and they contribute to these by adding comments and stories through an online assessment tool.</p><p>A strategic priority identified by teachers is to incorporate te ao MƒÅori dimensions more naturally and authentically within the programme. Establishing a common team understanding of success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori should be explored. The teaching team has identified a need to broaden their knowledge and understanding of Pacific culture and practices.</p><p>A culture of inclusiveness is apparent. Teachers work closely with families and external agencies to ensure children with specific learning needs are fully involved in centre activities. Teachers are attuned to children's non verbal cues and gestures and can communicate using sign language.</p><p>Centre self-review processes are well developed and focused on quality improvement. Reviews provide opportunities for teachers to reflect on what they are doing. As a result, what is offered to children and families is improved and extended. Teachers are now ready to shift the focus of reviews from what they are doing to how well they are doing it. This shift should strengthen their reviews and better align with the intent of the Institute's process.</p><p>The principal, based at the Institute, is involved with the aspirations, learning programmes and developments within the centre and provides ongoing support to the teaching team. Leadership is a strength and well promoted. The appraisal system provides a clear process for staff. This is currently under review. There is a good quality of feedback from appraisers to promote growth in professional practices.</p><p>The Institute provides a high level of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust policies and procedures developed in consultation with teachers and parents</li>
<li>well-considered assessment and planning frameworks</li>
<li>clear processes and expectations for continuous review</li>
<li>professional learning and leadership opportunities for staff.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management plans clearly link to the Institute‚Äôs strategic plan. There is a focus on improvement through reflection, review and professional development. Many opportunities for teachers to further their education are provided.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and the principal have outlined in an action plan the priority areas for further development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop shared understandings with MƒÅori whƒÅnau for success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori, so teachers can measure the effectiveness of their practice</li>
<li>broaden the team‚Äôs knowledge and understanding of Pacific culture and practices</li>
<li>continue to strengthen self-review practice.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation affirms these priorities to further enhance teaching practice and outcomes for children and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childspace Early Learning Ctr-Karori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childspace Early Learning Ctr-Karori will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
