</table><p>Kaiti Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaiti Playcentre is located in Gisborne. The centre provides three sessions weekly for 30 children, including 15 up to the age of two. At the time of this review, there were 20 children enrolled, eight of whom identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre is administered by Playcentre Aotearoa, Central North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager. National policies are in the process of being developed and distributed to playcentres for implementation.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, 'whānau tupu ngātahi - families growing together' is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this the centre philosophy highlights the importance of promoting the uniqueness of each individual child as independent learners.</p><p>Whānau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children and share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre-elected office holders. A newly employed centre support worker is beginning to regularly visit centres to provide professional guidance and support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The February 2016 report identified key next steps for ongoing development at Kaiti Playcentre. These included assessment, planning and evaluation, te reo Māori integrated through the curriculum and building understanding and use of evaluation. Positive progress is evident in te reo Māori and aspects of assessment and planning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the Tairāwhiti area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children navigate the environment enthusiastically and independently. Learning experiences are grounded in Playcentre philosophy and values of manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Infants and toddlers confidently explore a range appropriate range of resources. Parents are responsive to the natural rhythms of these youngest learners.</p><p>Positive respectful relationships amongst children and adults build children's sense of well-being and belonging. Children confidently lead their learning.</p><p>Centre members are creating a responsive te ao Māori environment supported through te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Waiata, karakia, use of artefacts and celebration of events are shared and experienced by tamariki. Guidance and modelling from whānau Māori is helping to progress centre practices. Centre members recognise knowledge of te ao Māori remains an area of ongoing development.</p><p>Planning for learning is based on children's interests and parent aspirations. A collaborative approach to termly planning ensures an appropriate range of learning experiences is responsive to meet the needs of individual children. New parents are in the initial stages of working with the goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A next step is to build knowledge and understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> to inform planning, assessment and evaluation of children's learning over time in children's individual learning plans and portfolios.</p><p>Pacific children are supported within the inclusive environment through welcoming processes, Pasifika music, languages and community activities.</p><p>Transition in to the centre to upskill new members into the Playcentre way of being is supported by experienced members and leaders.</p><p>Playcentre’s national restructuring process has significantly hindered the support and professional development provided to centre members. Regional personnel are in the early stages of rebuilding collaboration and support networks. National systems and processes are yet to be consistently implemented. There is a recent focus on building relational trust and a responsive parent education system to establish more effective operations. A key next step is for regional managers to ensure that expected levels of support occur for each centre.</p><p>The appraisal process is currently based on annual review of successes and challenges. This requires further strengthening to better reflect roles and responsibilities, building of capability and evaluation of performance aligned to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>to build a working knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em> to guide curriculum decisions, priorities and planning</li>
<li>
<p>members understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level (Playcentre Aotearoa) priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to implement and promote national policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure ongoing support and education is provided to centre members to grow understanding of quality early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal process for employed staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the regional team actively monitors and evaluates the quality of support provided to playcentres to promote improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice Playcentre Aotearoa must ensure a regular cycle of policy review is undertaken. The organisation has stated that the implementation of national policies will take place at the beginning of August 2019.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>21 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
