</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kinderen (B) Daycare Centre is situated in central New Plymouth. It is one of two privately-owned early childhood services operated by the same management and governance team. The centre provides education and care for up to 28 children aged over two, five days a week.</p><p>Reorganisation of leadership in 2014 resulted in the internal appointment of a new centre manager. The current curriculum leader was appointed at the beginning of 2014.</p><p>The centre philosophy has recently been revised to ensure a common understanding of practice expectations among teachers. Leaders are currently working to better identify strengths of teachers and to better articulate the curriculum offered.</p><p>The July 2014 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included developing how te ao MƒÅori is recognised throughout the curriculum and strengthening of self-review practices. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are encouraged to be independent and respectful. They are valued, treated as competent learners and supported to build on their emerging ideas in order to extend their learning.</p><p>A useful and cohesive planning process is in place. Teachers plan to meet the needs of individuals and groups of children, using a project-based approach. Planning is shared with parents within the centre.</p><p>The curriculum focuses on developing children's resilience and interest in science by providing opportunities for exploration of the local area. The Forest Schools programme involves children in trips within the community and regular excursions to a local farm and forest. Science and numeracy are effectively integrated throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Interactions and relationships are positive and supportive of children and their families. Teachers are working to strengthen these relationships in order to further develop children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Learning stories of children's engagement in the programme provide a rich record of their time at the centre. A recently introduced online resource promotes and enables parents to provide regular feedback and to more fully engage in their children‚Äôs learning. Children's experiences are also shared daily in group learning stories within the centre. A key next step is to better capture the depth of children‚Äôs learning and to more consistently show their progress over time.</p><p>Teachers recognise the importance of acknowledging children's language, culture and identity. They seek to support children who speak te reo MƒÅori at home and to share this within the centre. Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are integrated throughout the curriculum. Teachers continue to engage in professional learning and development to build their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and competence in te reo MƒÅori. This should enable them to further embed bicultural practices.</p><p>There is an established process for appraisal. This has been strengthened to link teachers' goals to the Practising Teacher Criteria and centre priorities. The approach should be further improved through:</p><ul>
<li>the inclusion of formal observations of teachers' practice</li>
<li>professional feedback which considers the impact of teaching on outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><p>Professional learning and development is well supported. Staff needs are linked to centre priorities and focused on developing consistent teacher practices.</p><p>Strategic planning documentation supports consistency of procedures and ongoing development. Leaders are developing a more collaborative decision-making process to bring about centre wide improvements. These processes should be further enhanced with a clearer focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and aspects of good quality self-review are evident in the centre. Internal evaluation should be improved through clearer definition of the purpose and process of the evaluation. Teachers should develop ways to better use robust evidence to determine the quality and effectiveness of practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment and recording of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>bicultural practice and the promotion of educational success for MƒÅori children</li>
<li>understanding and implementation of internal evaluation</li>
<li>teacher appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderen (B) Daycare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinderen (B) Daycare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
