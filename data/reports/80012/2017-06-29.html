</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Arthur Burns Pre-school is a community-based early childhood service for children aged 2 to 5 years. Children attend for a mixture of full-day and half-day sessions depending on age and parent choice. The pre-school is located adjacent to Silverstream Primary School and has strong links to the school. The pre-school is governed by a parent-run management committee. A head teacher and another assistant head teacher manage and teach in the pre-school alongside a part time teacher. All of the teachers in the centre are fully qualified. Children and families attend the pre-school from a wide geographical area, including rural and urban settings.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review the pre-school has made progress in addressing its key next steps. This has included making the links between identified priorities for learning and the planned programmes more visible. The philosophy guides practice and expresses what the parent management committee and teachers value as important for children‚Äôs learning. The next step is to gather parent and whƒÅnau input from the wider parent community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The head teacher and teachers promote positive outcomes for children by providing a nurturing, respectful, inclusive and welcoming environment focused on progressing learning. Partnerships are based on genuine attitudes of respect, acceptance and responsiveness. The pre-school‚Äôs curriculum effectively supports MƒÅori children to achieve success as MƒÅori. Professional learning and development has been used to improve opportunities for children to learn about te ao MƒÅori. Children have opportunities to hear and use te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia. Teachers have a useful plan in place to further develop the bicultural curriculum and strengthen bicultural practices. An environment is developing where MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau know that their culture is valued. The centre is increasingly valuing the language and identity of other cultures.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to children‚Äôs diverse needs and dispositions. Teachers follow and extend children‚Äôs interests.</p><p>Thoughtful resourcing and organisation provide opportunities for children to revisit learning and sustain play in a range of areas both inside and outdoors. Teachers are mindful of setting up the environment and resources in a way that engages children in creative and authentic learning opportunities. Teachers take time to genuinely listen to children and build children‚Äôs understanding of the world around them. Teaching is supporting children to be independent within the centre routines. Intentional teaching includes co-construction of the learning opportunities. Teachers use some high quality teaching and assessment practices, and respond well to parent aspirations for their children's learning.</p><p>Assessments build children‚Äôs identity as successful learners. Some high quality assessment practices in some children‚Äôs learning stories reflect their continuity in learning and evaluate children‚Äôs progress in a range of contexts.</p><p>The management committee has successfully completed, and responded well to an internal evaluation around the effectiveness of what it does. Managers have identified that clearer guidelines on the function of the committee in managing the pre-school will strengthen systems and build sustainability.</p><p>To further strengthen strategic planning, the management committee have acknowledged, and ERO agrees, it needs to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure a robust appraisal system is in place</li>
<li>consult with the wider parent community within strategic priorities, and include relevant indicators of good practice in action planning</li>
<li>strengthen the reporting system between the head teacher and the management committee.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the head teacher are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and implement planning, assessment and evaluation systems for groups and individual children</li>
<li>consistently show in group planning and records of learning how children's language, culture and identity is responded to</li>
<li>over time evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and practices through internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Arthur Burns Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>GMA7 Suitable human resources management practices to be implemented, include:</p><ul>
<li>a system of regular appraisal</li>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
