</table><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 43 children, aged two years and over. Of the 54 children who attend, 11 identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy includes reference to four guiding principles that nurture the mana of children: whakaute, tino rangatiratanga, ako and manaakitanga. It also states the core values for working with Pacific cultures and emphasises the importance of weaving children‚Äôs cultures into the learning programme.</p><p>The head teacher leads a staff of five fully qualified teachers. The kindergarten is supported by a committee of parents who help to provide extra funding and resources. It continues to hold a Gold Healthy Heart Award.</p><p>ERO's May 2016 report identified the need for a more formal critique of teaching practices, strengthening responsiveness to MƒÅori children, and internal evaluation as areas requiring further development. Teachers have worked closely with their senior teacher to increase shared understandings of the purpose, and the association's process for internal evaluation. Internal evaluation continues to be an area for further work.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed and managed by He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association. A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens that include three Pacific kindergartens and a Pacific home-based service with two networks.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and implement a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of two kindergarten reviews in the He WhƒÅnau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and eager to learn. They work cooperatively as they explore interesting play areas in the spacious, very well resourced, natural environment. Outdoor play spaces provide challenges for children and promote their physical development. Children enjoy gardening as part of learning about sustainable practices.</p><p>Children experience respectful interactions with each other and their teachers. They confidently make choices about following their interests and participation in the learning programme. Children are effectively supported to develop social competence, self-help and independence skills. Their oral language skills are fostered through a range of approaches including questions that prompt further development of ideas.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. Together they provide a learning programme that is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and abilities. Children with diverse learning needs are well supported in their wellbeing and learning. Teachers liaise effectively with families, external agencies, and association support networks.</p><p>Children are viewed as confident, capable learners. Teachers maintain an intentional focus on children‚Äôs learning and development. They foster children‚Äôs thinking and creativity by extending their ideas through discussions and the wide range of readily available art resources.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for children, parents and whƒÅnau. They nurture the cultural identity of tamariki MƒÅori. Teachers value and respect the home languages of children who speak languages other than English. They provide useful, relevant support to families to help build each child‚Äôs sense of belonging in the kindergarten and their wellbeing.</p><p>Children‚Äôs interests and participation in the learning programme is regularly documented. Teachers write detailed records of children‚Äôs possible learning from their involvement in activities and experiences. Some children have individual learning plans. Teachers should further extend their assessment of children‚Äôs learning by more clearly showing how they will plan for each child‚Äôs next learning steps.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs involvement and learning through attractively presented assessment portfolios, extensive wall displays and digital technology. Teachers seek and value parents‚Äô views. They encourage parents to spend time at the kindergarten and contribute their skills and knowledge to the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and access a good range of professional learning and research to continually grow their understandings. ERO and staff agree that streamlining and alignment of processes and documentation would support a more strategic focus on keys areas for development. Narrowing the focus of internal evaluation, and emphasising outcomes for children as indicators for success, is a next step.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers are expected to inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The senior teaching team are reflective, and improvement focused. They successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Well-developed systems and processes guide teacher‚Äôs in their work and positively impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whƒÅnau and community. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that key next steps for improving outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>purposefully aligning processes and documentation to support a more strategic focus on key areas for development and evaluation</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen assessment, planning, and evaluation processes and practices by explicitly linking learning outcomes and parent aspirations into learning stories and deliberately evaluating the effectiveness of learning and teaching</li>
<li>continuing to use internal evaluation to deepen shared understandings of the evaluation process and its purpose for improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to follow the strategic direction set through T≈´manako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi based Strategic Priority Framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paraparaumu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>28 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
