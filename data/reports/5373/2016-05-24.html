</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten is located in Paraparaumu on the Kapiti Coast. Since the August 2012 ERO report, hours of operation have changed and a full-day service now operates for children from two years to school age. There are currently five teachers including the head teacher, all of whom are qualified and registered.</p><p>The service caters for up to 40 children. Of those enrolled, 12 are Māori children.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy highlights three guiding principles which are anchored in te ao Māori concepts. These kupu Māori include whakaute, to show care and respect, tino rangatiratanga, to exercise self-determination and ako, to learn from each other. These values and beliefs are highly evident in practice and in children's interactions with each other, adults and the environment. Parents and whānau are actively engaged in a learning partnership. </p><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association).This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. In September 2015, the association began introducing an initiative called 'Keeping Kindergarten Strong' to support the management of financial constraints. Currently a project is in place to support managing of teacher workload. </p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated responsibility for kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children's learning.</p><p>The August 2012 ERO report for Paraparaumu Kindergarten identified that support for leadership including a review of the appraisal process required further development. These areas have improved and progressed.</p><p>Areas for the association to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified and positive progress has occurred. Some areas continue to need further refining and are next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association's strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a learning environment that effectively supports them as confident, capable and socially competent learners. Whakaute is enacted through respect for each other, adults, animals and the environment.</p><p>An established and well-resourced outdoor environment physically encourages and challenges children. They are risk-takers, experience learning as fun and demonstrate ako, to be a teacher and a learner in sharing ideas.</p><p>Children are encouraged and supported to lead their learning. They set challenges for themselves, persevere to succeed and collaborate to achieve a common goal through negotiated discussion. Children can make decisions about who they engage with and in what.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is guided by children's interests, strengths and some parent input. A range of opportunities for families to contribute to their children's learning is in place. Teachers seek families' aspirations and respond to them over time. Teachers and children know each other well. </p><p>Te ao Māori is an underpinning ethos in the kindergarten and is woven through the curriculum. Literacy, mathematics and wellbeing are emphasised. The kindergarten has achieved a gold award in the Healthy Heart programme. A clear focus on improving children's physical activity is documented in kindergarten planning.</p><p>Māori children's language, culture and identity are validated and affirmed. Local history, landmarks, legends and stories form a focus. Mana whenua input is building knowledge and understanding of children, parents, whānau and teachers.</p><p>Staff identify they need to further strengthen how they work with Pacific children and their families. This is an ongoing area for develop. A next step is for the curriculum to reflect this and the ethnicities of all children who attend the kindergarten.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported. Teachers work in partnership with families and outside agencies to support their individual learning needs. ERO's evaluation affirms staff direction to continue to extend knowledge and support each child's full participation.</p><p>Profile books provide a meaningful record of children's participation in the programme. Learning stories include attributes, progress over time, some parent and children's voice and assessment information that is appropriately used to inform future planning. Teachers regularly audit to identify gaps and areas for development. The planning wall is highly visible for parents and children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Transition into the kindergarten and on to school is well considered. Staff actively seek feedback from schools and this, along with other well-developed processes, helps to build strong relationships for children and families.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective. Self review is an embedded practice that has led to improved outcomes for children. ERO's evaluation affirms leaders' intention for staff to continue to develop knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback in relation to centre priorities and the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next step for Paraparaumu Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>to continue to develop and use shared understandings of internal evaluation to enhance teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening of responsiveness to Māori children.<b> </b></p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paraparaumu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paraparaumu Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>24 May 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
