</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>EEW Homebased Education provides home-based education and care for children from birth to school age in Hamilton and surrounding areas. Children are placed in family homes with one educator, who can be responsible for up to four children at any one time. The network is licensed to cater for 60 children. Its current roll of 56 includes 14 children of MƒÅori descent. It offers flexible hours to meet individual family needs.</p><p>EEW East is operated by Early Education Waikato (EEW). EEW is limited liability company with charitable provisions that is owned by Waikato Kindergarten Association. It provides governance and strategic direction for a number of early childcare centres, as well as the homebased care networks. Prior to May 2015, EEW's homebased care networks were owned by Hamilton Childcare Services Trust. EEW East is a Quality Funded network. This is the first ERO report for this network under the governance of EEW.</p><p>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) manages EEW with the support of experienced leadership and administration teams. As licensee, she is responsible for the overall quality of education and care, self review, marketing, compliance, and property, financial and human resource management.</p><p>An Education Services Manager (ESM) has delegated responsibility for managing the network with the support of an EEW lead visiting teacher, and a visiting teacher responsible for this network. The ESM, lead-visiting teacher and visiting teacher are fully qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The visiting teacher's role is to guide and support educators to:</p><ul>
<li>provide an appropriate standard of education and care</li>
<li>evaluate and plan individual children‚Äôs learning and share this with their families</li>
<li>meet health and safety requirements.</li>
</ul><p>She regularly visits children in their educators' homes and sees children at frequent playgroup sessions. As EEW East is a quality funded network, all of its educators have completed some formal early childhood training. The service encourages educators to attend workshops and undertake training to support them in their role.</p><p>EEW's vision is 'every child reaching their full potential', with the aim of creating a sustainable organisation that provides quality education and care to enrich the lives of children and families. Leaders have identified the need to develop a specific philosophy for EEW's homebased education and care service.</p><p>The programme includes regular playgroups with children and educators in other EEW homebased services. In addition, children experience visits within the local community to parks and libraries, musical experiences and a planned programme of movement and gymnastics.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a wide variety of learning experiences in educators' homes. They also have many well-planned opportunities to work with and alongside children of diverse ages and abilities, and to form trusting relationships with adults in family-like environments.</p><p>Records about children's learning in educators' homes indicate that they are settled, work well with other children and solve problems together. Assessments reflect children's love of music, dancing, and imaginative play. Visiting teachers frequently contribute learning stories about outings and playgroup experiences which parents can access electronically at home. There are good examples of educators effectively supporting MƒÅori and other children's language, culture and identity.</p><p>Children and educators benefit from the visiting teacher's high level professional knowledge and experience in homebased education and care. The visiting teacher, in collaboration with her colleagues, highly values and promotes learning through play, exploration and everyday experiences in home settings. The visiting teacher knows children very well. She takes the time to get to know families, ascertain their aspirations for their children and access specialist support as required.</p><p>Visiting teachers have established strong partnerships with families based on acceptance, genuine respect, and a willingness to listen and respond. Some families regularly contribute to their children's digital learning portfolios. Other families would appreciate more opportunities to discuss and contribute to planning for their children's learning.</p><p>EEW playgroup and gymnastics sessions, and excursions, provide high quality opportunities for educators and teachers to network, and for children to interact with a wider group of children, and other educators.</p><p>Visiting teachers use these programmes and regular visits to educators' homes to model effective teaching practices, with a strong focus on supporting children's emotional wellbeing. At playgroup, educators share their knowledge and ideas and work collaboratively to support the learning of all children. Gymnastics sessions include valuable cultural and music experiences.</p><p>Visiting teachers have established highly responsive and trusting relationships with educators. These relationships underpin the support and guidance provided for educators, which enables them to collectively contribute to high quality outcomes for children. Effective support for educators enables them to:</p><ul>
<li>settle children, manage relationships between children and foster development of social and language skills</li>
<li>identify and respond to individual children's learning and interests, and to document this in their online portfolios and journals.</li>
<li>use the service's high quality resource library to support children to further explore emerging learning and interests</li>
<li>take a leadership role in sharing aspects of their language and culture with children and other educators.</li>
</ul><p>EEW, as a governing body, is strongly focused on improving the quality of outcomes for children through the quality of self review. The organisation ensures that appropriate professional development opportunities are available for visiting teachers and educators. The CEO, ESM and visiting teachers are highly committed to the organisation's vision of ensuring that 'every child reaching their full potential'.</p><p>The CEO has developed an interim strategic plan focused on sustainability and long term viability of the service. The ESM and the visiting teachers have collaboratively developed an annual plan that covers many aspects of the service's operation. They could further strengthen annual plans by more clearly identifying outcomes for children, and linking these to self review and teacher appraisal findings.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and EEW leaders agree that useful next steps for this network are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen performance appraisal processes for visiting teachers</li>
<li>more systematically build educators' skills and knowledge by providing clearly documented feedback and next steps about improving educational outcomes for children</li>
<li>more clearly document children's learning and interests, educators' responses and children's progress over time</li>
<li>clearly define the roles and responsibilities of visiting teachers, including professional leadership, self review and reporting.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of EEW Homebased Education - East completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of EEW Homebased Education - East will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>2 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework NgƒÅ Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
