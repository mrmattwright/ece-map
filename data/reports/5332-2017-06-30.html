</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.¬†</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Naenae Kindergarten is located in Lower Hutt. The centre is licensed for up to 41 children aged over two years. Six-hour days are offered three times a week with shorter sessions on the other two days. At the time of this ERO review, 13 of the children enrolled identified as MƒÅori and 10 as Pacific.</p><p>Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher. All teachers are fully qualified. Support staff are also employed. There have been some staff and leadership changes since ERO's 2015 review.</p><p>The June 2015 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included:</p><ul>
<li>building leadership capacity and a collaborative team</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy and developing clear indicators of high quality practice</li>
<li>consistently promoting children‚Äôs social competence and quality literacy practices</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>integrating the use of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and promoting success for MƒÅori and Pacific children</li>
<li>developing an understanding of self review and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>Good progress has been made in addressing these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the 2015 ERO report, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governing board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The association has been responsive to their next steps outlined by ERO in 2015. A strategic plan has been developed to guide operations and decision making. It includes strategies to promote cultural responsiveness for MƒÅori and Pacific families. Regular evaluative reports are made to the board. Senior teachers closely monitor the implementation of the teacher appraisal process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm and positive relationships. Teachers collaborate on a varied programme of play-based experiences, in response to group interests. They work closely with children. Oral language and literacy learning are woven into interactions. A range of useful strategies effectively support children‚Äôs social competence and growing independence.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers liaise regularly with whƒÅnau, and external agencies are accessed when required.</p><p>Children's learning is enhanced by strong family and community involvement. WhƒÅnau have regular opportunities to influence the programme, and their expertise is warmly welcomed. Excursions into the surrounding neighbourhood, including local schools, provide a meaningful localised curriculum.</p><p>Children, whƒÅnau and staff benefit from a positive team culture. Teachers share a commitment to the kindergarten's philosophy. A highly effective, collaborative leadership approach is evident.</p><p>Portfolios capture children‚Äôs interests and learning dispositions. Links are made to the kindergarten philosophy and the early childhood curriculum <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. A next step is to strengthen documentation, to demonstrate how a clear cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation informs deliberate teaching. Leaders have identified that learning stories should more explicitly respond to parent aspirations and children‚Äôs culture, language and identity. ERO agrees.</p><p>Meaningful information is shared with children and whƒÅnau to support their successful transition to school. Excursions to local schools give children regular opportunities to interact with their older peers, in kapa haka as well as other MƒÅori and Pacific events.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is valued and celebrated. Cultural celebrations and waiata MƒÅori are popular activities. Teachers are working to increase their use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday conversations with children.</p><p>The association has identified developing its understanding of what educational success looks like for whƒÅnau MƒÅori and Pacific communities as a strategic priority across all kindergartens. Leaders and teachers are strengthening their relationships with whƒÅnau of priority children towards meaningful learning partnerships. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>The teaching team members are developing their understanding of the process and use of internal evaluation. ERO and leaders agree that narrowing the focus of evaluations, using specific and measurable indicators, will enable them to regularly evaluate the impact of their practices.</p><p>Senior teachers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. They provide ongoing evaluative feedback and feed-forward to improve, strengthen and challenge teacher practice.</p><p>A comprehensive appraisal system is in place to grow and support teachers in the kindergarten. Teachers set useful goals to continually improve their practice. Formal observations of teacher practice are key next step to support this process.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that priority actions are:</p><ul>
<li>developing assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>enacting reciprocal learning partnerships with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and Pacific families</li>
<li>refining internal evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naenae Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Naenae Kindergarten will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>30 June 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 0px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
