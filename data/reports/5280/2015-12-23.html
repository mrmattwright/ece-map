</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mary Richmond Kindergarten is licensed to provide early childhood care and education for up to 43 children aged over two years. The service is located in the Napier suburb of Maraenui and has a role of 38 children, of whom 28 are MƒÅori. Morning sessions cater for younger children, those older may also attend in the afternoon. Since 2012, there has been a substantial increase in the number of younger children attending.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operation of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association and support for the general manager. Two education managers are responsible for building teacher capability. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Matauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. He demonstrates a clear vision for MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>There has been growth in parent, whƒÅnau and community input and presence. Culture, language and identity has been further celebrated through the input of Enviroschools programme.</p><p>Since the October 2012 ERO report, positive features have been sustained. Progress is evident in teachers‚Äô responses to the recommended next steps.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 9 reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships are a strength of the kindergarten. Children confidently participate in learning. Their cooperative play and choices are well supported. The centre philosophy highlights Kotahitanga. This principle of oneness is enacted through practices that promote belonging, respect and tuakana teina, and reflect parent and whƒÅnau aspirations for their children. Manaakitanga and high levels of care for children are evident.</p><p>The curriculum continues to develop with Enviroschools becoming more embedded. The recently introduced Mindfulness programme empowers children to communicate and self-manage. This programme contributes to increased whƒÅnau engagement in their children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is central to the environment. The development of the Whare Manu provides a focus for children and whƒÅnau to connect the MƒÅori natural world. Children embrace and value the space. Teachers have strengthened their te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori and actively continue their development in this area. MƒÅori ways of knowing, doing and being are enacted.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profile books are attractively presented and include individual and group narratives. Links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum are included. Children are portrayed as confident and competent learners through stories. There has been recent progress in strengthening the learning links in profiles. Teachers continue to improve how they record children‚Äôs learning over time.</p><p>The head teacher provides reflective professional leadership focused on improving outcomes for children. A distributed leadership model, which draws on team members‚Äô strengths and interests is evident. The experienced team accesses relevant and useful learning and development. Continuing to improve the appraisal process to support growth in teaching practices is a next step.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô approach to self review has improved and better informs kindergarten developments. It includes children‚Äôs and parents' input. An ongoing review of transitions to school should provide more seamless processes for children and their families. The planned curriculum review should provide a useful opportunity to deeply explore how effectively the needs and interests of all children are responded to.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team‚Äôs strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include self review, assessment, planning, internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further extend the scope and impact of self review, and develop some aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>improve appraisal goal setting, evidence, observations, feedback and next steps.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mary Richmond Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mary Richmond Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
