<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School in Pukekohe is one of three local centres under the same management providing education and care for children from babies through to school age. Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School and Little Pukeko Pre-School enrol children through to age four and the children may then move to Flying Turtles Pre-School next door. At the time of the previous ERO review in 2009, Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School had children enrolled through to school age.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report commented positively on the relationships at the centre, the effective partnership between parents and teachers, and the good child-initiated programme and learning environment. These features continue to be strengths of the centre.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy the many opportunities to play for extended periods of time. They make good use of the large well-planned and resourced outdoor area. The indoor area is also well equipped and provides many opportunities for learning. Teachers often help children to access resources to support their activities.</p><p align="left">Teachers encourage children to choose their play and to take risks in a safe and stimulating environment. They support children&rsquo;s development of oral language and early literacy and numeracy very well. Science and creativity are integral parts of the programme.</p><p align="left">Children form firm relationships and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p align="left">Teachers often follow the babies&rsquo; own sleeping and meal routines from home. While an enclosed area is provided for babies and toddlers, they are encouraged to use all of the centre&rsquo;s facilities and to play alongside the older children. This inclusive approach encourages tuakana/teina relationships, and the older children enjoy supporting the younger children.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report acknowledged the good work that teachers had done to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation and made suggestions that would support children&rsquo;s play. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p align="left">Centre managers have recognised that self review and strategic planning could be strengthened to support ongoing improvement in all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPrickly Hedgehog Pre-School.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy acknowledges the importance of children being challenged in a safe, caring and respectful environment. It identifies the value of teachers working in partnership with parents to provide a programme that is centred on children&rsquo;s strengths and interests.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Relationships and interactions</h4><p align="left">Teachers focus on ensuring that children have a strong sense of belonging at the centre. They treat children with respect and consideration. They take into account home routines of the younger children in relation to feeding and sleeping. Children are confident to approach adults, knowing that they will be supported.</p><h4 align="left">The programme</h4><p align="left">Children have many opportunities throughout the day to follow their own interests, make choices about their learning and persist in chosen activities. Teachers are available to support them with resources. They ask questions and make suggestions to encourage children to think about the direction of their play.</p><h4 align="left">Learning opportunities</h4><p align="left">There are many opportunities for children to develop oral language and to learn early literacy and numeracy skills. Teachers promote an interest in the natural world and encourage participation in art and music.</p><h4 align="left">Partnership with parents</h4><p align="left">There is a strong partnership between the centre and its families.&nbsp; Parents are well informed about centre activities by regular communication through newsletters, notices, emails, parent evenings and social events.&nbsp; Parents and wh&#257;nau contribute to the programme by adding stories about home in children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><h4 align="left">Learning environment</h4><p align="left">The centre managers have continued to make improvements to the learning environment. Teachers review areas of play to make decisions about the layout of the centre and resources. New developments in the outdoor area have enhanced the play opportunities and encourage physical activity and challenge. Resources and well maintained and age appropriate.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">Centre managers recognise that self review and annual planning could be strengthened, and appropriate professional development is planned. Programme evaluation and appraisal systems could be more rigorous to support ongoing improvement.</p><h4 align="left">Programme management</h4><p align="left">The centre managers and ERO agree that programme planning needs further development so that assessment is used better to inform the programme.</p><h4 align="left"><span>Aspects of teaching</span></h4><p align="left"><span>To build on their existing good quality practices, teachers could also</span> extend the use of te reo M&#257;ori in their interactions with children and find more opportunities to be with children and extend children&rsquo;s thinking through conversation.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-prickly-hedgehog-pre-school" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School.</p><p align="left">Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School in Pukekohe is one of three local centres under the same management providing education and care for children from babies through to school age. Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School and Little Pukeko Pre-School enrol children through to age four and the children may then move to Flying Turtles Pre-School next door. At the time of the previous ERO review in 2009, Prickly Hedgehog Pre-School had children enrolled through to school age.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report commented positively on the relationships at the centre, the effective partnership between parents and teachers, and the good child-initiated programme and learning environment. These features continue to be strengths of the centre.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy the many opportunities to play for extended periods of time. They make good use of the large well-planned and resourced outdoor area. The indoor area is also well equipped and provides many opportunities for learning. Teachers often help children to access resources to support their activities.</p><p align="left">Teachers encourage children to choose their play and to take risks in a safe and stimulating environment. They support children&rsquo;s development of oral language and early literacy and numeracy very well. Science and creativity are integral parts of the programme.</p><p align="left">Children form firm relationships and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p align="left">Teachers often follow the babies&rsquo; own sleeping and meal routines from home. While an enclosed area is provided for babies and toddlers, they are encouraged to use all of the centre&rsquo;s facilities and to play alongside the older children. This inclusive approach encourages tuakana/teina relationships, and the older children enjoy supporting the younger children.</p><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report acknowledged the good work that teachers had done to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation and made suggestions that would support children&rsquo;s play. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p align="left">Centre managers have recognised that self review and strategic planning could be strengthened to support ongoing improvement in all aspects of centre operations.</p></html>
