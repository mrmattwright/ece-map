<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the LIFE Childcare Centre 1 governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the December 2011 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the extent to which teaching practices and programme routines support children‚Äôs learning and development</li>
<li>the effectiveness of programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>the extent to which personnel policies, including appraisal, promote high quality teaching practices</li>
<li>the extent to which self review is resulting in improved centre operation</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that may arise during course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>LIFE Childcare Centre 1 is located in Mangere, Auckland. The centre provides full day education and care for children from six months to three and a half years of age. It shares a purpose-built building with LIFE Childcare Centre 2 which caters for older children. Each centre is divided into two rooms with shared outdoor spaces.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 review identified concerns relating to the teaching programme, personnel policies including appraisal, and self review. Centre leaders have made good progress in addressing these concerns and the service is now becoming well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre practices and programmes are underpinned by a philosophy of Christ-centred early childhood care and education. The centre‚Äôs vision and mission are visibly integrated in the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the LIFE Church. Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review, changes have been made to the structure of the organisation‚Äôs childcare division. A newly appointed centre manager is well supported to develop as a leader and to guide centre improvement.</p><p>Respectful staff relationships exist within a positive and supportive environment. There is a calm and settled atmosphere in the centre. Teachers are caring and closely involved with children in their play. Children are settled and interact positively with their peers. They enjoy the opportunity to select play areas and engage in individual or group play.</p><p>Relationships between teachers, children and families are valued and contribute to the centre‚Äôs inclusive atmosphere. A number of communication initiatives keep parents well informed about the service and the programme for children.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Good progress has been made in approving teaching practices and programme routines. Teachers use recent research and are receptive to new ideas that support children‚Äôs learning and development. Centre-wide programmes are responsive to children‚Äôs interests and allow more time for their sustained participation. The centre celebrates diversity and programmes are inclusive of MƒÅori, Pacific and other cultures.</p><p>Good structures are in place to support the continued improvement of programme planning, assessment and evaluation. The establishment of a curriculum manager role has helped teachers develop these areas. Assessment and evaluation practices now inform planning. A new programme planning model allows teachers to reflect and respond to children‚Äôs emerging and ongoing interests. Good guidelines and monitoring systems support teachers in the development of their practice.</p><p>Progress is evident in the development and implementation of personnel policies. Clear job descriptions clarify the roles of management and leadership. Teachers‚Äô appraisals have been refined, and good advice and guidance processes are in place for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>Self review informs centre development and promotes positive outcomes for children. Self review is linked to the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plan and clear goals are well monitored. Centre- wide review and reviews conducted by teachers in each room are guided by clear processes and high expectations for positive results. Centre leaders and teachers compile good review evidence.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agreed that managers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>encourage more children‚Äôs input into programme decisions</li>
<li>encourage more in-depth evaluation of teaching practice and its impact on positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>refine appraisal to promote teachers‚Äô reflective practices and link these to the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>include spontaneous reviews around planned self review.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>4 Recommendations</span></h2><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders continue to refine self review and centre operations to guide ongoing improvement.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 February 2013</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>
