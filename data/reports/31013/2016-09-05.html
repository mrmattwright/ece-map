</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Awamutu Playcentre is a parent cooperative early childhood service operating under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA) and is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation. The association provides the centre with effective governance, strategic direction, management support and adult education programmes.</p><p>The KCPA has a strategic commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi and places high value on productive partnerships with MƒÅori whƒÅnau. Funding is made available for related professional development and the association‚Äôs use of <em>Ka Hikitia</em> has resulted in clear expectations for members to build their understanding, confidence and competence in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on parents and children learning together through play in a natural, safe and supportive environment. The centre has a stable roll and is licensed to cater for 30 children including 15 up to two years of age. Most sessions are mixed-age and a session for children who are close to school age was established in response to the needs of older children.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review identified areas for development either have or are being addressed. The centre has made good progress and recent upgrades to the learning areas and some building developments have enhanced the learning and care environment for adults and children. The centre is located in Te Awamutu and is situated in spacious and well-maintained grounds.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentres in the King Country Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre warmly welcomes prospective parents, whƒÅnau and their children. New members are encouraged to be part of the playcentre family.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and young children and their parents and whƒÅnau demonstrate levels of enjoyment, belonging and wellbeing. The centre environment nurtures the growth and development of both children and parents. Children of all ages have many opportunities to make choices and explore their interests alongside one another, supportive parents and whanau. Children and babies enjoy responsive care from adults.</p><p>Babies and toddlers bring a very natural aspect to playcentre relationships. They have specific areas for play and sleep when needed. Parents offer babies and toddlers a range of appropriate experiences and respond to their temperaments, preferences and interests. Babies and toddlers are free to solve problems and develop their growing mastery of their physical development. They also play alongside each other and with their siblings as well as other older children. Breastfeeding mothers have quiet and comfortable spaces to feed their babies.</p><p>Young children have many opportunities to develop their social competencies and often include younger siblings and other children in their play. They are able to express their ideas, opinions and creativity through complex play and projects over time. The indoor and outdoor areas provide children with a wide range of opportunities to learn through play. Children‚Äôs oral language is fostered and they are engaged in meaningful contexts, which provide them with opportunities to develop their ideas about early literacy and mathematics.</p><p>Parents' knowledge and skills are recognised and their contributions valued. The programme is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and needs. Parents encourage their children to explore and investigate the environment. The ‚ÄòBig Kids‚Äô programme includes excursions to the wider local community. These opportunities contribute to children‚Äôs learning about the world around them.</p><p>A range of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori visual displays and focus areas encourage parents to use MƒÅori phrases in their interactions with children. MƒÅori tamariki and their whƒÅnau model culturally responsive practices and other parents benefit from learning in their presence.</p><p>There is a good understanding of self review for continuous improvement and development. Session analysis considers the programme in action and helps parents to plan ways to extend children‚Äôs learning and interests. A major review of portfolios and assessment practices, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs progress has identified what was working well and what needed to be improved. This process provides parents with a useful framework for the recording of children's learning and encourages them to reflect about ways they might contribute to the different ways their children learn.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members should consider the following areas for review and development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The level of member participation in the play centre course programme to increase parent's confidence and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sharing of effective teaching strategies that promote children‚Äôs development and learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration and use of te reo MƒÅori in learning conversations with children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of appropriate links to local schools so children can experience a seamless transition into school.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>It is important for experienced members with higher course qualifications to plan for and build the capability of new parents to sustain and improve playcentre practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Awamutu Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Awamutu Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>
