</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te K&#257;inga P&#333;tiki - Choices Early Childhood Centre is part of the Kahungunu Health Services Organisation, which provides a range of services such as health, midwifery and educational programmes to the Hastings community.</p><p>The centre acknowledges M&#257;ori as tangata whenua and is committed to Tiriti-based partnerships through an holistic approach to education and care. The roll of 33 currently includes 27 children who are M&#257;ori. To increase children&rsquo;s participation in early childhood, transport and lunches are provided.</p><p>Since the February 2013 ERO review, a new centre manager and teaching team are in place. The centre provides a dedicated classroom for children aged under 2 years.</p><p>The previous ERO review found a significant number of areas for development and review. This report highlights that considerable progress has been made towards providing a safe and positive learning environment for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know children well. They recognise children&rsquo;s place as part of a wider wh&#257;nau, iwi and community. The curriculum is suitably responsive to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children&rsquo;s needs and rhythms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents&rsquo; aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what educators notice about children&rsquo;s strengths and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is current and relevant to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children&rsquo;s culture.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The curriculum promotes positive learning outcomes for infants and toddlers, particularly in relation to the communication and exploration strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Teachers consistently engage in one&#8209;to-one, highly responsive interactions with infants and toddlers.</p><p>In the Under 2 room, consistent care giving by small numbers of teachers enables them to respond sensitively to each child&rsquo;s changing needs and preferences. Educators interpret and respond to subtle non-verbal clues offered by infants. The environment is calm and unhurried. There are comfortable spaces for babies who are not yet mobile.</p><p>Children are empowered to lead their own learning and take responsibility for themselves and others. Teachers use learning opportunities within routines to emphasise literacy and numeracy and to foster communication. Teachers show respect, acknowledging children&rsquo;s successes and talking to them about decisions that affect them.</p><p>Consistent routines give children a sense of security. The learning environment is well organised and purposefully resourced, with multi-purpose equipment that fosters exploration and imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers carefully consider children&rsquo;s transitions into the centre and how they will support them moving from the under 2 to the over 2 classroom. Information from parents and teachers&rsquo; observations are well used during these times. Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging is effectively fostered.</p><p>Assessment information, collated in children&rsquo;s portfolios is beginning to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how children&rsquo;s interests are responded to and their learning over time is reinforced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children&rsquo;s learning in relation to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how children&rsquo;s learning at home links to their learning at the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Educators are developing useful assessment records to guide their planning and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning. This is a self-identified area of review and development and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation affirms this as a useful next step.</p><p>Teachers are strengthening learning partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau. Increased opportunities exist for wh&#257;nau to contribute to their child&rsquo;s programme and to centre curriculum decisions. Staff value parents&rsquo; expertise and input and are building trusting relationships.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; practice incorporates the principles of <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</em> They value M&#257;ori identity as a foundation of success for children. The curriculum is responsive to M&#257;ori culture, with very frequent use of te reo M&#257;ori and deliberate and planned inclusion of te ao M&#257;ori in programme planning.</p><p>An inclusive approach acknowledges and promotes other languages and cultures, such as Samoan, within children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><p>The new manager has successfully focused on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building a collaborative team with a culture of trusting relationships and a high level of commitment to bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing others as leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing systems and processes to support consistency of high quality practices for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Useful and targeted professional development has supported improvements since the previous ERO review and resulted in increased individual and collective capability.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; understanding and implementation of self review is developing well. Self review is becoming well documented and systematic. As a result of review, planning incorporates appropriate areas of priority.</p><p>A clear vision seeks to realise the potential of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. The trust that governs the centre has strengthened systems to support service operations to meet this vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre strategic and annual plans identify appropriate next steps and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation affirms these as useful areas for ongoing development. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and establish a new centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen teachers&rsquo; capacity to provide consistently high quality education and care for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and embed assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen parent and wh&#257;nau engagement in partnerships for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te K&#257;inga P&#333;tiki - Choices Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have&nbsp;taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te K&#257;inga P&#333;tiki - Choices Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region&nbsp;</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.&nbsp;</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to </em><a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices">ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>. </em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services.">ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.&nbsp;</p></html>
