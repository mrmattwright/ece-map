</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre is a non-profit, parent co-operative education and care centre located in Alicetown, Lower Hutt. The service is licensed for 32, including eight children up to two years. Staff and learning spaces are divided into two age-related groups.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises community, empowerment, holistic learning and culturally responsive practice.</p><p>Since the March 2014 ERO report, the service has appointed an under two team leader, who oversees the programme in the infants and toddlers' section. Provision for infants and toddlers is underpinned by Pikler and Resources of Infant Education (RIE) teaching theory, which emphasise respectful practices and close attachments. Children transition through the centre near the time of their second birthday.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the outdoor areas have been redeveloped. The centre provides food for children, and has a Healthy Heart award. The teaching team members are long serving.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently participate in a rich curriculum of play-based learning experiences. They benefit from positive interactions with highly respectful, attentive teachers. Physical challenge and active movement is very well promoted. An emphasis is placed on natural resources and sustainability. Children develop their self-help skills and social competence through a range of effective teaching strategies.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are very well supported through consistent, responsive teaching. They freely explore learning spaces and access resources, according to their preferences. Teachers are highly sensitive to the communication and cues of very young learners, successfully establishing strong and secure attachments. Physical development and growing independence are monitored and celebrated. </p><p>Teachers purposefully build effective partnerships with parents and whānau. Well-considered strategies are used to share children’s learning and other useful information about the programme. This close communication supports children and families well during transitions into and through the centre.</p><p>Teachers closely observe children, and demonstrate strong knowledge of their special skills, knowledge, interests and family contexts. These observations are regularly discussed and used to plan and document experiences. A next step for the centre is to continue to strengthen assessment documentation. Portfolios should more clearly show how individualised teaching strategies have enhanced children's progress.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are very well supported. Teachers liaise with parents and outside agencies to effectively support, monitor and celebrate ongoing progress.</p><p>Valuable learning about the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand is highly evident in the programme. Te ao me te reo Māori are integral to the curriculum. Leaders actively support teachers' practice in this area. The culture, language and identity of tamariki and whānau Māori are celebrated in portfolios, through the use of kaupapa Māori assessment practices.</p><p>Teachers have developed their responsiveness to Pacific children and families. Cultural celebrations, artefacts, displays and experiences support and affirm Pacific identities, as well as enriching the programme for all children. </p><p>Transition-to-school processes are very well considered. Teachers present workshops and provide useful resources to parents. A close working relationship has been established with the local school.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are highly reflective and improvement-focused. They regularly collaborate to review their practice, consulting with parents and using current research to inform ongoing improvements. The service has recently adopted a new guiding framework, which should raise the evaluative quality of review. A next step is to fully embed this new system. Leaders agree that future evaluations should be more sharply focused on measuring the impact of practices on children's outcomes.</p><p>Effective, distributed leadership is in place. Leaders and teachers engage in meaningful appraisal to continually enhance their practice. They take responsibility for contributing to the knowledge of the whole teaching team and ensuring consistent practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has confidence that through the implementation of robust internal evaluation, the service has the capacity to identify its next steps and monitor improvements. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4><strong>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</strong></h4><p>The next ERO review of Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>17 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
