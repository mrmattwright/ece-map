<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Totara Park Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. While the centre has a high proportion of new members, sound and committed leadership coupled with well developed support from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), places it in a good position to build, sustain and improve practice.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association&rsquo;s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>Each week the centre runs one SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education) session for infants and their parents and four mixed-age sessions. Paid supervisors are employed three days per week.</p><p>Many families are relatively new to this service and are learning about Playcentre philosophy and operation. Commitment to training is high with a large number working at course two (Te Puna) level and above.</p><p>The average age of children attending is around two years. Infant and toddler numbers continue to build while few children attend aged over three and a half. An ongoing challenge for members is retaining children through to school age.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. It has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Adults are responsive, supportive and involved. They are particularly focused on promoting children&rsquo;s social and language learning. Many are building their confidence working as part of a team providing learning experiences for children. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for one-to-one interaction.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials which are well organised and freely available to children. The outdoor area supports physically active play and adventurous activities. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme in the context of play. A positive and calm tone is evident. Children display a strong sense of belonging and ownership of the environment. Many sustain their interest and engagement in play for long periods.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well integrated into sessions with parents supporting each other to provide for their care and learning. Older children are encouraged to look out for and care for those younger. Members are aware that with growing numbers of infants at the centre, adaptations to the programme and environment will be necessary.</p><p>Members&rsquo; inclusive approach provides good support for the diverse range of learning needs. They welcome and value adults and children from all cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The association actively promotes bicultural partnership. Members at this centre express commitment to ongoing development of this aspect of their practice. A M&#257;ori perspective is evident in the centre environment and programme. Children use karakia and waiata as part of their regular routines.</p><p>Planning for learning is well supported by more experienced members. A particular focus is helping parents to identify and plan around children&rsquo;s interests and special learning moments. An increasing number are compiling learning records about their children. Termly and daily discussions enable everyone to share information about individuals and collaboratively plan for future sessions.</p><p>Committed leadership is supporting good practice and positive outcomes for children. The friendly culture and emphasis on building strong relationships and support for each other, foster parents&rsquo; confidence and willingness to become involved. Their sense of belonging and commitment to playcentre philosophy point to a positive future for this service.</p><p>Self review is valued and promoted by the association. Good frameworks are in place to support practice at centre level. Long-term plans identify priorities for operation.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection of practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. This centre makes good use of association systems and processes to ensure legislative requirements are met, good practice is sustained and improvement is promoted.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further development is needed to strengthen members&rsquo; understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the learning in activities</li>
<li>developing assessment records for all children</li>
<li>ensuring that written daily evaluations are learning focused</li>
<li>using evaluation to determine how the planned and daily programmes have made a difference to children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Members need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. Strategic goals could be more closely linked to children's learning, the philosophy and ongoing review of major aspects of practice. Support to use some association frameworks more effectively, particularly those that build quality improvement, should strengthen their approach.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Totara Park Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
