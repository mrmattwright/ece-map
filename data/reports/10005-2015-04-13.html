</table><p>Burgundy Park Preschool would benefit from external support to help leaders develop strategic planning and management practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Burgundy Park Preschool is located in a residential area in Henderson. It caters for 25 children over two years of age and offers full day and sessional education and care. The centre operates from a renovated home and has a spacious outdoor area.</p><p>The owner employs a number of qualified teachers who are family members. This helps to promote the family-friendly approach of the service. Teachers place a high priority on building positive relationships with whƒÅnau, from diverse backgrounds. The programme continues to operate as a blend of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Montessori teaching philosophy.</p><p>At the time of this review, the service was transitioning to a more distributed leadership approach to managing the centre. External professional development for the leadership team would help to develop capability to support continual improvement. Centre leaders are positive about working with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and ERO to support their management of necessary changes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive interactions and relationships with welcoming, friendly teachers. At the start of the day, children settle quickly and know the centre‚Äôs routines. Teachers show care and compassion for children and their families. Conversations with families are respectful and the wellbeing of children is a centre priority.</p><p>Teachers promote children's social skills well. Teachers listen to children and encourage their oral language development. Teachers also promote children's literacy and numeracy in the indoor programme very well. They could now focus on developing other areas of mathematical and scientific thinking.</p><p>MƒÅori children benefit from a supportive and inclusive environment. Increasingly teachers are developing their use of te reo MƒÅori and affirming MƒÅori children‚Äôs heritage. They could continue to find ways to include te ao MƒÅori in children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers have good knowledge of Pacific children‚Äôs culture and heritage. They plan cultural learning experiences to help promote children‚Äôs identity and to respond to families' aspirations. Pacific children would further benefit by teachers using a range of relevant Pacific languages, in the daily programme.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Centre leaders are good advocates on their behalf and work closely with families. Ongoing communication with families is deliberate and focused on providing effective transitions into and from the centre.</p><p>Analysis of individual children‚Äôs learning has improved in recent years. Portfolios are attractive and useful records of children's learning. Teachers could show the learning links between stories to highlight children‚Äôs progress to whƒÅnau. Increasing ways to document whƒÅnau input about their child‚Äôs learning is a key centre goal.</p><p>Teachers and leaders could further use individual children‚Äôs assessment records to create a programme that is more flexible and responsive to children‚Äôs interests. Centre leaders should review the overall structure of the day. The majority of the morning learning programme is focused on indoor activities. Making better use of outdoor learning opportunities and reducing interruptions to children's learning could better meet the learning objectives of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>The centre has a useful policy and procedure framework to help guide service operations. However, most of the current funding is allocated to staffing. The budget for programme resources and teachers‚Äô professional development requires attention.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed self-review processes to identify ways to improve learning for children. They are currently reviewing teachers‚Äô appraisal processes. Due to the number of family members employed in the service, external appraisal for the owner, centre manager and staff would improve personnel management, minimise conflicts of interest and provide useful external feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are committed to improving the service and demonstrate a high level of responsiveness to ERO‚Äôs evaluation. To further improve outcomes for children, ERO and centre leaders agree the service could use external support to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>strategic planning to guide resourcing management and the centre‚Äôs continual improvement</li>
<li>personnel and performance management practices</li>
<li>professional learning to promote leadership and teaching capability</li>
<li>teachers‚Äô self review by using best teaching practice indicators</li>
<li>programme planning to provide a more responsive curriculum that reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Burgundy Park Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, governance and hazard management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum planning to respond to children‚Äôs interests and enhances their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resource management to ensure resources best support children‚Äôs learning interests and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adult supervision outdoors, fencing and the provision of shade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provision of a quiet, well ventilated space for children to sleep or rest indoors.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, C7, C9, PF13, PF33, GMA7, GMA9, Education Act 1989.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Burgundy Park Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
