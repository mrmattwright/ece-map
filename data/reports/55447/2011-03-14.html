<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend) Tauranga, is a quality-funded network providing home-based care and education for children from birth to school age. It operates alongside the standard-funded sister network. Both services are administered by the same management staff and supported by the PORSE National Support Office systems, administrational guidelines and policy framework. Children are cared for in their own homes by a nanny, or in the homes of educators. Nanny and parent educators are self employed and contracted to the PORSE network.</p><p>The service is owned by a franchisee (coach) who is providing sound management and holds high expectations for all PORSE stakeholders. A cohesive team of three registered teachers (programme tutors) provide support and professional guidance to network educators who include parents, grandparents and nannies. This team operates collegially and is dedicated to providing a quality service.</p><p>Children and their families are welcomed into diverse and well-presented homes. Educators and children demonstrate caring and respectful interactions. Children are confident and settled in educators‚Äô homes and enjoy trusting relationships within their care environment. They participate alongside their educators in interesting activities such as planned playgroups and routine excursions. Children‚Äôs strengths and interests form the basis of their learning. There are many opportunities for children to develop their early literacy and mathematics concepts. Babies and toddlers receive nurture and care in safe and secure environments.</p><p>To sustain continual improvement to the quality of education provided, the franchisee needs to ensure that qualified teachers (programme tutors):</p><ul>
<li>more consistently share their professional knowledge about programme planning and self review with educators and families; and</li>
<li>implement policies, objectives and practices which reflect the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua and are consistent with PORSE National Support Office expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Tauranga was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Tauranga.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend) Tauranga, 55447 is a ‚Äòquality network‚Äô because all educators have a recognised home-based care qualification. The service provides home-based care and education for children from birth to school age. Children are cared for in their own homes by a nanny, or in the homes of educators who are contracted to the PORSE network. ERO‚Äôs judgements about the quality of education and care are based on visits to five parent and nanny educators chosen by PORSE to represent a cross section of homes. The service aims to provide safe, settled home environments that support early brain development and adult-supported relationships for life-long learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Management:</strong> The PORSE National Support Office is providing high quality guidelines for the effective administration and management of the network. The franchisee has established high expectations and sound management practices for the Tauranga network of programme tutors and educators. A dedicated administrator works effectively to support and inform educators and families. An experienced consultant works closely with families and educators, and endeavours to match each child with an educator who meets the needs and expectations of parents and children. Management personnel and practices contribute to the consistency of service provided for children and their families.</p><p><strong>Care and learning environments:</strong> Children and their families are welcomed into diverse and well-presented homes. In addition, PORSE programme tutors make good use of the local community environment to facilitate regular playgroups and activities for educators and children. Educators supply a range of appropriate resources for children‚Äôs exploration and play. PORSE also provides support for educators with nursery furniture, push chairs and documentation to monitor the care and learning environment in each home.</p><p><strong>Relationships and interactions:</strong> Educators and children demonstrate caring and respectful interactions. Children are confident and settled in educators‚Äô homes and enjoy trusting relationships. Parents who responded to the ERO survey were highly supportive of the contribution made by educators, programme tutors and management to the quality of education and care provided. Open and transparent communication ensures parents are well informed about their child‚Äôs daily activities and wellbeing. Programme tutors provide useful modelling and guidance for educators in their work with children. PORSE programme tutors, administration and management staff demonstrate collegial, professional relationships as they undertake their respective roles in supporting educators and families.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> Children participate in an interesting programme of both planned and spontaneous activities alongside educators that includes:</p><ul>
<li>meaningful learning experiences such as gardening, cooking, daily routines and excursions into the community;</li>
<li>music activities;</li>
<li>opportunities to make decisions about their learning and pursue their interests over time;</li>
<li>playgroups and nature sessions facilitated by programme tutors;</li>
<li>wider social opportunities through meeting with other educators and their children and;</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop early literacy and mathematics skills.</li>
</ul><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p><strong>Self review:</strong> There is a need to strengthen self-review processes to more effectively evaluate and improve the quality of education being provided for children and their families. Consideration should be given to maximising the potential of the skills that the qualified programme tutors bring in order to improve:</p><ul>
<li>the documenting of assessment, planning and evaluation to clearly show the purpose of learning, children‚Äôs strengths and interests and the progress and development of each child;</li>
<li>the opportunities for families to discuss the progress and development of children and participate in decision-making processes;</li>
<li>the use of Ministry of Education guiding documents such as the Home-based Care Curriculum and Quality in Action to support educators‚Äô knowledge about current best practice in early childhood education;</li>
<li>the robustness of health and safety checks; and</li>
<li>the quality and use of resources provided to extend educators‚Äô and children‚Äôs identified interests and learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 National Evaluation Topic</span></h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau, particularly when the child and whƒÅnau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>At the time of the review thirteen children enrolled in this service identified as MƒÅori.</p><h4>Area of strength</h4><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Relationships and interactions are welcoming and positive for MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau, as for all families who attend the service.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><strong>MƒÅori as tangata whenua:</strong> The last ERO report in 2006 identified the need for the service to more effectively implement a bi-cultural perspective. Little progress has been made and there remains an urgent need to ensure MƒÅori language and culture are more highly valued and visible at all levels of service operations. These improvements are consistent with PORSE national policy guidelines, which are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase participation of MƒÅori;</li>
<li>work more closely with MƒÅori communities; and</li>
<li>reflect the bicultural nature of New Zealand in training programme delivery.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of PORSE Tauranga completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>

</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><p>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</p><p>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</p><p>staff qualifications and organisation; and</p><p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><p>During the course of the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance. In order to address this, centre managers must:</p><ol>
<li>ensure premises comply with the provisions set out in the Home-based Care order.¬†<em>[Education (Home-based Care) Order 1992 c2(1)].</em></li>
</ol><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ol>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-tauranga" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Tauranga</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office‚Äôs latest report on PORSE Tauranga.</p><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend) Tauranga, is a quality-funded network providing home-based care and education for children from birth to school age. It operates alongside the standard-funded sister network. Both services are administered by the same management staff and supported by the PORSE National Support Office systems, administrational guidelines and policy framework. Children are cared for in their own homes by a nanny, or in the homes of educators. Nanny and parent educators are self employed and contracted to the PORSE network.</p><p>The service is owned by a franchisee (coach) who is providing sound management and holds high expectations for all PORSE stakeholders. A cohesive team of three registered teachers (programme tutors) provide support and professional guidance to network educators who include parents, grandparents and nannies. This team operates collegially and is dedicated to providing a quality service.</p><p>Children and their families are welcomed into diverse and well-presented homes. Educators and children demonstrate caring and respectful interactions. Children are confident and settled in educators‚Äô homes and enjoy trusting relationships within their care environment. They participate alongside their educators in interesting activities such as planned playgroups and routine excursions. Children‚Äôs strengths and interests form the basis of their learning. There are many opportunities for children to develop their early literacy and mathematics concepts. Babies and toddlers receive nurture and care in safe and secure environments.</p><p>To sustain continual improvement to the quality of education provided, the franchisee needs to ensure that qualified teachers (programme tutors):</p><ul>
<li>more consistently share their professional knowledge about programme planning and self review with educators and families; and</li>
<li>implement policies, objectives and practices which reflect the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua and are consistent with PORSE National Support Office expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> ‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> ‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> ‚Äì This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> ‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
