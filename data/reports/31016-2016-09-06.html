</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wharepuhunga Playcentre is an early childhood service run by a parent cooperative. It operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association. It serves a rural community and is situated south of Te Awamutu and adjacent to Korakanui Primary School. The centre runs three sessions a week for children from birth to school age. One of these is the 'Big Kids Session' led by an employed supervisor. Since the 2013 ERO review, significant funding has been sourced to upgrade the environment and resources.</p><p>The playcentre is licensed for 30 children with a maximum of 15 under two years of age. The current roll is 25, and all children identify as PƒÅkehƒÅ. A number of new families have enrolled in the playcentre. A strategic priority for the playcentre is to increase the number of children and families enrolled.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association continue to provide effective governance, strategic direction, management support and adult education programmes for the centre.</p><p>The playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO and effectively responded to areas for development identified in the 2013 report.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to provide quality early childhood education 'through child-initiated play with children and whƒÅnau learning and playing together'. The playcentre philosophy is highly evident in the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the King Country Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whƒÅnau benefit from a welcoming, inclusive and family-like culture at the playcentre. This fosters a strong sense of belonging and encourages parents and whƒÅnau to take an active role in their children's learning. Relationships are respectful, and adults listen and respond to children's ideas and interests. Tuakana-teina relationships are nurtured in the mixed-age group sessions as children learn alongside their siblings and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children choose freely from a wide range of activities in the indoor and outdoor learning areas. Children are developing as competent, confident learners as they follow their own interests, and are supported to explore and investigate by interested adults.</p><p>The programme is responsive to children's interests and integrates early skills and concepts in literacy. Children actively participate in storytelling, and are encouraged to express their ideas through creative and imaginative play. Mathematical skills are promoted as children investigate and problem solve. Areas of play such as carpentry, construction, baking activities and the extensive range of puzzles facilitates this learning. Science concepts are explored in the natural world as children observe plants, insects and animals in their surrounding environment. Children learn through play in meaningful contexts that respond to their home and rural community life.</p><p>The outdoor environment is spacious, attractive, well planned and inviting for children. It offers many opportunities to appreciate and explore the natural and physical world. Parents set up equipment to meet children's interests, provoke curiosity and provide physical challenges for all age groups. Children cooperate to redesign the environment to sustain their interests and further their play and learning.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are included in all aspects of the programme. They benefit from warm, caring relationships with all adults. Mothers' wellbeing is supported as they nurture and care for their babies and as they enjoy the company of other parents and whƒÅnau. Babies and toddlers have easy access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration, movement and intellectual stimulation through seeing, touching and hearing new things. This inclusive programme enables babies to develop their social and communication skills.</p><p>A feature of the playcentre is the close partnership with the local primary school. There are regular exchanges between the playcentre children and students at the school. These experiences stimulate and extend children's learning opportunities, and build their confidence in preparation for their transition to school.</p><p>All adults are engaged in playcentre education programmes that empower them to be well-informed, first educators of their children. The high ratio of adults to children ensures quality learning conversations with adults that listen and extend children's vocabulary, and use open-ended questions to further develop their oral language and communication skills.</p><p>Leaders have created a culture where children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Emergent leadership is fostered and new members are well supported to take on roles and responsibilities. The parent support network is an integral part of the playcentre culture. The centre support person provides inspiration and motivation. This approach is contributing to professional leadership about teaching and learning. There are opportunities to share good practice from other centres and support for members undertaking new roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association continue to provide good quality governance and management. The association provides comprehensive policies and guidelines, and employs a centre support person who assists families to operate the service in the best interests of children and their parents and whƒÅnau. The benefits of this support would be made more evident if a process was introduced to provide regular formal reports on the quality of centre programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The playcentre and ERO agree that the next steps for the service are to work with the Association centre support person to review and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the purpose of individual portfolios to ensure they clearly identify children's learning and progress, and allow children to revisit and share their experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the assessment, planning and evaluation process, giving particular attention to adding complexity to individual children's ideas and interests over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the understanding and inclusion of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reporting of the quality of centre programmes to whƒÅnau/parents and association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wharepuhunga Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wharepuhunga Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>6 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
