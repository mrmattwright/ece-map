</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tiny Wonders is a large centre in Pukekohe. It is licensed to provide care and education for 150 children with up to 28 under two years of age. The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on providing a family orientated learning environment influenced by Magda Gerber approaches. The owner‚Äôs aspirations for teaching and learning are clearly outlined in information provided to parents.</p><p>The centre has two large buildings on the same property. One building caters for four year old children and the other caters for younger children. Each area has its own outdoor playground area. A large indoor play area allows physical development of children‚Äôs skills all year round.</p><p>The centre manager leads a collaborative team of registered teachers from diverse backgrounds. Team leaders have responsibility for care routines and programme implementation for the different age groups. Teachers have leadership opportunities within the centre‚Äôs organisation structure.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified a significant number of areas for development. This report acknowledges the progress made in many of these areas with support from an external professional development provider. The report also outlines further improvements that would benefit children‚Äôs education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and happy in the centre. They form friendships through the play that occurs in small and large groups. Children have freedom to explore in an environment that provides challenges and interest to them.</p><p>Teachers support the children with clearly defined expectations to help them develop self responsibility. Teachers‚Äô consistent approaches support children as they transition through the centre, particularly at the beginning and end of the day when children of mixed ages play together.</p><p>Good quality assessment practices are used to monitor children‚Äôs learning. Teachers use sensitive observation of children at play to understand their strengths and interests. They share well written learning stories with children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>The programme provides a varied range of experiences for the children. Children have opportunities to focus on their chosen activities for sustained periods of time. This extended focus supports them to develop persistence, extend their learning, and master new skills, especially in the older age-group areas.</p><p>Teachers have caring and purposeful learning relationships with children and adults, and everyone‚Äôs contribution is valued. Teachers support children to experiment and problem solve, and they affirm their efforts and success. Good support is provided for children with special learning needs and for their families.</p><p>Children under two years of age are cared for in a large purposefully resourced play area. They readily find resources and activities that interest them. These younger children are welcomed by teachers who foster nurturing relationships with them to help in their growth and development. The importance of play as a vehicle for learning is valued and respected.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives and a better understanding of MƒÅori values are becoming more evident in the centre through teachers building their understanding of children‚Äôs diverse cultures. Teachers could now include these perspectives in their programme planning.</p><p>Teachers are supported to develop their professional knowledge and leadership skills. Leaders have developed appraisal processes to help teachers set goals and strategise ways to achieve them. Leaders recognise that a next step is to more consistently implement the performance appraisal system to help all teachers achieve higher quality learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders agree that they could more actively seek parent perspectives in centre self review. This inclusion would help to build partnerships with parents. Greater sharing with parents about<em>Te Whariki</em> the early childhood curriculum would also be useful in when reviewing the effectiveness of the centre‚Äôs transition to school programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Changes made following the 2013 ERO report have had a significant impact on centre practices. Ongoing external support would be worthwhile to help the managers and teachers to build on this recent progress.</p><p>Leaders agree that key next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening strategic and annual planning by including indicators of success for children's learning</li>
<li>integrating aspects of literacy, mathematics and science into programme planning and implementation</li>
<li>developing more evaluative and consultative self-review practices.¬†</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tiny Wonders Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tiny Wonders Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>

</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
