</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rockdale Park Kindergarten is licensed for 37 children. Currently there are 39 children attending all-day, morning or afternoon sessions. Children come from a diverse range of cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>There is an expectation that children and their families‚Äô backgrounds will be respected and highly visible in the environment. Children play in an attractive and well-resourced environment. They show a strong sense of belonging to their kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy and vision aims to support children to develop a sense of belonging through respectful relationships. Children are to be seen as competent and capable learners. Teachers support children to become explorers, problem solvers, decision makers and creators.</p><p>The kindergarten has made very good progress in addressing the areas for review and development identified in the 2010 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers understand and demonstrate the importance of having meaningful relationships with children and their families. They are supportive, affirming and caring of the children and work in partnership with the parents. ERO observed thoughtful relationships between the children. They are helpful and cooperate with each other.</p><p>Adults and children interact with each other respectfully. Teachers know the children well. This knowledge helps them know to when to interact and when to stand back and allow children to continue with their play, conversations and learning. Teachers effectively build children‚Äôs sense of responsibility and self-management skills through a range of useful approaches.</p><p>Teachers have carefully created an environment where parents feel welcome and comfortable to stay and be involved in their children‚Äôs learning. They use effective methods to gather parent‚Äôs views and ideas. These views and ideas are valued and included in the vision, curriculum and learning programmes where appropriate.</p><p>Children benefit from a very child-centred curriculum. Key features of the curriculum are:</p><ul>
<li>developing children‚Äôs social competencies and preferred ways of learning</li>
<li>the purposeful links between relevant Ministry of Education documents including Te WhƒÅriki, The New Zealand Curriculum and He Reo Tupu, Te Reo Ora</li>
<li>the way MƒÅori perspectives are an important part of the kindergarten protocols and children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>the meaningful links teachers make between prior and new learning</li>
<li>the authentic inclusion of literacy and mathematics in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have introduced several innovative programmes to respond to the children‚Äôs identified needs.</p><p>The interests of children, parents and teachers initiate many learning experiences. Teachers have effective planning and assessment processes. These include:</p><ul>
<li>systematically ensuring that all children‚Äôs learning is planned for and regularly assessed</li>
<li>regularly gathering the parents‚Äô aspirations for their child</li>
<li>using parent and teacher information when planning for the child‚Äôs future learning.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers‚Äô next step is to enhance these systems by being more consistent in evaluating the impact on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The head teacher provides strong leadership and has established a culture of ongoing improvement.</p><p>Teachers reflect on their practices. The way self review is to be carried out is clearly documented. To improve self review teachers should further develop their understanding of the difference between reviewing progress and developing practices.</p><p>The clear alignment between the kindergarten philosophy, vision, strategic and action planning, and children‚Äôs learning sustains the current level of high performance.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long- term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten‚Äôs outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in attractive and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Lindisfarne Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rockdale Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rockdale Park Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>20 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
