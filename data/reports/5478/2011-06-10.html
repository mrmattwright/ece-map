<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Rhona Day Free Kindergarten is located in the rural community of Temuka, South Canterbury. It is one of the ten kindergartens administered and governed by the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association. It operates five mornings and three afternoons per week.</p>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review, there have been significant changes to the association management, and to the teaching team. The kindergarten benefits from the effective governance and management systems now in place at the association level. The teachers have had extensive professional development to assist them with assessment, planning, evaluation and self review.</p>
<p>The kindergarten philosophy focuses on providing an environment that empowers children to develop their sense of being competent, confident and capable learners. Teachers have positive, warm and responsive relationships with children. Children benefit from opportunities for sustained interactions with and alongside others.</p>
<p>Regular opportunities to connect with local schools and the wider community are an integral aspect of the programme.</p>
<p>Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p>
<ul><li>a spacious well-planned environment</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s learning made highly visible and valued</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; interactions support, and affirm children&rsquo;s developing social competence</li>
<li>teachers and children having fun together.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers foster opportunities for children to understand the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p>
<p>The teachers and ERO agree that the next steps for the kindergarten relate mainly to consolidating and building on assessment, planning and evaluation practices, and improving self review.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the kindergarten again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Rhona Day Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Rhona Day Free Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Rhona Day Free Kindergarten aims to provide an environment which empowers children to develop their sense of being competent, confident and capable learners. Children are encouraged to contribute and participate in a child-centred programme learning at their own pace. Teachers aim to use rich language that encourages children&rsquo;s verbal communication skills. There is an expectation of care and respect for one another.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<h5>Connecting parents and community</h5>
<p>Teachers foster respectful, reciprocal relationships with children, families and the community. They demonstrate inclusive practices that are responsive to the needs and preferences of children and families. Children and their families are warmly welcomed. Teachers know children and their families well and make meaningful connections between home and kindergarten. They share information with families to support children&rsquo;s well-being and learning. Teachers make purposeful links to the community to provide experiences for children and their families. This includes excursions into the community, visitors to the kindergarten and positive links to support children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p>
<h5>Teachers&rsquo; interactions</h5>
<p>Teachers affirm and respond to children in positive ways. They encourage children to care for themselves, others and the environment. Teachers and children have fun together. Children have many opportunities to make their own decisions and choices in the programme. Teachers offer ideas to encourage children&rsquo;s imaginative and cooperative play. ERO observed examples of teachers making use of effective questioning to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. Opportunities for children to hear teachers use complex language help to consolidate and build on children&rsquo;s vocabulary, and conversation skills. Teachers use some te reo M&#257;ori in their interactions with children.</p>
<h5>Social competence</h5>
<p>Children include others in their play, share ideas and enjoy opportunities to develop friendships. They maintain their play for extended periods. Teachers support and guide children&rsquo;s developing social competence, and provide good strategies to promote this. Children are familiar with the routines and expectations of the kindergarten. They demonstrate a good sense of belonging. Children make their own choices and settle into the day quickly. ERO observed children playing well independently in sustained dramatic play.</p>
<h5>Learning Environment</h5>
<p>Teachers place resources purposefully to encourage children&rsquo;s involvement and participation in a wide range of activities. Children are actively involved in a high quality, calm, spacious environment. There are many possibilities to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices. Teachers support children to take part in a range of creative and imaginative play. There is a good range of natural materials and resources for children to use. Children actively contribute by caring for the environment, making decisions and altering learning areas to extend on their own ideas.</p>
<h5>Learning made visible</h5>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning interests are strongly reflected and valued in displays that are informative and meaningful. Teachers make good use of moveable learning displays to invite and inspire participation in the programme, and to support children&rsquo;s language skills. There are many opportunities for children to revisit prior learning experiences. Extensive use of photos capture children&rsquo;s interests and involvement in the programme. Group happenings are celebrated.</p>
<h5>Governance, management and leadership</h5>
<p>The kindergarten benefits from the effective governance and management systems now in place at association level. The management team&rsquo;s strategic approach is informed by current research, and is focused on teaching and learning. There is a positive and effective working relationship between the board and management team. High-quality professional leadership is supporting the development of a reflective and collaborative culture. Teachers have good access to relevant and ongoing professional development.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<h5>Assessment, planning and evaluation</h5>
<p>The teaching team has identified that the next step is to build on assessment, planning and evaluation practices to support teaching and learning. This includes:</p>
<ul><li>identifying more specific next steps for teaching and learning in individual assessment records</li>
<li>building a sense of progress in learning over time</li>
<li>developing systems for monitoring the regular assessment of all children</li>
<li>making better use of assessment information to plan the programme.</li>
</ul><h4>Building on self review</h4>
<p>Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step for building on self review is to evaluate the effectiveness of the reviews to ensure the focus is on teaching, and learning.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the kindergarten</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>The kindergarten programme affirms and values the dual heritage of Aotearoa/ New&nbsp;Zealand and seeks to ensure the bicultural practices are integral through the relationships with parents, wh&#257;nau and the community. Positive relationships have been established that create an environment where wh&#257;nau can contribute and be involved in the learning community.</p>
<p>Other strengths of this kindergarten are outlined in the body of the report, particularly under the headings, connecting parents and community, and the learning environment.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>The teachers have identified they are at the early stages of building partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. They have identified and ERO agrees, that the next steps are:</p>
<ul><li>consolidating and making wider use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>strengthening partnerships with local M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Rhona Day Free Kindergarten completed an ERO and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-rhona-day-free-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Rhona Day Free Kindergarten</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Rhona Day Free Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Rhona Day Free Kindergarten is located in the rural community of Temuka, South Canterbury. It is one of the ten kindergartens administered and governed by the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association. It operates five mornings and three afternoons per week.</p>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review, there have been significant changes to the association management, and to the teaching team. The kindergarten benefits from the effective governance and management systems now in place at the association level. The teachers have had extensive professional development to assist them with assessment, planning, evaluation and self review.</p>
<p>The kindergarten philosophy focuses on providing an environment that empowers children to develop their sense of being competent, confident and capable learners. Teachers have positive, warm and responsive relationships with children. Children benefit from opportunities for sustained interactions with and alongside others.</p>
<p>Regular opportunities to connect with local schools and the wider community are an integral aspect of the programme.</p>
<p>Other positive features of this kindergarten include:</p>
<ul><li>a spacious well-planned environment</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s learning made highly visible and valued</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; interactions support, and affirm children&rsquo;s developing social competence</li>
<li>teachers and children having fun together.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers foster opportunities for children to understand the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p>
<p>The teachers and ERO agree that the next steps for the kindergarten relate mainly to consolidating and building on assessment, planning and evaluation practices, and improving self review.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the kindergarten again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each kindergarten&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this kindergarten.</p></html>
