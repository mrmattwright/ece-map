</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cambridge Kindergarten is located in Cambridge and provides sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 80 children were enrolled, of whom five are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‚ÄòEvery child reaching their full potential‚Äô. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten‚Äôs quality of education. A kaumƒÅtua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about MƒÅori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten‚Äôs administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The qualified teaching team of four includes the experienced head teacher and three other teachers who have joined the team since the 2011 ERO review. Since that time, teachers have continued to refine assessment processes, strengthen bicultural perspectives and enhance the learning environment. The kindergarten has also celebrated its 50th anniversary with the wider community.</p><p>Teachers aim to provide a warm, welcoming and culturally inclusive environment that fosters child-initiated learning and exploration, and supports children to care for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Cambridge Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children are capable, competent and independent learners. They are enthusiastic, adventurous and confidently engage in complex child-led learning. Children confidently communicate ideas and opinions and display well-developed social skills. Children are highly creative and skilled at using tools and materials to achieve their ideas. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging, humour and enjoyment of learning.</p><p>Teachers' relationships and interactions with children and their families are trusting, respectful and caring. They make good use of learning conversations to extend children‚Äôs thinking and communication skills. Teachers respond enthusiastically to children‚Äôs emerging interests and experiences outside of the kindergarten. They place a strong emphasis on supporting children to plan and develop strategies to achieve their ideas. Teachers value and affirm children‚Äôs independence, strengths and capabilities.</p><p>The holistic and inclusive curriculum is well-designed to promote high-quality learning outcomes for all children. Strengths include the integration of literacy, mathematics and natural science throughout the programme and the use of computer technologies to support learning. Teachers effectively integrate bicultural perspectives. Flexible routines and regular celebrations, trips and community events also enrich children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The spacious and well-designed environment has a positive impact on children‚Äôs learning. Teachers skilfully resource and present the environment to stimulate children‚Äôs curiosity and invite investigation and exploration. Children have independent access to an abundant variety of high-quality materials and equipment. The environment provides extensive opportunities for children to engage in imaginative play, make choices, and to extend their physical capabilities. Teachers provide meaningful and practical ways for children to learn about sustainability and caring for the environment.</p><p>Strong partnerships between the teaching team, parents and the wider community are key factors in the kindergarten‚Äôs ongoing success and sustainability. Parents are very satisfied with the service that the kindergarten provides. Teachers keep parents well informed about their children‚Äôs education and learning through displays and learning folders. Children enjoy revisiting and sharing their learning and success with others. Teachers are exploring strategies, including the use of e-portfolios, to enhance their sharing of learning with families.</p><p>The experienced head teacher continues to provide effective professional leadership with the support of ESM‚Äôs knowledge and experience. The recently reviewed kindergarten philosophy reflects the new teaching team‚Äôs strong and united commitment to child-centred learning. Teachers work collaboratively making effective use of their diverse strengths, interests and specialist knowledge to enhance children‚Äôs learning. The team also makes effective use of self review and professional learning and development to sustain ongoing improvement and build their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the teaching team agree that there would be benefits in teachers reviewing assessment and planning processes. Particular focus on developing ways to further reflect children‚Äôs culture and identity and parents' contributions to portfolios is likely to have positive outcomes for children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cambridge Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cambridge Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
