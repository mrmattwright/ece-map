<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">St Heliers Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides management systems and guidance as well as on-going professional development and support. The kindergarten provides education for five mornings and three afternoons each week. Each session caters for 45 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">Changes to staffing noted in the 2009 ERO report have continued. There have been three head teachers since 2009. While these changes have made it difficult for teachers to sustain good teaching practices, teachers are now beginning to work as a cohesive team. Recent professional development has been beneficial and teachers appreciate the professional leadership of the new head teacher.</p><p align="left">Children know the routines well and are able to make choices about their play. Friendships are evident and many children play in small groups together. Teachers provide a wide range of activities for children, who sample most play areas during the session.</p><p align="left">Teachers have recently redeveloped their teaching philosophy. Increasing use of self review focused on meeting children&rsquo;s needs and interests will help teachers to implement the philosophy in all aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s operations.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well designed. Teachers have created an attractive and interesting indoor playing space. Playing areas have been carefully placed to encourage children to extend their play. Teachers now need to consider ways of ensuring that children are engaged in activities that are meaningful to them. Teachers can help to generate a sense of belonging and ownership through conversations with children that value children&rsquo;s input and support their thinking.</p><p align="left">Many of the processes in the kindergarten have yet to be embedded effectively. Increased self review should help teachers to make more informed decisions about the effectiveness of teaching and learning and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of St Heliers Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSt Heliers Kindergarten</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2009 ERO report identified a number of areas for improvement, including the quality of conversations with children, and the quality of planning and assessment processes.</p><p align="left">The new head teacher has been in her position for a short period. She has restarted assessment and planning processes that allow teachers to gather meaningful information about children&rsquo;s learning. These processes are in the early stages.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s play. Children settle quickly at the start of the day. They choose where they want to play from the wide range of activities provided for them. There are lots of opportunities for children to explore and investigate, supported by good quality and plentiful resources. Friendships are evident with some children playing together for most of the session. Levels of conversation between children are high and some children are able to negotiate and cooperate in their games in a sustained way.</p><p align="left">Interactions. Teachers use questions to encourage children to respond to them and to check levels of understanding about their play. Children are eager to talk. Teachers also provide opportunities for children to make decisions about routines and let them contribute to mat-time experiences. Children participate with enthusiasm.</p><p align="left">Environment. The kindergarten environment is interesting and attractive. Changes in the outdoor area have created quiet spaces for children to play, and more exciting opportunities in the sandpit. Science and nature study feature well in the programme with opportunities for children to try out simple experiments, and plant flowers and vegetables. Children&rsquo;s artworks reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s focus on celebrating festivals that are important to families.</p><p align="left">Professional learning. Teachers plan activities for children and support their participation in learning new skills. Professional development undertaken by the teaching team has introduced new ideas about assessment and programme planning. Programmes are beginning to be based on children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers have recently enrolled in further professional development to continue improvements to portfolios.</p><p align="left">Leadership and self review. Teachers are beginning to work as a cohesive team. Relationships are friendly and teachers appreciate the leadership of the head teacher. Teachers have begun to use self-review processes to help with decision making about the programme. A recent review of some routines has resulted in children having some choice about snack times.</p><p align="left">Parent satisfaction. Parents spoken to during the review expressed their satisfaction with the kindergarten, the quality of relationships with teachers and the amount of information they receive about programmes. They value their children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">In discussion with teachers and management, the following areas were identified for development and review. Management agreed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further develop assessment and programme planning strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">recognise the various cultures of children attending the kindergarten in more visible ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">build a culture of respect and care for others to help the development of children&rsquo;s social skills and sense of belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">develop meaningful conversations with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">use self review to guide changes teachers are making.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">It would be useful for teachers to strengthen their review processes to guide the changes they want to make. Respect for children needs to be clearly at the forefront of reviews in order for teachers to make informed choices about the directions of the programme.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of St Heliers Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategies to encourage positive behaviour between children.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and the kindergarten teachers and management staff agree that whole-centre development should focus on embedding teaching and learning strategies to strengthen outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">27 April 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

The Association provides management systems and guidance as well as on-going professional development and support. The kindergarten provides education for five mornings and three afternoons each week. Each session caters for 45 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">Changes to staffing noted in the 2009 ERO report have continued. There have been three head teachers since 2009. While these changes have made it difficult for teachers to sustain good teaching practices, teachers are now beginning to work as a cohesive team. Recent professional development has been beneficial and teachers appreciate the professional leadership of the new head teacher.</p><p align="left">Children know the routines well and are able to make choices about their play. Friendships are evident and many children play in small groups together. Teachers provide a wide range of activities for children, who sample most play areas during the session.</p><p align="left">Teachers have recently redeveloped their teaching philosophy. Increasing use of self review focused on meeting children&rsquo;s needs and interests will help teachers to implement the philosophy in all aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s operations.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well designed. Teachers have created an attractive and interesting indoor playing space. Playing areas have been carefully placed to encourage children to extend their play. Teachers now need to consider ways of ensuring that children are engaged in activities that are meaningful to them. Teachers can help to generate a sense of belonging and ownership through conversations with children that value children&rsquo;s input and support their thinking.</p><p align="left">Many of the processes in the kindergarten have yet to be embedded effectively. Increased self review should help teachers to make more informed decisions about the effectiveness of teaching and learning and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
