</table><p>Mahurangi Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mahurangi Kindergarten is one of 15 early childhood services operating under the umbrella of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association, (the association) now trading as <span lang="mi">Kaitiaki Kindergartens</span>. The service is licensed for 40 children aged over two years and serves a diverse ethnic community. Some families have English as a second language. Of the 56 children enrolled, 8 are MƒÅori. Daily sessions are for a mixed-age group of children from two-to-five years.</p><p>A governing board sets strategic direction for the association. Management of the association‚Äôs affairs is the responsibility of the general manager (GM). Two professional practice leaders (PPL's) have oversight of teaching and learning, compliance, policy development and leadership. Day-to-day operation in this kindergarten is the responsibility of the head teacher who leads a team of four registered teachers.</p><p>Since the April 2016 ERO report, there has been turnover of personnel at board, management and senior leadership levels. Two of the four teachers have been employed since that time.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of reflecting/<span lang="mi">hinegaro, whakamana, manaakitanga and whanaungatanga</span> in daily practices.</p><p>Mahurangi Kindergarten is a member of the <span lang="mi">Mahurangi KƒÅhui Ako</span> l Community of Learning, and has attained bronze status in the Enviroschool programme.</p><p>The previous ERO evaluation identified the need to continue to strengthen evaluation of the curriculum in order to explicitly respond to the abilities and interests of all children. Progress has been made in this area.</p><p>This¬†review is one of nine in the Northern Auckland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The well-developed environment supports children to engage and participate in richly-resourced learning areas. These are thoughtfully organised to encourage children's interests and participation. The recently-designed oval garden was planned and planted by children. Sustainable practices are highly evident.</p><p>Children are engaged, motivated and imaginative. Science, literacy, mathematics and the arts are meaningfully integrated into the programme. Teachers are responsive and respectful. They appreciate the significance of children's developing ideas and interests. Positive guidance strategies are used well to promote settling, perseverance and social competence.</p><p>Group and individual planning, based on children's interests, successfully guides curriculum development. Children's portfolios are a useful record of their participation in the programme. These show the links between home and the kindergarten. Teachers should look for ways to discuss with parents their child's learning and show this in assessment documents. Strengthening teachers' ability to evaluate children's learning and show progress over time, is a next step.</p><p>Children's diverse cultures are celebrated in the kindergarten environment. The culture, language and identity of MƒÅori children are valued. Teachers have identified that they will continue to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of <span lang="mi">te reo MƒÅori me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</span>. The use of language and protocols in everyday practice, as well as seeking useful connections to develop their approach, should increase the confidence of teachers and children. Children's cultures need to be better reflected in assessment and planning documentation.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate highly inclusive practice. Children with additional learning needs are well supported to achieve success. Leaders and teachers carefully track, monitor and plan for their learning and development. They work alongside families to access association and external agencies' support when required. The responsive approach to parents and children with English as second language is evident. Parents are sensitively and warmly welcomed to the service.</p><p>Children and families' transitions into the kindergarten are well considered and thoughtfully managed by teachers. Continuing to strengthen relationships with local primary schools is an area of focus for teachers.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work collaboratively to make ongoing improvements for children's learning. Opportunities to develop leadership skills are encouraged. Review is valued and has often led to improvements within the environment and teacher practice. A stronger focus on evaluation of practices would better support decision making to measure the effectiveness of the changes made on improved learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The association has some good processes in place to support teachers. These include an improved inquiry-based appraisal, targeted learning and development opportunities, and access to PPLs' guidance. Assisting teachers to implement and embed the new policy framework and reporting requirements, and deciding on the form and function of the PPL role and how this will be enacted in kindergartens, are priorities.</p><p>With the appointment of a new board, GM and leadership team, considerable work has been done to review the existing management structures, processes and guidelines for operation, and to improve accountability. The board and GM should continue to review and develop governance and operational roles and responsibilities, in consultation with teachers and the community, to support the sustainability of operation and ensure continuous improvement to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for teachers are to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aspects of planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knowledge and use of <span lang="mi">te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the reflection of children's culture, language and identity in assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mahurangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>20 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
