</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>School of Fish Childcare opened in October 2013. The centre occupies a recently renovated villa in Onehunga, Auckland. It offers all day care and education for 60 children, including up to 12 children under two years of age.</p><p>The centre caters for children in three separate areas. The babies‚Äô area is located in an extension to the main house. An open plan area provides space for the next group of children up to three years old. The third area caters for four year olds, who join the open plan group each afternoon.</p><p>The owner/manager and acting manager work collaboratively to implement effective systems and policies to support the management and operation of the centre. All teachers are qualified and most are working towards full teacher registration.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy focuses on the provision of a child-centred environment that inspires learning, creativity and expression. This philosophy was developed with staff and has much potential to provide a sound foundation for guiding centre programmes and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers in the open space area know their children well and work alongside them as they explore their environment. Teachers are welcoming, respect children for who they are and are responsive to their needs. Children are well cared for and treated as individuals.</p><p>The environment is high quality and rich in natural materials. Children experience explorative, manipulative, creative and imaginative play and are mostly free to choose from a wide range of activities. They are encouraged to play cooperatively with their peers. Teachers are on hand to foster open-ended play and to encourage children‚Äôs interactions.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with children and parents to develop projects for inquiry that are based on observations of children at play. Teachers and children search out answers to overarching questions of interest to children.</p><p>Teachers develop useful assessment portfolios for each child. These portfolios show the development of each child‚Äôs knowledge, skills and dispositions over their time at the centre and include documentation of children‚Äôs involvement in group activities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well catered for in their own area. They benefit from a calm and affirming environment where teachers respond sensitively to their needs, preferences and their verbal and non-verbal cues. Children‚Äôs development in this area could be now be further enhanced through a greater emphasis by teachers on supporting their language acquisition.</p><p>The programme provided for older children is more structured. Children participate in teacher directed activities for the majority of the morning session. Consideration needs to be given to the alignment of this programme with the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It would be timely to review centre practices giving consideration to strategies to further support children's learning in authentic contexts and readiness to transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to improve their processes around teaching and learning. Worthwhile time and thinking has gone into establishing a child-centred philosophy. This shared philosophy should guide the direction, strategy and consistency of teaching practice.</p><p>The management team has developed useful strategic and annual management plans. These documents guide them as they continue to set up systems, structures, policies and procedures. The management team reflects on progress with these areas and uses these reflections to improve operations. The team has built the centre‚Äôs foundations well.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and manager acknowledge it would now be beneficial to:</p><ul>
<li>develop child-centred indicators for expectations of teaching practice that align with the centre philosophy</li>
<li>focus whole-centre teacher professional development on extending and challenging children‚Äôs knowledge, skills and learning dispositions.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of School of Fish Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of School of Fish Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
