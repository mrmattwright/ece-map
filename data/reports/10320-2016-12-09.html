</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Les Mills New Lynn Kids Club is set up each day in a second-floor gymnasium space to provide casual education sessions for preschool children. The centre opens for two hours for each week day morning.</p><p>The Kids Club licence has been extended to cater for up to 45 children of whom 15 can be under two years of age. Only children of gym members attend the centre and there is a clear expectation that the members do not leave the building while their child is in the centre. Children's attendance is generally irregular and teachers often don‚Äôt know which children will attend the session until they arrive.</p><p>While there is no outdoor play area, the indoor area is spacious. There is a carpeted space for children under two years of age, and a larger area for the older, more mobile children.</p><p>The Kids Club is managed by a head teacher who is well supported by the manager of the Les Mills gymnasium. The centre employs three other qualified teachers and one unqualified assistant. The head teacher is assisted with administration tasks by other Les Mills employees.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Les Mills New Lynn Kids Club is successfully meeting its intention of providing a 'home away from home' where children and their families enjoy a relaxed positive fun environment. Children experience a sense of well-being and belonging. The gym provides useful information to parents considering enrolling their children.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at settling the children and supporting them with activities they enjoy. They get to know the children and their families through discussions when the children arrive. Teachers involve the older children in conversations helping them to extend their play, sometimes encouraging children to engage in activities with others. They help children access additional resources.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They communicate well with one another to ensure that relevant information about the children and their families is shared with all staff. Teachers manage the distinct context of the centre well. They are efficient in setting up the environment each morning to provide a good range of resources and activities.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are respectful and teachers are responsive to children. Teachers working with babies support their individual routines related to sleep and feeding. Teachers provide appropriate resources and support children's development, especially their oral language.</p><p>Teachers use some te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children. The manager has identified that children would benefit from greater inclusion of aspects of MƒÅori culture in the programme and environment to support children and their families to participate in bicultural New Zealand. She would also like to have greater inclusion of the cultures of the community.</p><p>An effective process is used to review the areas of play. This informs changes to the programme to maximise learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Staff reflect on the programme at the end of each session. During this time teachers discuss children's learning and how effectively they have responded to children's interests. The documenting of these reflective conversations is variable. The processes of recording conversations with parents, as well as staff conversations at the end of each session, could be strengthened by revisiting the intentions of the procedures and the templates already available.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager agrees that the centre should review:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>personnel management policies and procedures, including staff appraisals, three-yearly police vetting, and staff induction information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of equipment such as car seats, high chairs and any other equipment that might unnecessarily restrain children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of documentation related to programme evaluation and planning, medication and evacuation procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies related to child protection and the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act 2014</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural and multicultural aspects of the programme and environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers should develop a plan of action to address these key steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Les Mills New Lynn Kids Club completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that staff are appraised annually against the Practicing Teacher Criteria and that all non-teaching staff are police vetted every three years.</p><p><em>State Sector Act 1988, section 77a, 77c.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Les Mills New Lynn Kids Club will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
