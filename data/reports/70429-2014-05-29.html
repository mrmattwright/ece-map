</table><p>Pioneer Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.  </p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pioneer Early Learning Centre is on the site of the Christchurch City Council’s Pioneer Leisure Complex in Spreydon. The centre has been purpose built and serves the local community, and those who use the adjacent leisure facilities. The licensee of the centre is the manager of the council’s community support unit. A senior teacher has responsibility for managing the day-to-day organisation of the centre. The council has decided to consult with the public about the future ownership of the centre.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, there have been some staff changes. This includes a new senior teacher and head teacher. Leaders and teachers have focused on providing a supportive and welcoming environment for children and their families. This includes offering casual care arrangements and parent education evenings on a range of subjects to support parents.</p><p>The leadership team has made recent progress with the recommendations from the 2010 ERO report. This includes strengthening teacher interactions and transition processes between the under-two and over-two areas; and increasing the range of resources. The new team is currently reviewing its philosophy, vision and values so that it better reflects the beliefs and practices of the team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers foster respectful, inclusive and warm relationships with children and whānau. Teachers work closely with parents to support children’s learning and wellbeing. They value parent and whānau contributions and involvement in the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a commitment to building on teaching practices that give greater prominence to increasing te ao Māori in the learning programme, practices and documentation.</p><p>Children are confident and show a good sense of belonging in a child-focused learning environment. Teachers are very caring and responsive to children’s individual interests, strengths and capabilities. They model care and respect for one another and for children. Teachers provide purposeful interactions that support children’s ability to participate in the learning programme and manage relationships with others.</p><p>Teachers have a positive view of the child as a capable learner. They encourage independence, thinking and problem solving skills. They present the indoor and outdoor learning areas in ways that inspire children’s curiosity and allow them to follow and build on their interests. Literacy and numeracy are integrated into the programme in practical and meaningful ways. Children have many opportunities to be involved in a wide range of new experiences and physical challenges. Regular visits into the local community enhance the learning programme and help children to make meaningful connections to the local environment. Teachers and children enjoy each other’s company and have fun together.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-planned, purposeful and supportive transition into the centre, between areas within the centre, and on to school.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for by permanent key teachers that support their wellbeing and sense of security. Teachers engage in one-to-one calm interactions, and unhurried routines, that are responsive to the individual preferences, interests and needs of infants and toddlers. They observe, listen carefully, and respond sensitively to children’s verbal and non verbal communication. Children have many opportunities to freely explore the environment and make their own discoveries.</p><p>Parents and whānau are well informed about children’s involvement in the programme through a range of ways. This includes attractively presented and informative wall displays and individual profile books.</p><p>The new leaders' team provide effective leadership to teachers. They have a strong focus on professional relationships that are based on trust and respect. Leaders foster collaborative ways of working with everyone in the service. They value and make good use of the strengths of the team.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to be highly reflective. Leaders have established regular processes to engage teachers in discussions that challenge, inform and grow their practice. Together they are developing ways to inquire more deeply, through self review, into teaching practices that provide positive learning outcomes for children. </p><p>The centre has effective governance and management systems to support the ongoing improvement and operation of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders have identified and ERO agrees that the key next steps are to continue to strengthen assessment, programme planning and evaluation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>providing a clear focus on learning outcomes and intentional teaching strategies,</li>
<li>increasing the involvement of parent and child voice in planning for learning</li>
<li>making children’s language, culture and identity more evident</li>
<li>reviewing how well mat and kai times meet the needs of individual children</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pioneer Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pioneer Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Southern Region</p><p>29 May 2014 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services.</a> <em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
