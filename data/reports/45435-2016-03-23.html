</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids, established in 2009, is owned by BestStart Educare Ltd. It is located in Te Hapara, Gisborne and caters for children aged from three months to school age. The centre is licensed for 120 children, including 20 up to two years of age.</p><p>Those children enrolled reflect the multicultural nature of the centre. Almost 50% identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has three separate areas. Pikopiko caters for children up to two years of age, and TƒÅkaro and ƒÄkonga have children from two years to school age.</p><p>The service uses equity funding to partially fund a van service to transport children from across Gisborne who might not otherwise attend the centre.</p><p>Since the February 2013 ERO report, a new manager and team members have been appointed. The centre has addressed all areas for development identified in the previous report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is evident in practice. Foremost is the intent to have a child-focused curriculum. Teachers work well together. They know the strengths and interests of each child and well considered planning leads to learning programmes that are responsive to individual and group interests.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging in the centre is promoted. Children respond with confidence to the respectful, familiar and unhurried routines. Teachers and children interact positively.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor areas are stimulating and well organised to make the most of space and ensure that a planned range of resources is readily accessible to children. Easy flow between indoor and outdoor spaces and the flexible arrangement of equipment and resources facilitate choice and promote self-management.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to make choices. Their independence is encouraged and self-help skills are fostered. The philosophy recognises natural resources are an important part of the environment for children's learning. Centre teams should further build on the availability of current natural resources, deepening opportunities for children.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy and science experiences are integrated into discussions and activities. Teachers provide a variety of opportunities for reading, writing, construction, exploration and dramatic play. A range of books is available and used well.</p><p>Teachers record children‚Äôs progress and learning in well-presented portfolios and displays. There is some variability in the way teachers do this. Generally they provide parents and whƒÅnau with useful information about their child's activities. Leaders agree the next steps are to document future learning strategies. The portfolios are accessible online for parents and whƒÅnau. This strategy has resulted in greater communication. To ensure all whƒÅnau and children have access to the portfolios, hard copies are available.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years are very well supported in a respectful, calm, well-resourced environment. The primary caregiver approach facilitates individual attention.</p><p>The centre is well placed to enhance transitions between rooms, with the proposed restructure to establish three age-related groups. Since ERO's previous review there is increased support for parents and their children when transitioning to school.</p><p>The majority of children are MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ. Both cultures are celebrated and teachers foster a sense of belonging. The centre's curriculum includes artefacts and opportunities to learn and use te reo MƒÅori through social interaction. Activities, stories, symbols, arts, crafts and events have connections with MƒÅori children‚Äôs lives.</p><p>A range of ethnic groups are enrolled in the centre, including Pacific and Asian children. Centre staff recognise the importance of good quality provision for the relatively large number of Tongan children and their families and they are introducing strategies to further increase their sense of belonging.</p><p>Leaders and teachers value their relationship with parents. There are good communication channels and many opportunities for consultation and whƒÅnau participation. Links are made with parents of children who travel in the centre vans. This may include social support and conversations about their child's education.</p><p>Physical activity is planned. Children regularly visit the local park and gymnasium for exercise and to practise skills. The centre is well supported by external agencies to promote physical wellbeing. The healthy heart programme has been introduced and a centre garden is a focus for education and promotion of positive attitudes to food and nutrition.</p><p>The centre is improvement focused. Internal evaluation follows the BestStart model and has resulted in change or affirmation of practice. The next step is to evaluate the impact, over time, of changes resulting from self review.</p><p>Managers and teachers are well supported by BestStart. Policies, procedures, strategic planning and oversight of record keeping provide a sustainable structure and promote practices to support children's wellbeing.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Lytton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have¬†taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Lytton will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

</div><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
