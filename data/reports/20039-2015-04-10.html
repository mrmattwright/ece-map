</table><p>The service would benefit from external support to improve the quality of the programme and consistency in effective teaching practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Daystar Early Learning Centre is a small centre in Mt Eden, Auckland that provides all day education and care for up to 35 children over two years old. The centre operates as part of the Eden Community Church and is governed by a management committee. Christian beliefs and values are reflected in the centre programme and the philosophy.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, several head teachers have managed the centre at different points in time. A new full-time head teacher was appointed in May 2014 and is having a stabilising influence on the teaching team. The management committee is about to appoint a new teacher. The long serving teaching team are trained and qualified teachers.</p><p>The management committee employs an outside facilitator who is managing teachers‚Äô performance appraisal. The committee has plans to upgrade the outdoor environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children explore the environment freely and make decisions about their own play choices. While teachers provide a good variety of activities for children to engage with, they largely supervise children rather than involving themselves in children‚Äôs play. Teachers would benefit from further guidance and modelling to help strengthen their understandings of their role in supporting children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Older children engage confidently in conversations with each other and with adults. Teachers skilfully use home languages to communicate with parents and children. A next step is to consider ways in which the programme for children could be significantly enhanced. Particular emphasis should be placed on raising the quality of teaching practices, especially to extend learning opportunities for older children.</p><p>Most three to five year old children participate in an activity-based preschool programme. Teachers take turns at managing this programme each day. Teachers have yet to review the programme to determine its effectiveness. They should consider how well it aligns with the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and its effectiveness in preparing children for school. It would also be useful for teachers to engage with local schools to jointly consider the features of an effective transition to school programme.</p><p>While appropriate assessment practices are in place, teachers are not yet using assessment records to provide children with programmes that support their ongoing learning. Teachers would benefit from further professional development in this area.</p><p>The head teacher has a sound understanding of the purpose of self review and the centre has some good review processes in place. Self-review could now be further improved through more robust reflection on the difference changes made have had on children‚Äôs learning. Involving teachers, parents, and the management committee in self-review processes could strengthen ongoing improvement.</p><p>The management committee voluntarily give their time to govern the centre. They make good use of internal and external expertise. In order to create a more sustainable model of governance and management, the committee should consider developing long-term plans that support the centre‚Äôs vision for children. Professional development could help members strengthen their understanding of their roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The management committee employ an outside facilitator to support and appraise teacher performance. Given the centre‚Äôs now stable teaching team, it would be useful to review this support and consider what role the head teacher could take in managing staff appraisal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that key next steps for ongoing centre development are:</p><ul>
<li>documenting long-term goals and plans to support ongoing centre improvement</li>
<li>improving teachers‚Äô knowledge of how to foster children‚Äôs learning and development through use of effective assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthening the centre‚Äôs bicultural curriculum and considering Ministry of Education resources that could help promote greater educational success for MƒÅori children, as MƒÅori</li>
<li>improving children‚Äôs transition to school through good practices aligned to the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></li>
<li>implementing robust systems for self review that are improvement focused.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Daystar Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>The management committee have identified that Daystar personnel, rather than the committee itself, should be managing finances for the centre. Consideration should also be given to reviewing policies and procedures that relate to finances once this change has been made.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>establish an annual plan to identify key goals and tasks to be carried out each year</li>
<li>ensure that the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children‚Äôs learning and interests</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA8, C2</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Daystar Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
