</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St John‚Äôs Hill Kindergarten is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children. It offers morning, afternoon and full day sessions operating from 8:30am to 3:30pm, with children starting from two and a half years of age. All teachers are qualified and registered with a range of teaching experiences.</p><p>The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is responsible to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two cultural advisors were recently appointed to support teachers to realise potential and success for MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>There has been sustained progress in relation to areas of improvement identified in the October 2012 ERO review. This has been well supported by focused professional learning and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy focuses on the priorities of confidence, practical life skills, creativity and problem solving, social competence and a sense of belonging. These are evident in inclusive and respectful practices that support the relationships teachers have with children and their families.</p><p>Children are well supported in a programme where they recognise themselves as competent and capable learners. They are active, enquiring and empowered to be independent. Their wellbeing and whƒÅnau aspirations are at the heart of decision making.</p><p>There are rich opportunities for children to develop their social skills. Teachers model supportive relationships and positive interactions. They encourage children to explore, challenge themselves and lead their play. Children with additional needs are well supported within the inclusive, welcoming environment.</p><p>The ‚ÄòPriorities for Children‚Äôs Learning‚Äô kindergarten initiative is guided by the senior teachers‚Äô response to a recent ERO national evaluation report. This comprehensive, sound and strategic framework is used to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation processes in each kindergarten and is guiding the programme with a focus on positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The programme is influenced by the aspirations parents and whƒÅnau have for their children. Teachers and families work in partnership to foster children‚Äôs sense of belonging. Parents are encouraged to be active learners and support their children‚Äôs learning. The kindergarten enriches its curriculum through its good links with the wider community.</p><p>Portfolios effectively show the progression of children‚Äôs learning and children‚Äôs individual and group interests. Revisiting whƒÅnau aspirations within the learning stories is an agreed next step.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are incorporated in teacher practice and routines. Leaders and teachers are committed to further developing the curriculum to promote success for MƒÅori children. ERO affirms this focus.</p><p>Children and their families are carefully transitioned into, through and from St John‚Äôs Hill Kindergarten. Very good links with local schools are part of a well-established transition programme.</p><p>A collaborative team culture is well supported by a shared approach to leadership. Teachers work collaboratively as a team, they reflect on their practice and their input is valued. As part of a shared approach to leadership, there are opportunities for teachers to take on key roles.</p><p>Appraisal effectively supports teachers‚Äô professional learning and development. Priorities for children‚Äôs learning, Practising Teacher Criteria, Professional Standards and <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural</em> <em>Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> are well aligned in the process.</p><p>A well structured framework is providing teachers with a clear understanding of the purpose and process for self review. They are making good use of self review to evaluate the impact of teaching and programmes on children‚Äôs learning, guide improvement and sustain effective practice. Leaders and teachers have identified the importance of further embedding the self-review framework to strengthen the quality of teaching to promote outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>refine aspects of assessment practice</li>
<li>strengthen teachers‚Äô knowledge and understanding of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</li>
<li>further embed understanding and use of self-review processes.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of the Whanganui Kindergarten Association is continuing to build teacher‚Äôs capability to be more responsive to MƒÅori and Pacific children‚Äôs culture, language and identity to enhance culturally responsive practices. ERO affirms this direction.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St John's Hill Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St John's Hill Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Central</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
