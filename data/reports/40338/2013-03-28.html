<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Above &amp; Beyond Education &amp; Care centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Above &amp; Beyond Education &amp; Care centre is located in the suburb of Gate Pa in Tauranga. It is a privately owned centre which caters for children up to five years of age. The current roll is 61 children with 24 identifying as M&#257;ori. The centre employs 100% qualified staff and provides a specific four-year-old programme designed to prepare children for school. The philosophy of the centre is to provide an &lsquo;atmosphere of love and well being in a safe and secure environment&rsquo;.</p><p>The leadership team is developing an arts based curriculum, which provides opportunities for children to explore aspects of the performing and visual arts within an aesthetically pleasing home-like environment. The centre is continuing this development to include science, technology, English and mathematics to complement Arts Based learning.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the centre has:</p><ul>
<li>extended the outside area for the older children and toddlers</li>
<li>changed from two areas to three: babies, toddlers and older children</li>
<li>renovated the entrance area and employed a full time administrator</li>
<li>established a relationship with a kindergarten in Fiji.</li>
</ul><p>The centre responded positively to the 2010 ERO report by continuing to develop opportunities for parent participation in their children&rsquo;s learning and increasing the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori within the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner/manager is an experienced and knowledgeable professional leader. She has established a collaborative approach to centre operations and provides leadership opportunities within a supportive team culture. Along with team leaders the owner/manager has set a specific strategic direction and created a shared vision for innovation, particularly in relation to curriculum, environment and the use of computer technologies.</p><p>Plans and policies are regularly reviewed by reflective leaders and teachers. The centre manager recognises the need to develop a framework for formal self review based on continuous improvement in outcomes for children. There is an effective and rigorous appraisal process linked to relevant professional development and continual monitoring of teachers&rsquo; goals.</p><p>Teachers recognise children&rsquo;s emerging interests and plan programmes to extend children&rsquo;s learning. Evaluation of programmes identifies strengths and possible next steps for teachers and children. Assessment practices are well established. Records of children&rsquo;s progress and participation are digitally recorded and immediately available for parents to access. Each child has an e-portfolio which can be accessed in the playrooms by children. Computer technology is used extensively for programme planning, assessment, evaluation and other documentation. Centre leaders acknowledge that they are continuing to refine assessment and planning processes to make the programme more visible for parents.</p><p>High-quality interactions and positive relationships are features of the centre. Teachers continually engage children in discussions and questioning that strengthen oral language skills. Nursery staff provide infants with warmth, nurture and respect.</p><p>Children throughout the centre play and learn in a calm, settled environment that provides easy access to age-appropriate resources and equipment. The newly designed outdoor area challenges and extends children&rsquo;s creativity and exploration.</p><p>Management and ERO agree that:</p><ul>
<li>the indoor environments could be further enriched by placing displays at children&rsquo;s level and including meaningful bicultural perspectives</li>
<li>increased children&rsquo;s involvement in the four-year-old programme is likely to enhance children&rsquo;s independence and engagement</li>
<li>there is a need to action the plan to adequately ventilate the toddlers sleep room.</li>
</ul><p>Management and staff have effective systems in place to promote an emotionally and physically safe environment for children and adults.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Above &amp; Beyond Education &amp; Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>28 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
