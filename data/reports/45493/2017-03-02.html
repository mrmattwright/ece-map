</table><p>Rollykids Early Learning Centre is part of the Evolve Education Group. The privately-owned company purchased the centre in December 2014. Evolve provides the policy and administration framework.</p><p>The centre is in the early stages of developing effective management and leadership practices. The managers and teachers have participated in extensive professional development funded by Evolve. This has included emphasis on internal evaluation, individual child assessment, programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>The managers have yet to put in place consistent practices that promote high quality learning and teaching for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>There have been significant changes in ownership, leadership and staff in the last three years. Most of the new teaching team are qualified early childhood teachers. A small number of staff are in training to become qualified teachers. There is a regional business manager whose role is to provide professional support and guidance to the centre manager and staff.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children to school age in four separate rooms. Families from an increasingly diverse range of cultures attend the centre.</p><p>This is the centre’s first education review under the governance and management of the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed to the centre. Transitions into and within the centre are flexible and based on the needs of each child and family. Teachers place an emphasis on fostering children's sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Children experience positive, respectful relationships with each other and their teachers. They are settled and focused on their chosen activities and have a range of opportunities to explore the well-resourced indoor and outside areas.</p><p>Teachers support one another in the learning programmes. They provide a wide variety of activities including literacy and mathematics learning and physical play.</p><p>Teachers regularly seek and use parent aspirations for their children as part of the assessment and planning processes. They provide parents with clearly written learning stories which focus on their child's learning and development. Team leaders and teachers are continuing to develop a consistent approach, across all rooms, to planning the learning programme.</p><p>Children under-two-years' experience nurturing, calm and unhurried interactions and routines with adults who are well known to them. Teachers provide many opportunities for infants and toddlers to move freely and explore their environment. They promote children's social and physical development, and increasing independence skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have reviewed the centre philosophy and developed learning priorities for children. They have carefully considered what these priorities look like in their own practice. Leaders and teachers are developing a shared vision for the centre.</p><p>Teachers work well together to complete spontaneous reviews of the environment and their practices. In-depth evaluation is at the early stage of being used in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps to sustain and improve the operation of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing professional support and appraisal for the business manager and centre manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan and annual action plans to identify and address centre priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build leadership and teacher capability in internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing shared understandings of bicultural concepts and incorporating these in key documentation and centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding the new assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rollykids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to relating to appraisal and excursions. ERO has asked the service to consult with the Ministry of Education about the appropriate ratios for regular excursions. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing a system of regular appraisal for all staff including the regional business manager and centre manager (GMA7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that adult to child ratios for regular excursions are consistent and adhered to (HS17).</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7 and HS17</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rollykids Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p> Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer- Te Waipounamu/Southern</p><p>2 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
