</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaitake Kindergarten is one of sixteen kindergartens managed by the North Taranaki Kindergarten Association (the association). The association governing board is responsible for setting overall strategic and policy direction for the organisation. Senior teachers are employed by the association to support teaching and learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is located in the coastal town of Oakura, near New Plymouth. The service is licensed for 34 children aged from two to five years. An experienced head teacher leads the teaching team of four qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy acknowledges that children learn through play within a nurturing environment. Parents are valued as a vital part of the learning process. Their opinions and aspirations are valued, actively sought and used as a basis for future decisions.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. Areas for review and development from the August 2010 ERO report have been considered and responded to effectively.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the North Taranaki Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Board members undertake regular training and have developed useful processes to support governance roles and responsibilities. The senior teacher provides ongoing support and guidance for teachers. She promotes regular professional development opportunities and use of systems that focus on fostering positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Respectful and sensitive interactions between children and teachers are evident. There is a welcoming atmosphere and purposeful, cooperative play is a feature. A carefully considered and well resourced setting contributes significantly to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Children learn about the natural world and sustainable practices in the interesting and stimulating environment. They actively contribute to caring for their environment.</p><p>Teachers value the importance of relationships as a significant part of effective teaching and learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed. Support for children with additional needs is highly inclusive. Teachers promote independent learning and offer children a variety of opportunities to self-select inviting activities. At times ERO observed children encouraged to develop in-depth problem solving and being authentically empowered to be part of their own learning.</p><p>Teachers work well together, share ideas and support each other. They value each other&rsquo;s strengths. Regular consultation with parents encourages their contribution in decision-making processes to enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers effectively support children to settle into kindergarten. Transition to and from the kindergarten is flexible and responsive to the needs and preferences of children and families. Positive, reciprocal relationships with the school help to support children and families with the move to school.</p><p>The environment reflects the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Children have opportunities to hear te reo M&#257;ori in the programme. Teachers are making good use of self review to build on and extend their practice in giving significance to M&#257;ori learners&rsquo; culture, language, and identity</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning. Appropriate next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to embed understanding and use of self review to critically inquire into their teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes to more effectively highlight children&rsquo;s progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leading curriculum-based, capable early childhood learner conversations with teachers at schools to enhance children&rsquo;s transitions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to review appraisal and consider formal critique of teaching practice and feedback processes to improve teaching and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaitake Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaitake Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>9 October 2013<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
