</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Pharazyn Street operates under the Best Start Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood education services across New Zealand.</p><p>The purpose built centre is located near the Lower Hutt central business district. It provides education and care for 52 children including 15 up to two years of age. Eight Māori and three pacific children are enrolled. A manager has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre. Changes in the leadership team have resulted from internal promotions.</p><p>ERO’s January 2013 report identified areas of practice requiring further development. These included appraisal, self review, and the integration of bicultural perspectives in the review process. Sufficient progress in these areas is evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four in the BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are purposefully engaged in a rich learning environment that encourages their investigation, problem solving and thinking. Teachers use a range of strategies to effectively extend learning. Children's independence is promoted throughout the programme. Wellbeing is strongly supported through the centre-wide focus on healthy eating and promotion of physical activity.</p><p>Warm and consistent caregiving sensitively responds to infants' and toddlers' changing needs and preferences. There is a calm, slow pace to the day which allows them space and time to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children are involved in developing the project-based curriculum which is responsive to their interests. This approach is also used effectively by teachers to add complexity and challenge to learning. Recent positive initiatives to increase parent involvement in their child's education include gathering whānau aspirations and inviting them to programme planning meetings. Programme evaluation should be strengthened through including a focus on how well teachers' practice has supported intended outcomes.</p><p>Regular entries in children's profile books provide a rich narrative of their engagement in the programme and increasing subject knowledge. A next step is to revisit the BestStart planning and curriculum guidelines to develop teachers' shared understanding of assessment for learning.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are effectively integrated throughout the programme. Children are familiar with the use of te reo Māori and respond appropriately. Leaders and teachers have identified the following next steps:  </p><ul>
<li>exploring how a place-based curriculum could enhance their bicultural programme</li>
<li>revisiting key Ministry of Education publications such as <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, <em>Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013-2017 </em>to support them to more strategically engage with whānau Māori.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are aware they need to further develop their understanding of Pacific languages, cultures and identities, which should strengthen their work with their Pacific families and communities.</p><p>Self review is effectively guided by the BestStart guidelines. The process is collaborative and used well by leaders and teachers to support ongoing improvement. This approach should be strengthened by building their understanding of internal evaluation and in-depth analysis of the data gathered.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes a self and appraiser assessment and has a development focus. Leaders have identified that a next step is to include formal observations of practice for teachers renewing their practising certificates. ERO agrees with this direction. BestStart provides opportunities for teachers to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>Strong leadership and a demonstrated commitment to the philosophy of the centre are evident.  Leaders have a clear focus on teaching and learning that contributes to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>BestStart, as a governing body, regularly undertakes parent satisfaction surveys which are used to further develop practice. Most parents involved in these surveys indicate a high degree of satisfaction with teacher practice and the curriculum provided.</p><p>Professional service managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. They clearly identify strengths and areas for improvement through this process.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework including procedures and systems, guide the operation of the centre. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>the bicultural curriculum through developing leaders' and teachers' knowledge and use of place‑based education</li>
<li>teachers' knowledge of educational success for Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>understanding and implementation of effective internal evaluation</li>
<li>appraisal, through including observations of teachers' practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Pharazyn Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Pharazyn Street will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>2 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
