<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the K&#257;ramuramu Kindergarten governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the January 2013 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>professional leadership and day-to-day management</li>
<li>implementation of the curriculum and teachers responsiveness to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths</li>
<li>self-review practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>K&#257;ramuramu Kindergarten is located in Murupara and caters for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is governed by the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association. It operates Monday to Friday from 8.45am to 3.45pm. The roll consists of children from the Murupara and Galatea districts. Many families/wh&#257;nau have had long standing generational connections with the kindergarten. New families are made to feel welcome.</p><p>At the request of the community, and as a result of wh&#257;nau consultation the kindergarten was re- established by the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association in May 2011. Previously known as Murupara Kindergarten, the kindergarten was renamed Karamuramu.</p><p>The ERO report in January 2013 identified that while the kindergarten was well placed to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, it was not well placed to promote children&rsquo;s learning. This was due to improvements needed to strengthen kindergarten operations, professional leadership, the emergent curriculum and self-review practices.</p><p>Since the last ERO review a new head teacher has been appointed. She has worked collaboratively with teachers and together they have made significant progress in addressing the terms of reference identified in this report. K&#257;ramuramu Kindergarten is now well placed to promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Effective leadership from both the new head teacher and senior teacher from the association has resulted in the development of a cohesive teaching team. Teachers have reviewed the kindergarten&rsquo;s mission and vision statement. They have developed a shared understanding and together created an environment that empowers the community of learners to realise their potential. The vision is enacted through the support provided to assist children to become imaginative, creative and connected lifelong learners.</p><p>Improvements to leadership, curriculum delivery and self review can be attributed to the professional leadership provided by the new head teacher. She has worked alongside teachers and established a reflective and professional team culture focused on promoting positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed programme planning and deepened their understanding of the emergent curriculum, and possible ways of responding and extending children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers have now effectively adapted their practices to meet the specific needs and interests of children.</p><p>The association has provided the head teacher and the teaching team with effective ongoing professional support and encouragement to assist in ongoing improvements. Teachers have participated in focused professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers have made significant progress in strengthening the kindergartens curriculum. Areas of progress include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers recognising children&rsquo;s interests, and planning experiences to further extend their learning</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children to revisit, reflect and plan for their own learning</li>
<li>providing rich opportunities for children to problem solve, take informed risks, and overcome challenges through persistence, particularly in their physical and outdoor play</li>
<li>developing a programme that is inclusive and enables all children to participate and enjoy learning in a positive social context.</li>
</ul><p>A highlight for children, teachers and wh&#257;nau has been the improvements to the outdoor play area. Teachers with the support of wh&#257;nau/families have created a natural and exciting environment for children to pursue their interests and actively explore. This achievement has been recognised through winning the Whakatane District Preschool Garden of the Year award.</p><p>The head teacher has effectively led the development and implementation of useful self review practices. These practices assist teachers to better evaluate the quality of education and care. Teachers are now confidently using evidence based research and inquiry approaches within their self-review practices. This informed and robust approach to self review should better enable teachers to develop and improve kindergarten operations.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Through regular self review teachers have identified some areas for further development. These areas include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening teacher capability, knowledge and understanding of local iwi history, legends and stories and tikanga M&#257;ori practices in the programme</li>
<li>developing a strategic and annual plan in consultation with the wh&#257;nau and community</li>
<li>strengthening processes for engaging with the wh&#257;nau and community</li>
<li>developing processes and strategies for researching and implementing a nature-based approach to education, where children learn in the local forest and bush.</li>
</ul><p>Working collaboratively to address these areas for development should ensure the kindergarten remains focused on continued improvement.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 December 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
