</table><p>Kaikorai Kindergarten¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaikorai Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged two years to school age. It is licensed for 40 children. There are 43 children currently enrolled, nine of whom are MƒÅori. Sessions operate from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>Teachers aim to support children's developing capabilities for social and emotional competence, communication, sustainability and building positive relationships. They plan to promote these outcomes through building reciprocal relationships with children and families, a focus on children's holistic development; provision of a curriculum that gives emphasis to sustainability and biculturalism and supporting children to have choice and take risks in their learning.</p><p>Positive progress has been made in addressing the areas identified for improvement in the kindergarten's October 2015 report, in particular, strengthening internal evaluation for improvement.</p><p>Kaikorai Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). Day-to-day operations are led by a head teacher with the support of three qualified teachers. A senior teacher from DK provides support for professional and operational practice. At the time of this review a new head teacher had been very recently appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven DK kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to develop the kindergarten's intended learning outcomes through purposeful teaching and learning programmes. Children experience caring, responsive and purposeful interactions with teachers. These effectively foster and support children's ability to play positively with and alongside one another and sustain their engagement in play. Older children have weekly opportunities to explore and learn about the natural world through regular excursions to a local 'forest'. All children hear, learn about and participate in <span lang="mi">te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori</span>.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging and wellbeing is sensitively fostered in partnership with families and whƒÅnau. Teachers build highly respectful, reciprocal relationships with parents and whƒÅnau in order to learn about children's interests, preferences and learning dispositions. Teachers welcome and encourage parents' and whƒÅnau contribution to the learning programme. They pay special attention to children and their families' cultural values, practices and languages, and include and celebrate these in the environment and programme. Teachers are mindful of the different needs of younger children and children with additional needs and use a range of inclusive practices to promote equitable learning outcomes for these children.</p><p>Assessment and planning respond well to individual children's interests and learning dispositions and parent and whƒÅnau aspirations. Assessment of children's learning shows teachers use a range of intentional teaching strategies to promote and extend children's progress toward individualised goals. Teachers could make better use of the goals and learning outcomes from the early childhood curriculum, <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em> and the kindergarten's new curriculum priorities to support planning, assessment and evaluation for groups and individuals.</p><p>Teachers use professional inquiries and evaluations effectively to improve teaching practices and outcomes for children and their families. Internal evaluation is collaborative, well focused on what makes a difference for children's learning, and evidence-based. Next steps are to ensure there is forward planning for evaluation and that it is aligned with the kindergarten's reviewed philosophy, curriculum priorities and strategic goals.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2016 reviews. DK's mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. DK has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to continue to improve processes and practices for assessment and planning. This should include ensuring they reflect the kindergarten's new curriculum priorities and make better use of the goals and learning outcomes from <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki.</span></em> Quality assurance processes need to be further developed to better support consistent, high quality practice.</p><p>Leaders need to develop a long-term plan for ongoing evaluations which are well aligned with strategic goals, the kindergarten's philosophy and curriculum priorities.</p><p>The DK board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the DK‚Äôs and kindergartens‚Äô priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaikorai Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>22 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
