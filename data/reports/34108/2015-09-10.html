</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Happy Little Learners, previously known as Kids Time Hillcrest, is a privately owned centre that provides a full-day education and care service for children from approximately six months to school age. It is located in Hamilton in a converted home that has a spacious garden area at the rear. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 23 children including up to 10 aged under two. The current roll is 19 children, of whom 5 are identified as MƒÅori. Children of all ages play and socialise together in a family-like environment.</p><p>The ownership of the centre has changed twice since the 2012 ERO review. The current owner is based in Auckland and retains responsibility for employment, property and financial management, strategic planning, and compliance with legislative requirements. Permanently employed teachers have been retained, and a high proportion are fully registered teachers. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of the on-site supervisor who held the same position with the previous owners.</p><p>The current philosophy was developed under the previous owners, and the new owners are currently reviewing overall purpose statements, values and strategic direction. The centre responded very positively to recommendations in the 2012 Supplementary ERO report. Staff were involved in professional development related to self review and assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience caring, affirming and respectful relationships with adults who know them and their families well. Older children are encouraged and expected to be supportive and considerate towards younger children in this mixed-age centre. Routines such as mat and meal times are shared opportunities, which reinforce social skills and build children‚Äôs sense of belonging and wellbeing. Some permanent staff make a particular effort to use te reo MƒÅori for greetings, instructions, waiata and karakia. Leaders recognise that strengthening the centre‚Äôs bicultural perspective in the programme and operations continues to be an area for improvement and consolidation.</p><p>Babies and toddlers have safe and calm areas to explore their environment. They are able to participate in the overall programme offered by the centre. Teachers maintain close communication with the parents of the youngest children to promote continuity and support between home and the centre.</p><p>The inside play areas provide opportunities for early literacy and numeracy skills to develop. Creative and imaginative play is encouraged. Teachers, particularly the permanent staff, successfully engage children in learning conversations, which build oral language skills and help children to build their understanding of the world round them. Children and their families are supported as they transition to school.</p><p>Children have the opportunity for some appropriate physical challenge and exploration in an outside environment that is extensive and includes mature trees. Currently, children are largely reliant on teachers to access equipment to develop or extend their play. Increasing children‚Äôs ongoing access to high quality equipment and resources, in both the indoor and outside environments, is likely to encourage sustained child-initiated learning through play.</p><p>Teachers have a focussed responsibility for a group of about 6 or 7 children. Each month teachers prepare a planning chart that summarises the developing interests and strengths that have been observed in their group of children. Teacher planning recognises the learning that is occurring, and considers how they can respond to extend children‚Äôs understanding and engagement. In addition, teachers complete a summary to evaluate the previous month‚Äôs programme for their children.</p><p>Teachers prepare well-presented, illustrated portfolios to show learning and development for children. These portfolios are shared with parents and whƒÅnau each month, and their input and contribution is actively encouraged. It is important that teachers continue to strengthen the reflection of each child‚Äôs identity, language and heritage in their portfolio.</p><p>The previous owners were present on-site for part of each week until they sold the service in early July 2015. They supported the supervisor to work closely with staff to build several aspects of good professional practice. The supervisor has responsibility for performance management of staff and provides feedback from observations of practice. She encourages staff to reflect on their practice through on-line journals.</p><p>Externally facilitated professional learning has resulted in effective planning, assessment and evaluation processes being put in place. Self review is robust and has a sustained focus on centre improvement. Recent areas of self review have included social competence of children, and the inside play spaces. Self review should now be extended to identify the areas of the curriculum and programme that are in need of further development.</p><p>Despite the changes of ownership, staff have made a conscious effort to maintain close relationships and effective communication with parents and whƒÅnau. It is timely for parents and whƒÅnau to be consulted on the overall direction of the centre, as new owners establish their presence.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the current owner and supervisor agree that the important next step is to consult with staff, parents and whƒÅnau in the review of the centre‚Äôs philosophy, mission and values. This process is likely to lead to shared and agreed understandings on:</p><ul>
<li>how effective learning is embedded in meaningful play</li>
<li>the most appropriate balance between child-initiated and teacher-led aspects of the programme</li>
<li>how to realise the potential of the environment to build confident and competent learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Happy Little Learners completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Happy Little Learners will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
