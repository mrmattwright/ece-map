</table><p>Centre leaders and teachers need further external support to build leadership capacity and coherent management systems that support teachers to improve the curriculum and promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Family Link Childcare in Dargaville, Northland is a community- based, not-for-profit service governed and owned by an incorporated society. It is licensed for 50 children, including up to 20 children under the age of two years. Families have a choice of their children attending for the full day or sessions. The roll fluctuates as a result of families' seasonal working conditions.</p><p>The long-serving centre supervisor oversees operational and management aspects and reports to the governance board. There are nine staff members including the supervisor and the administration support person. The two senior teachers lead their teams in the management and implementation of the curriculum.</p><p>The purpose-built centre is divided into two separate indoors and outdoors areas for infants and toddlers, and older children. Children can move freely between these spaces.</p><p>ERO's 2009 and 2013 reports recommended that management and governance practices be improved as well as some programme management systems and the centre environment. Although some progress has been made, further work is required to fully address the recommendations.</p><p>The programme provided for children is based on <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whƒÅnau experience respectful relationships with kind and caring teachers. Children quickly settle into the programme and into the welcoming environment. Mixed-age play opportunities are valued and promoted. Children are confident and show a high level of enjoyment in their play. There is an unhurried pace to the programme. Strengthening the provision for children up to two years of age, including recognising their physical need for movement and focusing more on the individual child are necessary next steps.</p><p>Teachers skilfully settle and work alongside children, following their play experiences. Children would, however, benefit from more opportunities for creative and imaginative play, and access to a wider range of resources that offer more variety and challenges.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively to extend children's interests and evaluate the programme in meetings held termly. The programme is planned through a theme-based format to be implemented in the new term. Teachers and centre leaders should review how well meeting every three months enables them to deliver positive outcomes for children. They should focus on the impact that their teaching strategies are having on the quality of the learning as they develop planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Staff have been involved in a self-review workshop and have developed an appropriate format that they can use to bring about improvement in children's learning. They should strengthen self-review practices across all aspects of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The supervisor and teachers should access external expertise to develop effective teaching and learning practices that extend children's thinking and support them to engage in deeper learning and more complex play. In particular they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' planning, assessment and evaluation to identify and extend individual children's interests, learning and progress overtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the daily programme and make children's cultural heritage more visible in their portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a wide range of easily accessible resources for children up to two years, to encourage exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement robust self review to clearly identify next steps for the centre to guide ongoing and sustainable improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders recognise external professional development, advice and support are also needed to improve areas of governance and leadership. Next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>renewing and developing the centre philosophy, vision and values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying the roles and responsibilities of staff members, centre leaders and the governance board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly evaluating the progress towards long-term centre goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre's long-term and annual plans</p>
</li>
</ul><p>improving the teacher appraisal process, including setting goals that further extend teachers' professional practice and knowledge in meeting the <em>Practising Teachers Criteria</em>.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Family Link Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the quality of curriculum, governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide a range of quality resources, experiences and opportunities to enhance and extend children's learning and development both indoors and outdoors in a group and individually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>report to the preschool community about the expenditure of Equity Funding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement suitable human resource practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an ongoing process of self review to help the service maintain and improve the quality of education and care.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6,7 and C9; Early Childhood Funding Handbook, Ch10.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Family Link Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
