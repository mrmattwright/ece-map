<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Home Grown Kids (40275) operates under the ownership and management of Home Grown Kids, Childcare from Home, a privately owned homebased care and nanny service. The network operates on the North Shore, Waiheke Island and in West Auckland. It provides education and care for children from birth to school age either in educators&rsquo; homes or with nannies in children&rsquo;s own homes. A feature of the service is the culture of respect where open and reciprocal relationships are evident at all levels.</p><p>The coordinator, who is a qualified, experienced and highly skilled early childhood teacher, provides effective overview, support and encouragement for nannies and educators in the network. Educators and nannies are caring and demonstrate genuine affection for children. They compile valued learning journals that record rich experiences and learning for individual children. The journals are regularly shared with families and children. Some parents confidently contribute their ideas and aspirations to strengthen the assessment process for their own child. Finding ways to involve and inform more parents is likely to assist them to become confident partners in their children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>Children enjoy participating in an extensive range of meaningful learning experiences. There are many opportunities to make links with the wider community and participate in organised outings and playgroups. Priority is also given to fostering children&rsquo;s interests and promoting their emotional well-being and safety in group situations and loving home environments. Strengthening opportunities for children to experience the M&#257;ori language and culture would support their growing appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p>The service has an effective and up-to-date website that enables quality communication and consultation with parents and prospective clients. Reflective practice and planned self review assists management and coordinators to monitor their effectiveness and make progressive improvements to the quality of education and services provided to families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Home Grown Kids (40275) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atHome Grown Kids (40275).</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Home Grown Kids, 40275, was previously located in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty region. The network now operates on the North Shore, Waiheke Island and in West Auckland. The service philosophy emphasises the importance of providing opportunities for children to learn through play. Adults aim to encourage children to take risks within safe limits and to provide a wide range of community experiences and social interactions. For this evaluation, review officers attended an organised community excursion and visited two educators&rsquo; homes where education and care is provided for up to four children at any one time. Observations were made of interactions among children, their educators, the service coordinators, other children and adults. In addition, parents using the service and educators were invited to contribute their perspective of the service through a questionnaire, and the care arranger, coordinator and regional manager were interviewed.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Professional leadership: The network coordinator is an experienced and highly skilled early childhood education practitioner and role model. She is reflective and able to provide perceptive feedback, suggestions and professional readings to educators that have the potential to extend children&rsquo;s learning. The coordinator is a valued member of the wider Home Grown Kids team where there is an embedded culture of collaborative teamwork and professionalism.</p><p>Relationships: Respectful and reciprocal relationships at all levels are a feature of the service. Educators are caring and demonstrate genuine affection and in depth knowledge of children. They implement meaningful and regular communication with families that assists them to respond to children&rsquo;s interests and personal routines. Educators feel valued and well supported by service personnel who are approachable and provide quality support, resourcing and professional development opportunities.</p><p>Assessment practice: Learning journals for individual children are valued records of children&rsquo;s rich experiences and learning. These records include a range of perspectives about children&rsquo;s interests, learning and developing social relationships. The journals are regularly shared with families and children, with some parents confidently contributing to the assessment process.</p><p>Self review: Management and coordinators have a well developed understanding of self review as a means to monitor service effectiveness and inform ongoing improvement. Reflective practice is a strong feature of both formal and informal self-review practices. In addition, the service has an effective and up-to-date website that is integral to quality communication and consultation with its stakeholders.</p><p>Learning opportunities: Children benefit from an extensive range of authentic learning opportunities. They enjoy many situations to makemeaningful links with the wider community which is an integral part of the Home Grown Kids service. Educators&rsquo; homes are thoughtfully presented to engage children and motivate their curiosity. Priority is also given to fostering children&rsquo;s interests, growing social competence and emotional well-being in loving family environments.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Educational partnership: The service has identified the need to further develop parent input and involvement. Continuing to seek ways of involving parents and enhancing their understanding of the valuable learning that comes from play, exploration and social interactions is a priority for the service. Strengthening opportunities for parent input is likely to empower them as partners in their children&rsquo;s learning journey.</p><p>M&#257;ori dimension: The service is yet to develop curriculum aspirations and practices that reflect the unique place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. Strengthening opportunities for all children to develop knowledge and understanding of the M&#257;ori language and culture would support and encourage their appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Promoting Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Competence</h3><p>As children learn to make sense of their world they develop an understanding of themselves in social contexts, including the early childhood service. As part of this review ERO looked at how each service&rsquo;s curriculum supports children&rsquo;s developing social and emotional competence.</p><p>The findings are reported in the Quality of Education section of this report and used as part of a national evaluation report on this topic.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Home Grown Kids (40275) completed an ERO Home-Based Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><p>15 November 2010</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-home-grown-kids-40275" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Home Grown Kids (40275)</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Home Grown Kids (40275).</p><p>Home Grown Kids (40275) operates under the ownership and management of Home Grown Kids, Childcare from Home, a privately owned homebased care and nanny service. The network operates on the North Shore, Waiheke Island and in West Auckland. It provides education and care for children from birth to school age either in educators&rsquo; homes or with nannies in children&rsquo;s own homes. A feature of the service is the culture of respect where open and reciprocal relationships are evident at all levels.</p><p>The coordinator, who is a qualified, experienced and highly skilled early childhood teacher, provides effective overview, support and encouragement for nannies and educators in the network. Educators and nannies are caring and demonstrate genuine affection for children. They compile valued learning journals that record rich experiences and learning for individual children. The journals are regularly shared with families and children. Some parents confidently contribute their ideas and aspirations to strengthen the assessment process for their own child. Finding ways to involve and inform more parents is likely to assist them to become confident partners in their children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>Children enjoy participating in an extensive range of meaningful learning experiences. There are many opportunities to make links with the wider community and participate in organised outings and playgroups. Priority is also given to fostering children&rsquo;s interests and promoting their emotional well-being and safety in group situations and loving home environments. Strengthening opportunities for children to experience the M&#257;ori language and culture would support their growing appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p>The service has an effective and up-to-date website that enables quality communication and consultation with parents and prospective clients. Reflective practice and planned self review assists management and coordinators to monitor their effectiveness and make progressive improvements to the quality of education and services provided to families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
