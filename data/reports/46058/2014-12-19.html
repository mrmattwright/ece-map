</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Karikari Educare is a new centre located on the Karikari Peninsula, Kaitaia. It opened in December 2012 and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. Children and families using the centre come mostly from Karikari and surrounding areas. Most children attending the centre identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre was established to meet the needs of the local community, especially MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau. Special events like hangi are held to build relationships with families, and parents frequently remain at the centre observing and learning alongside their child and teachers. Centre leaders are aware that the amount of available space and learning opportunities for older children are currently limited, while a new outdoor area and buildings are being completed.</p><p>A new lead teacher has recently been appointed following some earlier leadership changes. The centre employs six registered teachers and eight of the 12 staff members identify as MƒÅori and speak te reo. Centre owners are committed to its success and have a vision to improve educational outcomes for local tamariki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know children and their whƒÅnau well. A number of families have more than one child attending and this strengthens relationships with the centre. Teachers provide an inclusive environment and children demonstrate that they care for each other, greeting other children as they arrive. WhƒÅnau are encouraged to participate in the centre and parents acknowledge the positive difference the centre is making to their families. Teachers interact and respond to children, supporting them in their play. An increased focus by teachers on the use of strategies to extend children‚Äôs communication skills would be beneficial.</p><p>Further work on curriculum development is also needed as centre programmes are not yet sufficiently developed to meet the learning and social needs of older children. Resourcing in the centre is also in the initial stages, limiting children‚Äôs choice of resources. It would be an advantage for the over two group to have greater access to high quality equipment that is likely to promote complex and challenging learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers working with children under two provide a caring environment. Toddlers in this area would benefit from greater access to outdoor play beyond the deck area. Transitioning of children to the over two area has recently been reviewed and transitioning strategies have been clarified.</p><p>Considerable work has been done in planning the curriculum. These plans however, have not yet resulted in meaningful programmes for children. Teachers would benefit from a more comprehensive level of guidance and training to help them plan and implement effective programmes for children. The centre owner and lead teacher recognise the importance of appropriate curriculum planning and are beginning to work alongside teachers to improve their practice. Self review is not yet resulting in the necessary improvements to curriculum planning.</p><p>Children‚Äôs progress and development is documented in portfolios and described through children‚Äôs learning stories. Parents and children value these portfolios. A wall display identifies children‚Äôs individual interests and is used well to prompt teachers‚Äô guidance of children. This is helpful in providing meaningful learning challenges for children.</p><p>The lead teacher and centre owners have a shared vision for the centre. However, this vision is yet to be fully understood by staff and embedded in centre programmes and practices. Leaders agree that establishing a code of conduct with the staff would help to unify the team and raise the standards of professional practice centre wide.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The lead teacher has identified next steps for the centre. These include professional development for teachers and increasing opportunities for teachers to work and learn together to improve teaching practice as priorities for the centre.</p><p>The owners and lead teacher agree that it is important to consolidate centre leadership. Centre staff need to know what is required of them professionally, including expectations that they participate in high quality professional development. This clarity would enable leaders to work with staff to help define a centre culture, and create clarity around professional expectations for teachers.</p><p>ERO recommends that planning for centre development includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a clearly defined strategic plan with measurable goals aligned to annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expanding the centre‚Äôs philosophy to include educational outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working with staff to establish a staff code of conduct with clear expectations for teachers‚Äô professional practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing effective planning, assessment and evaluation practices that support teachers to develop high quality teaching programmes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of te reo MƒÅori throughout the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karikari Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified two areas of non-compliance relating to programme management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>planning, implementing and evaluating a curriculum that is designed to enhance children‚Äôs learning and development</li>
<li>managing children‚Äôs behaviour in a way that promotes positive outcomes for children.<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, No.43 (1a).</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Karikari Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
