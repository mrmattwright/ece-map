</table><p>PORSE Canterbury S2¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Canterbury S2 is a standard, home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd (the organisation). It is one of three networks in Canterbury. There are 20 children currently enrolled in the network.</p><p>Since the February 2015 ERO review the organisation has had two changes of ownership. In 2015 it was sold to Evolve Education Group Ltd. In late 2018, it was purchased by Rainbow Group. The existing structures for national and community team management have continued. The role of curriculum and quality assurance coach has recently been created to support the work of the national coach.</p><p>In this network, four programme tutors, who are qualified and registered teachers, work alongside untrained educators to assist them to implement care and learning programmes for children in the homes. Programme tutors are supported by a regional coach who reports to the senior leadership team. A recent restructure of staffing has resulted in changes to the programme tutor role.</p><p>Two options for education and care are offered: the home educator model, where the educator works in their own home; and the nanny educator model, where an educator works in a family‚Äôs home.</p><p>The organisation's vision is ‚Äòexpanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home‚Äô. The philosophy guiding teaching and learning has been refreshed to better acknowledge PORSE‚Äôs commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. There is an emphasis on authentic relationships, environments and learning experiences.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified that improvement was required in the curriculum planning, including MƒÅori perspectives and internal evaluation. Good progress has been made in all areas, however aspects of each remain as next steps for improvement.</p><p>This review was one of six in the PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Establishing strong, warm and responsive relationships with children, families and whƒÅnau is highly valued and promoted within the organisation. Leaders and programme tutors carefully select and match the educator, parent and family to foster parents' choice and provide children with consistent care and education. This supports children and families to develop a sense of belonging to the educator.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of activities and experiences that respond to their interests and abilities. PORSE-organised playschools and excursions provide children with opportunities to develop social and physical skills, connections with the community and extend the in-home curriculum.</p><p>Programme tutors are in the early stages of implementing Treaty of Waitangi based practices. The regional coach has identified that building these practices into programmes and practices is a priority.</p><p>Programme tutors work positively alongside educators to provide nurturing environments for infants' and toddlers' wellbeing and learning. This includes supporting educators to be responsive to young children by establishing continuity and consistency with care routines. Children with additional learning needs benefit from the low child-to-adult ratios.</p><p>Educators are well supported to provide education and care for children through useful systems and processes, trained personnel, resources and ongoing training. They receive regular visits and communication with programme tutors who have oversight that expectations and compliance matters are met. Some streamlining and refinement to policies and processes is needed to ensure that practices are consistently implemented, in particular, the risk management assessment for excursions.</p><p>Planning and assessment for children's learning is variable across the network. Educators regularly record day-to-day activities and children's involvement in the programme. It is timely to undertake further work to identify priorities for children's learning aligned to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and to strengthen key aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>An appropriate appraisal process encourages professional growth.</p><p>The PORSE organisation values self review as a tool to promote improvement. Coaches and programme tutors regularly carry out reviews. When the philosophy is next reviewed, it should be influenced by the aspirations parents, families and whƒÅnau have for their children.</p><p>Leaders and programme tutors should continue to develop their understanding and use of robust internal evaluation for improvement through building evaluative thinking and reasoning capability at all levels of the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for PORSE leaders are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build Treaty of Waitangi based practice in systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to develop curriculum priorities and desired outcomes for children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revise the service philosophy, ensuring that it is influenced by the aspirations parents, families and whƒÅnau have for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop evaluative thinking and reasoning capability to effectively use internal evaluation throughout all systems and processes to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The key next step for network leaders and programme tutors is to develop effective planning and assessment processes and practices that support educators to show how:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the curriculum reflects identified priorities for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents‚Äò aspirations for their children‚Äôs learning are responded to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are valued</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they identify children‚Äôs capabilities and where additional support may be needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children‚Äôs next steps for learning lead to progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and programme tutors need to work with educators to evaluate the effectiveness of planned strategies and experiences in supporting desired outcomes for learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Canterbury S2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance in health and safety. The service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that documentation shows that whenever children leave the premises on an excursion, assessment and management of risk is undertaken.<br>Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, HS14.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should improve monitoring of health and safety systems in each home, in particular, medication and evacuation procedures.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>8 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
