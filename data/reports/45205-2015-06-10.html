</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Adventureland Early Learning Centre in Ellerslie is privately owned, and provides full day learning programmes. It is licensed for 40 children, including 10 aged under two years. Children attending the centre are predominately NZ European/P&#257;keh&#257;, Chinese and Middle Eastern, with increasing numbers of children from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The learning environment has separate indoor and outdoor areas for babies and children aged less than two years, and for children aged from two years to school age.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on creating an environment where children learn through play, adventure and exploration in a homely environment. Links to the early childhood curriculum,<em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, are identified along with the team&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse community.</p><p>A team of eight full-time teachers and 3 part-time teachers provides good staff to child ratios. The 2012 ERO report noted the caring interactions between teachers and children, and the programme&rsquo;s responsiveness to children&rsquo;s interests. The licensee has responded well to the report&rsquo;s identified next steps, by strengthening self review and by working with external advisers to guide developments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their wh&#257;nau are welcomed into the well equipped centre. Children settle quickly, play well alongside each other and enthusiastically join in group learning activities. The unhurried programme and routines help to foster children&rsquo;s sense of well being and belonging. Children display independence and freely access a wide range of resources. They have many opportunities to make choices about their play.</p><p>Children benefit from the responsive, inclusive child-centred and well-paced programme. Teachers work well together and respond readily to children&rsquo;s learning interests. Literacy and mathematics are integrated in activities and play. Music and movement are features of the programme.</p><p>Children have many opportunities for uninterrupted play so they can sustain their interest in activities. They are encouraged to manage their behaviour, access and put away materials and to look after their own belongings. These are skills that will help children when they transition to school.</p><p>Children aged up to two years benefit from nurturing interactions with their teachers and carers. Teachers are actively engaged with these children and they provide many opportunities for children to learn through play and to explore their environment.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge children&rsquo;s cultures well. Bicultural practices are being further developed through teachers&rsquo; association with a local marae. Bilingual teachers support children and their families whose first language is not English.</p><p>Teachers keep parents well informed about their child&rsquo;s day at the centre and parents express high levels of satisfaction with the centre and the staff. Parents value the multicultural learning environment. They also appreciate the open-plan indoor areas that allow younger children to be connected with older children&rsquo;s activities.</p><p>Programme planning responds well to the interests and strengths of individual children. It also reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Children&rsquo;s individual learning progress is evaluated regularly and is recorded in portfolios and on a web-based communication system.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers regularly review their policies and practices for ongoing centre improvement. Long-term plans guide and sustain future centre developments. The licensee values teachers&rsquo; ongoing capability and provides staff with professional learning opportunities. Recent professional learning on planning and assessment has strengthened teaching and learning practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to explore ways to make children's play more complex to extend their thinking</li>
<li>advancing plans to provide children with further exploration and discovery opportunities in the outdoor area.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Adventureland Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Adventureland Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 June 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
