<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Whangamata Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Whangamata Playcentre is a parent cooperative that operates under the umbrella of Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association. The centre is located next to Whangamata Area School, and has maintained a close relationship with the school. It is licensed to provide three sessions a week for children from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review, the majority of children attending were under three years of age. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is to foster learning through play in a rich, stimulating environment, in which children and adults are empowered to work, learn and grow together.</p><p>Members receive effective association support. This includes valuable administrative and educational leadership provided by a very knowledgeable liaison officer, as well as financial, property and personnel management support. The association has also assisted members to maintain funded sessions despite a short-term drop in playcentre training levels. Ongoing implementation of a plan to increase training levels should assist members to independently meet funding requirements and to increase members&rsquo; collective understanding of best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Members have made substantial progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2010 ERO report. They have significantly improved the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation, self-review practices and the centre&rsquo;s relationship with the association. Members have extended the covered outdoor area and created more open, visible and spacious indoor play areas with improved child access to resources. They have reorganised many areas of play and have provided a safer area for babies and toddlers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful and responsive interactions with a wide variety of adults and peers of different ages. The older children play well together and often initiate cooperative and imaginative play. Toddlers actively explore the environment and learn by playing alongside and observing older peers. Babies respond with enthusiasm and delight when interacting with children and adults. Children are confident communicators and display high levels of trust and belonging at the centre.</p><p>The programme reflects parents&rsquo; understanding of playcentre philosophy and <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Members skilfully foster children&rsquo;s independence and creativity, and the development of language, social and physical skills. They support children&rsquo;s emerging interests by making suggestions and providing additional resources and equipment. Some parents are particularly skilled at encouraging children to problem solve and think for themselves.</p><p>Parents have made effective use of self review to improve the quality of portfolios and collective planning to cater for children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Several portfolios document the development of children&rsquo;s strengths and interests over time. Members could further reflect on the purpose of portfolios, strengthening strategies to support each other to use observations more consistently to identify children&rsquo;s learning, interests, and ways to explore these further.</p><p>Families are very committed to sharing leadership and other responsibilities. They work well as a team and benefit from each other&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and experience. Decision making is enhanced by the liaison officer&rsquo;s identification of issues and professional advice. Members have recently implemented a system of self review. This system places a strong emphasis on extending and improving learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The recent restructuring of the association has had positive outcomes for this centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>increased parent participation in strategic decision making at association level</li>
<li>more responsive support and oversight of financial and property management</li>
<li>members devoting more time to learning and playing with their children, and completing playcentre training.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the liaison officer and centre leaders that the next steps for members are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the integration of te reo M&#257;ori and literacy, mathematical and scientific concepts in the programme and learning environment,</li>
<li>continue to review challenges and opportunities for exploration for children , especially in the outdoor and under two areas</li>
<li>make learning more visible for children</li>
<li>develop action plans for improvement with clear criteria to evaluate their effectiveness in improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Whangamata Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>1 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
