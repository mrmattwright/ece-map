<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>KiNZ Sandringham Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3><b>Context</b></h3><p>The centre is located in Sandringham and caters for up to 40 children over two years of age. It has been open for five years in a purpose-built facility next to a primary school. Children come from the local area and from a diverse range of ethnicities. Families appreciate that the teaching staff reflect the multicultural mix of the community and use their strengths well to support children and families.</p><p>The centre is part of the Kindergarten NZ Limited (KiNZ) Early Learning Centres, which is a subsidiary of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. A sound governance and management base of professional policies, procedures and operating systems is in place. Active support from KiNZ personnel informs and supports ongoing service improvement. A useful performance management process and opportunities for professional learning and development through KiNZ are valued by staff.</p><p>Centre managers have continued to improve programmes and systems since the centre&rsquo;s first ERO review in 2009. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, underpins the programme. Teachers promote the importance of play in children's learning. Children choose play activities and the flow of the day is built around their preferences. Teachers work well together to provide programmes and learning opportunities that value and respect children&rsquo;s individual strengths and preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>Centre managers are capable and knowledgeable, and have developed a cohesive team of professional teachers who are committed to implementing the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. This philosophy focuses on encouraging children to develop their self-esteem, self-identity and problem solving skills through a play-based programme. It is evident in the attractive, inviting environment and in the programme provided for children.</p><p>Managers lead by example. They model respectful teaching practices and are actively involved with children. Managers recognise and make good use of teachers&rsquo; strengths and skills for the benefit of children. All teachers participate in professional development that includes a recent focus on positive guidance for children. Teachers use their professional learning well to help children develop skills for positive social interactions.</p><p>Bicultural practices are valued and incorporated within the curriculum. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are evident throughout the programme and the environment. All teachers are developing confidence in promoting te reo M&#257;ori and in using it incidentally during the day.</p><p>Teachers know children well and use their interests to guide programme development. They seek information from parents that will help them provide relevant learning opportunities that build on children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers view children as capable and competent. They encourage and support children to be independent and solve problems for themselves.</p><p>Children enjoy opportunities to sustain their play over time and benefit from the close and attentive support of teachers. They have very good opportunities to develop their early literacy knowledge.</p><p>Teachers focus on children&rsquo;s emerging interests during daily group times. They could now extend this focus by helping children to develop specific questions in relation to their area of interest. Teachers could then provide support for children to help them find answers to their questions throughout the daily programme. Planning to build the specific interests of individuals into the programme could help children develop more complex and sustained play.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual portfolios help parents to learn about their child&rsquo;s time and progress at the centre. Teachers&rsquo; observations are used to assess children&rsquo;s developing dispositions and learning. Wall displays help families to learn about, and understand the value of, the programme, and teachers welcome parent feedback and comments about the programme.</p><p>Teachers relate well to families. They support new children and their families well, often communicating in their home language. Children experience and celebrate a variety of significant cultural events. Teachers and families collaborate to make these events authentic.</p><p>Self review provides worthwhile improvement opportunities for teachers. Review findings include teachers&rsquo; ideas and suggestions for improved future practice. Building on this understanding of self review, teachers could now consider how they could respond more effectively to boys&rsquo; learning preferences.</p><p>ERO and centre managers agree that further review and development work should include consideration of how:</p><ul>
<li>children&rsquo;s emerging interests can be extended and sustained throughout the programme</li>
<li>teachers and managers could respond more effectively to boys&rsquo; learning preferences.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KINZ Sandringham Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have&nbsp;taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>29 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service&nbsp;</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3><b>About ERO Reviews</b></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3><b>Review focus</b></h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3><b>Review Coverage</b></h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h4>Disclaimer</h4><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically.
