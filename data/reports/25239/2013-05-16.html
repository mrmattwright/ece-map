<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>XL Preschool is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>XL Preschool, in Papakura, provides full day early childhood education and care for up to 35 children aged from birth to five years. It has specific areas for children under and over two years of age, and all children play together for parts of the day in keeping with the centre‚Äôs family-orientated philosophy. The centre is licensed under the 1998 Early Childhood Regulations and centre managers are working towards meeting the 2008 licensing criteria.</p><p>The preschool has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2010 ERO review, there have been improvements to the programme and a new centre manager has been appointed. There is a good combination of experienced teachers, newly qualified teachers and teachers in training. New resources have been purchased and the owner has plans to upgrade the centre‚Äôs learning environment.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, play cooperatively and communicate well. They have a strong sense of belonging, show respect for one another and are eager to learn. Children are creative and imaginative, and have good opportunities to make choices about their play.</p><p>Positive relationships, a family focus and inclusive practices underpin the centre‚Äôs curriculum. Infants and toddlers benefit from individualised nurturing care and the interactions they have with older siblings and peers. Children actively engage in play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers.</p><p>Teachers are affirming of children‚Äôs ideas and supportive of children‚Äôs play. They support children to develop early literacy, numeracy and science skills and concepts in the centre‚Äôs well resourced environment. Increasing strategies that extend child-initiated play and foster more challenging learning experiences would now be useful for enriching children‚Äôs learning experiences. Teachers could also further develop conversations with children to promote their independent thinking, language development and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers are developing a shared understanding of the centre‚Äôs policies, procedures, programme and systems for planning. They have well established group planning processes to guide programme implementation. Vibrant displays show children‚Äôs involvement in centre projects. The centre owner is keen to further improve assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Centre managers are supportive of teachers, aware of their strengths, and encourage their professional development. They are seeking to enhance teaching practices through reflection on the impact of these practices on children‚Äôs learning. Implementing a formal, clearly documented appraisal process linked to teachers‚Äô goals and centre professional development provisions should also assist in improving teaching practices.</p><p>Centre managers are developing management plans to guide the centre‚Äôs direction. It would now be useful to review the centre philosophy and ways in which strategic planning and learning and teaching approaches align with this philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that next steps to support ongoing improvement could include:</p><ul>
<li>deepening teachers' reflection about the quality of the programme provided for children and their role as teachers</li>
<li>reviewing how biculturalism is enacted in the centre and in ways in which the programme promotes the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children</li>
<li>further developing assessment and planning processes to show how children‚Äôs individual interests are noticed, responded to, and built on over time</li>
<li>developing robust self-review processes that involve teachers, parents and children and which focus on educational opportunities and outcomes for children. External professional development could assist this development.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of XL Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the course of the review ERO identified the following areas of non compliance. In order to address these areas the licensee must:</p><ul>
<li>make the centre‚Äôs audited annual financial statements available to educators, parents/guardians, whƒÅnau, the local community and government to account for the use of Ministry of Education funding<em>[Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 12]</em></li>
<li>implement a documented appraisal system that promotes quality practice<em>[Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices 1996, 11(a)].</em></li>
</ul><p>The service is also not meeting its Equity Funding reporting requirements. In order to address this, the licensee must report to parents and the local community about how they have spent this funding. This reporting must include:</p><ul>
<li>an outline of the amount received under each Equity Funding component</li>
<li>a brief description of the purpose to which the funding was applied</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way¬†<em>[Early Childhood Funding Handbook- Chapter 10, Equity Funding].</em></li>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
