<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Staff know their children and families very well and provide a meaningful programme of education and care.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Campbell Street Kindergarten is one of the earliest in the Manawatu. It is situated in central Palmerston North but its diverse community is drawn from a wide catchment area. Many families have children attending over many generations. Whanaungatanga is strong between staff and the wh&#257;nau committee so that parents and teachers work in partnership. Managers work alongside the teaching team supporting the provision of quality education for children.</p><p>The current licence is transitional with renewal being dependent on the redevelopment of the outdoor play area. This area is presently under major reconstruction and is due to be completed by early 2013.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to the reviews of 25 early childhood education services within the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Staff are welcoming, caring and respectful. Interactions between teachers and children are purposeful, positive and affirming. Conversations with children are sustained and provide opportunities for children to extend their thinking. Adults are prepared to join in the fun and get involved at child level. There is a balance of teacher-guided and child-initiated play, with children free to choose. Children are highly engaged in their learning and play cooperatively.</p><p>Teachers show a commitment to the clearly defined philosophy and enact this. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> and the service philosophy provide the springboard for curriculum design and programme planning.</p><p>Teachers bring a diverse range of experiences to developing the curriculum. Strengths of the observed curriculum are oral language, literacy and numeracy, all the arts, and living science. Te reo M&#257;ori is practised frequently and tikanga is respected. Bicultural aspects are integrated in the programme.</p><ul>
<li>Teachers acknowledge they want to further develop their knowledge of te ao M&#257;ori to enrich their programme.</li>
</ul><p>Children&rsquo;s transitions into, and within, the centre are seamless and well managed. Transition to school has been identified by staff as an area for development.</p><p>The environment has spacious, adaptable play areas. The large outdoor area currently allows supervised risk-taking, with climbing and physical play.</p><p>Planning is based on noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s learning, evident in planning and assessment.</p><ul>
<li>Further developing assessment and evaluation processes are a next step.</li>
</ul><p>The head teacher has a balanced approach to leadership. The leadership model shares responsibility and uses teacher strengths to build leadership capacity. Relationships between head teacher, teachers and families are positive.</p><p>A long-established parent committee provides opportunities for parents to be actively involved in kindergarten life. Parent expertise is drawn on for many parts of the programme, adding to a sense of partnership.</p><p>Policies are regularly reviewed in consultation with parents and teachers. The annual operational plan aligns directly with the association strategic plan. Monthly reports to the association record progress towards these goals.</p><ul>
<li>There is a clear framework to guide a robust self review process. Building on initial key evaluative questions and using measurable indicators will further strengthen this process.</li>
</ul><p>The association provides sound systems and advisory personnel to guide kindergarten operations. Managers and teachers are supported to meet the strategic goals of the association through monitoring, advising, staffing, resourcing and property management.</p><p>Professional Services Managers provide regular feedback on agreed focus areas, using constructive prompts, reflective questions and sharing possible directions. The association provides generous opportunities for professional development based on teacher need or interest and association goals.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Campbell Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>7 November 2012</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
