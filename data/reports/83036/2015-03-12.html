</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wanaka Preschool Early Childhood Centre is a non-profit organisation governed by a parent committee. Children play and learn in two rooms with 1 to 3 ¬Ω year olds in one room and the 3 ¬Ω to 5 year olds in the other. As a result of reducing roll numbers the centre, in consultation with the community, has extended its opening hours and age of entry. The centre has stable staffing with some teachers having been there for more than ten years.</p><p>The centre has a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and fosters, through its programmes, children‚Äôs engagement with and respect for the environment. Parent involvement in their children‚Äôs learning is highly valued and the success of some daily programmes depends on them taking part.</p><p>Children of various ethnicities and those with particular health needs are well included in the life of the centre.</p><p>The recommendation from the 2012 ERO review for the centre to use self review to make improvements has led to positive changes. This review has identified that further improvements could be made to the recording of self-review findings.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children take part in a wide variety of experiences within and beyond the centre. These experiences include learning early literacy and numeracy skills. Teachers plan the daily programmes around children‚Äôs interests, parents‚Äô aspirations, promoting the local environment and environ-education for sustainability.</p><p>Children learn and play in spacious areas. Their learning is supported by easily accessed, high-quality equipment and resources. The physical environment has been adapted to enable children under two to easily access resources and manage their own play.</p><p>Teachers strive to base their practices on current research. Routines are now more relaxed to minimise interruptions to children‚Äôs learning and play. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Older children were observed playing together for sustained periods of time.</p><p>There are strong relationships between teachers, parents and children and interactions are respectful. Teachers use a wide range of ways to communicate with parents about the aspirations they have for their children‚Äôs learning and to deepen their knowledge of the children in their care. Teachers are very responsive to the parents‚Äô requests for their children and plan well to support the learning needs of the children.</p><p>Assessment practices identify children‚Äôs learning effectively and provide useful information for daily programmes. Teachers‚Äô planning for individual children could show more specifically the strategies they plan to use to support children‚Äôs learning. More detailed planning will provide a better basis for teachers to evaluate the impact of their teaching.</p><p>Teachers are proactive in providing an environment where MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau can see and hear their culture reflected within the centre. This also allows all children to learn and play within a bicultural setting.</p><p>The centre has clearly set out its purposes and developed useful strategic objectives. These objectives are well aligned to the vision, values and philosophy. The annual plan provides the detail of how strategic goals will be implemented within the current year.</p><p>The staff and governing committee have close links with the parent community and regularly gather information from them so that they can best serve the community and children. Decisions made at the governance level are well informed by self-review findings. Concern for children‚Äôs wellbeing and learning are priorities for the teachers and committee and there are effective systems to monitor the physical and emotional safety for all involved in the centre.</p><p>The senior teacher has developed useful practices, systems and guidelines for supporting teachers‚Äô planning. Close communication amongst teachers means that the expectations for teaching and children‚Äôs learning are closely followed. The senior leaders place a priority on ongoing improvement and provide well for teachers‚Äô professional learning and development (PLD). The appraisal process is useful and leads to PLD based on extending teachers‚Äô expertise and providing for children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing requirements. Authentic opportunities for teachers to build leadership skills are provided.</p><p>The Preschool has positive relationships with local primary schools and other early childhood centres. This helps support children as they move on from the centre. The senior teacher regularly reports to the committee about any issues and what is happening for children at the centre. She acknowledges that these reports could be more evaluative. More evaluative information would show what difference teachers are making to children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior leaders agree that:</p><ul>
<li>further improvements could be made to their self-review processes</li>
<li>teachers could better record the strategies they plan to use to extend children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>reports to the committee could better show the difference teachers are making to children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wanaka Preschool Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wanaka Preschool Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>12 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
