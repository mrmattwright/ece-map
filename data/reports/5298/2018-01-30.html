</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raureka Kindergarten is in Hastings. It opens Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm for children aged from two to five years. The philosophy statement reflects high expectations for all tamariki and views children and whƒÅnau as the seed of all potential.</p><p>The May 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development, including: assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning; intentional teaching; culturally responsive practices; transition to school processes; working with younger children; and best practice in relation to philosophy. Progress has been made in relation to all these key next steps.</p><p>There have been a number of staff changes including a new head teacher who was appointed in July 2017. All staff are fully qualified.</p><p>Raureka is one of 16 kindergartens governed and managed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). An ongoing programme of restructuring began in 2016 and the association has experienced significant changes at all levels. A new general manager was appointed in January 2016.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that the association should: establish, review and monitor the implementation of guiding documents in individual kindergartens; undertake self review at association level; and monitor the strategic use of equity funding in this kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Heretaunga Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children are engaged in sustained play, sharing and turn taking. They are supported to develop their social competency skills. Children are empowered to contribute to the programme and to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging to their kindergarten whƒÅnau and community. Adults encourage them to develop their independence, problem-solve, inquire and take risks. Caring, respectful and trusting relationships between children, their peers and their teachers are evident.</p><p>The language and culture of MƒÅori children are well supported. A range of te ƒÅo MƒÅori resources promotes a well-developed, bicultural curriculum. Kaupapa MƒÅori concepts of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and wairuatanga are woven seamlessly throughout the curriculum, contributing to the environment, practices and routines. The leadership of teachers is promoting a shared understanding of te ƒÅo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of Pacific children's language and culture. They recognise this as an area for further development.</p><p>An inclusive environment is promoted for children who require additional learning support. Teachers work in partnership with whƒÅnau and external agencies to achieve positive learning outcomes</p><p>Teachers are continuing to strengthen their assessment of children's learning. They have accessed professional development to further support them. A new framework to guide practice is in place to better reflect children‚Äôs language, culture and identity and complexity of children‚Äôs learning over time.</p><p>Spontaneous reviews have been undertaken in response to the needs of younger children. These have led to improved outcomes<em>.</em> Internal evaluation is developing. Teachers recognise that evaluating the impact of curriculum decisions on outcomes for children is a key next step. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>A well-considered approach supports children and their whƒÅnau transition into the kindergarten and onto school. Relationships between teachers, parents and families are strong. They support children's daily transitions between centre and home. A key teacher model fosters relationships with children and their families.</p><p>Significant changes to the kindergarten since the previous ERO review are evident. A strong team culture is developing through a shared leadership approach that draws on teachers' strengths and interests. A comprehensive range of guiding documents promotes consistent practice.</p><p>The governance and leadership team is well placed to continue to manage ongoing change and to set the strategic direction for the association to promote future sustainability. Good progress is being made in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO review. Continuing to strengthen systems to monitor progress in individual kindergartens remains a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that key next steps are for leaders and teachers to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning to embed the changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for continuous improvement in children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of Heretaunga Kindergarten Association should continue to strengthen processes for monitoring the implementation of guiding documentation for programme delivery and kindergarten operation. Particular attention should be given to increasing consistency in reviewing, evaluating and improving teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raureka Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified non-compliance in relation to health and safety.</p><p>In order to address this the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the child protection policy meets the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS31]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of ERO‚Äôs evaluation the association is taking steps to address this matter.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Raureka Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>30 January 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
