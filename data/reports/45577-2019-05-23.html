</table><p>Angels Childcare - New Lynn¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Angels Childcare - New Lynn is privately owned and operates from a purpose-built centre. The centre is licensed for 130 children, including 25 children up to two years of age. Children come from culturally diverse backgrounds, and the roll includes a small number of MƒÅori children.</p><p>Christian values and the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are reflected in the centre programmes. Relationships and aroha guide the centre's philosophy. Staff are committed to providing a child-focused environment where children feel a strong sense of love and belonging.</p><p>The experienced centre manager is assisted by a curriculum leader and a team of predominantly qualified staff. Head teachers in five rooms have responsibility for care routines and programme implementation. Some teachers are of the same cultural backgrounds as some families, and are able to speak with children in their home languages.</p><p>The centre provides a 'Free Kindy' service for children from three to five years of age. It offers three sessions free of charge for those parents who are either studying, seeking employment or do not require full-day care for their children.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 report, there has been a focus on embedding good practices, refining planning and assessment, and strengthening bicultural practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy periods of uninterrupted play in a culturally diverse and inclusive environment. Teachers know the children well and there is a strong sense of respect and belonging in the centre. Children have easy access to a variety of resources and make independent choices about their play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have their own rooms and outdoor play area. They move around the centre freely enjoying many opportunities to make choices. Routines are unhurried, and respectful care practices support the development of self-help skills and independence. Teachers skilfully foster children's developing language. Parents are kept well informed of their children's routines and progress through daily communications.</p><p>The experienced teachers work collaboratively. They demonstrate an understanding of children through their discussions and written observations. Teachers have focused on child-led learning and ensuring their dispositions are supported. Teachers' understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Maori Learners,</em> is woven into learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers' knowledge of children's learning is documented well in their individual portfolios. Programme planning is responsive to children's interests, and parents receive good information about their children's learning and development. They have opportunities to learn about science and the natural environment, as well as developing their physical capability and imaginative play in the spacious outdoor area.</p><p>A strong commitment to biculturalism is evident in the way that bicultural practices enrich the programme. Teachers value and are committed to incorporating the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in their practices. Te reo MƒÅori is used confidently in the context of children's play, and at group times. Teachers model good practice and help colleagues to develop their knowledge and skills. Teachers respond to the multicultural community by sharing their languages and cultures with the children.</p><p>Relationships with parents and whƒÅnau are well established. Parents appreciate the care and nurturing their children receive across the centre. Written surveys, informal discussions and electronic communications are used to support parents to be partners in their children's learning. Teachers have strengthened their focus on building learning partnerships with families. Transitions between the rooms are managed very well.</p><p>Thoughtful presentation of the environment and a wide variety of resources foster children's creativity. The print and photo rich walls illustrate the learning that is happening in the centre for the parent community. Children's cultures are well represented in displays.</p><p>Leaders work collaboratively and are supported by external advisers. Teachers' individual strengths and interests are recognised. Individual inquiry goals provide opportunities for further professional development and leadership. Leaders are supporting new teachers to build their evaluative practice through the appraisal system. Targeted professional learning and internal evaluation have helped to ensure good quality can be maintained.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. Leaders have a clear vision and a strong commitment to building teachers' capability and leadership. A sound policy and management framework guides practice. Comprehensive internal evaluation processes have been established. The leadership team has created a professional learning culture based on high expectations and continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen the documentation of parent aspirations in their child's assessment records</li>
<li>extending children's critical thinking through planning</li>
<li>recognising and responding more purposefully to children‚Äôs prior knowledge</li>
<li>continuing to refine the use of evaluative questions to deepen and increase the rigour of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Angels Childcare - New Lynn completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>23 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
