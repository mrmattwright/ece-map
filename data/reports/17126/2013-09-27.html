</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kohukohu Playcentre provides early childhood education for children up to the age of five. The playcentre has an afternoon session on Mondays and a morning session on Thursdays. It operates as a parent cooperative and is managed by parents/whƒÅnau who attend sessions with their children. The Far North Playcentre Association provides support and an administrative framework for centre operations.</p><p>The Kohukohu Playcentre philosophy focuses on children learning through play with the support of knowledgeable adults. These two aspects of the philosophy were very evident in the centre documents and in the practice at the centre.</p><p>The 2009 ERO report recommended the centre continue to develop deeper conversations with children, and use self-review processes to further improve programme planning, evaluation, and health and safety provisions. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident learners. They choose from a wide range of easily accessible resources when initiating their own play. They play independently and cooperatively with each other. Children sustain their creative play with the support of parents playing alongside them and having fun.</p><p>Parents respect each child‚Äôs uniqueness and individuality. Te reo MƒÅori is strongly woven through the programme. Adults engage with children to build on group and individual interests. Children respond well to these interactions. There is a strong sense of a community of learners at play. Parents review the programme at the end of each session to share information and help them plan subsequent programmes.</p><p>The committee works cooperatively with the centre community to provide a well resourced and dynamic centre. The officeholders work as a team to ensure that sessions are well organised and managed. They encourage parents to share their strengths in order to enhance the programme. More experienced centre members provide support for newer parents. This helps parents to continually develop their role as educators and to learn about their own and other people‚Äôs children.</p><p>Children, parents and officeholders have benefitted from well directed and relevant professional development provided by the NZ Playcentre Federation. Ongoing self review helps to maintain a focus on promoting positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>A centre support worker attends weekly sessions. She provides invaluable support and guidance for parents and caregivers. Her role includes taking parent groups through parent education courses at various levels and modelling effective ways to promote learning for children through play. Parents are eager to be involved in these learning opportunities.</p><p>Centre members value the close communication and support they receive from the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that the priorities for the centre are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>encouraging parents to engage in and complete playcentre qualifications</li>
<li>refining processes and documents of regular self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kohukohu Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kohukohu Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
