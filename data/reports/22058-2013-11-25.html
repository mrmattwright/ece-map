</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Windy Ridge Playcentre provides for up to 30 children and their families. The playcentre is cooperatively managed and families who are members implement the programmes for children. Centre practices are based on the playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre offers three family sessions each week and a ‚ÄòBig Kids‚Äô session for older children. A paid co-ordinator is employed to lead this session.</p><p>Good quality practices identified in ERO‚Äôs 2010 report remain evident. In the past three years, a group of experienced and newer members have worked together to further improve the quality of teaching and learning, curriculum implementation and long-term planning.</p><p>The playcentre operates as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association, an umbrella organisation for twenty one playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The Association manages and distributes centres‚Äô funding and provides a training programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve playcentre reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are regularly involved in meaningful and sustained play. The play centre‚Äôs tone is calm and settled. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to explore and make decisions and have free access to a well-resourced environment. Older children have frequent opportunities to play cooperatively with each other and to express their thoughts and ideas. Respectful and reciprocal relationships between adults and children are a feature of the programme and provide a strong foundation for children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Centre members use effective teaching approaches and skilfully work alongside children. Experienced members model high quality practices and support newer members to develop their understandings. As a result of these good practices, children are engaged in complex play and empowered to take responsibility for their learning.</p><p>The playcentre‚Äôs curriculum is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum and the belief that children are capable and competent learners. Members have a sound knowledge of a play- based curriculum that is highly responsive to children‚Äôs emerging interests. They work together, contributing their ideas and interests to enrich children‚Äôs experiences. Members document children‚Äôs learning in well presented and easily accessible individual portfolios.</p><p>The centre is effectively managed. Members work collaboratively to promote a high level of engagement and belief in the centre‚Äôs vision. They are regularly involved in playcentre training. Established mentoring and ‚Äòbuddy‚Äô systems have resulted in a confident group of members who are strategic and reflective in their approach to centre development. Focused and purposeful self review contributes to a culture of ongoing improvement and sustainability.</p><p>A bicultural partnership with whƒÅnau MƒÅori is evident in association operations. The management team have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults‚Äô and children‚Äôs familiarity with te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Members at Windy Ridge Playcentre plan to review how they could further support tamariki MƒÅori and their whƒÅnau to experience belonging and success at the centre.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. They are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre and actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association. The management team demonstrates the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise.</p><p>The Association provides effective support to help Windy Ridge Playcentre remain very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children. Members particularly appreciate the support and guidance provided by the field officer.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing high quality practices, ERO and centre members agree that members could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen their focus on children‚Äôs learning in assessment and self-review records</li>
<li>follow up on identified next steps to extend children‚Äôs learning and show their progress over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Windy Ridge Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Windy Ridge Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
