</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Randwick Park is one of 19 Kindercare centres in the Auckland region. It is licensed to provide education and care for a maximum of 70 children, including 25 up to two years of age. The purpose-built facility is adjacent to the local primary school. The centre serves a highly diverse community. Most children have Māori or Pacific heritage. Many families speak more than one language.</p><p>The centre philosophy acknowledges Māori as tangata whenua and recognises the importance of family/whānau as children's first teachers. It promotes a caring and respectful environment where each child is valued as an individual. The centre operates four age related rooms. Each room has its own outdoor play area with appropriate resources and equipment.</p><p>Most staff are long serving, and many are also past or current local residents in the community. They bring a strong collective knowledge of the unique centre context. A Kindercare area manager provides professional support for staff. The centre employs seven teachers with full certification and two with provisional certification. The leadership team includes the centre director, supervisor and team leaders.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report found that the centre philosophy was well enacted in the programme and teacher practice. Teachers fostered strong parent partnerships. Self review was used to make improvements in practice and in programmes for children. This ERO review finds that these positive findings have been sustained.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers value children, and have a strong commitment to good quality early childhood education and continual improvement. Professional learning programmes and recent changes to appraisal processes are impacting positively on teachers' practice. </p><p>Children and their whānau are welcomed into the well-resourced centre. An inclusive, respectful culture is evident. Arrival routines allow parents to make contact with teachers each morning. Teachers' caring interactions, and use of children's home languages foster children's wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p><p>Centre routines support children to play well alongside each other, and enthusiastically join in group activities. Children benefit from the unhurried routines that allow children to make choices about their play. Numerous periods of uninterrupted play enable children to sustain their interest in activities.</p><p>Learning programmes are well aligned to the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers extend older children's thinking and vocabulary. Relevant, engaging and inviting activities are provided that build children's curiosity and interests.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from teachers' attentive care. Children are given space and time to explore the physical environment. Teachers are responsive to children's non-verbal cues, and help children to develop strong and secure attachments. They have good knowledge of children's changing preferences, temperaments and interests, and provide a stimulating programme for each child.</p><p>Leaders and teachers encourage parent involvement in the programme, and value the knowledge and skills that parents and whānau bring. Teachers are making increasing use of parent voice and parents' aspirations in learning programmes. Children's individual learning progress is documented and shared with parents and whānau through a web-based communication system.</p><p>Bicultural practices are evident. Te reo Māori and waiata are interwoven throughout the day. Children have opportunities to hear and use languages other than English. This increases children’s knowledge and appreciation of other cultures and languages.</p><p>Kindercare provides sound governance and management support for the staff and pastoral care for families. The area manager works with the centre director to access administrative support and additional external support for children and families. Managers implement sound planning, systems, policies and procedures.</p><p>Leaders are beginning to implement Kindercare appraisal processes that meet the Education Council's new requirements. Teachers and leaders are now working with a cycle of inquiry to strengthen leadership and teaching practices. These new processes have the potential to deepen leaders' and teachers' reflective practice from self-review to internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Improvement priorities include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen home/centre partnerships and support whānau/family as children's first teachers</li>
<li>embed recent changes to appraisal processes to strengthen reflective practice and internal evaluation</li>
<li>implement culturally responsive teaching and learning approaches to enhance children's self-management of their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres Randwick Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres Randwick Park will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</p><p>13 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
