</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Planet Sunshine Early Childhood Service operates in the Children's Ward of Hauora TairƒÅwhiti, Gisborne Hospital. The service is operated by one Hospital Play Specialist (HPS) who is a registered early childhood teacher. The playroom is licensed to cater for 11 children under primary school age, including five aged up to two years. The HPS is part of the multidisciplinary teams that support children's development, learning and emotional wellbeing when they are hospitalised. She also contributes to the wider aspects of paediatric care, providing support at bedsides for hospitalised children of primary and secondary school age, their siblings and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The Clinical Care Manager for Women, Children and Youth has oversight of the management and operation of the service. The Children's Ward Clinical Nurse Manager oversees day-to-day management. A healthcare assistant is available to support the HPS.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance of developing responsive, reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and a safe and welcoming environment that celebrates cultural diversity and honours the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The April 2016 ERO report identified that significant development of practice was needed particularly in relation to: supporting children with diverse needs; planning for learning; and development of internal evaluation.</p><p>Management needed to: revise the philosophy underpinning teaching and learning; develop guidelines to support practice and understanding of responsibilities; establish long-term planning and improved understanding of hospital-based education and care legislation; and support for teacher development.</p><p>Non-compliance with the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> was also identified. Since that time, the service has received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Progress is evident. However, some aspects of compliance continue to need addressing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hospital Play Specialist practice is strongly driven by the centre philosophy and waka values of Hauora TairƒÅwhiti. Priority is given to developing responsive relationships with parents and whƒÅnau to support the wellbeing of their children in the hospital situation. This includes their transitions into the hospital and also on to other services.</p><p>Families' cultures, languages and identities and te ao MƒÅori are valued and acknowledged. This commitment is reflected in the play service's strategic intent that has been established since the previous ERO review, to guide development. The HPS has identified that seeking connections in the community to support the building of authentic relationships in her hospital role will continue. She also plans to continue to develop the multicultural perspective in the physical environment.</p><p>The playroom is resourced to support a range of interests and activities, including for infants and toddlers. Children and adults enjoy the opportunities provided for respite and socialisation. An outdoor area is being improved over time. Plans are in place to redevelop the space and replace equipment. Families continue to help with the development of the garden.</p><p>The HPS uses a range of effective strategies to promote children's engagement and participation in the experiences offered. Parents are encouraged to share home information that is valued and used to make purposeful connections with children.</p><p>Appropriately responsive planning is developed by the HPS, in collaboration with parents and whƒÅnau, to support children's participation in the hospital setting. Individual development plans for long-term children record their special interests and strategies to promote their continued wellbeing over time. The HPS has identified the need to continue to work on making the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, more visible in planning and seek appropriate professional learning and development to support understanding and implementation of the revised curriculum. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction. Guiding documents for curriculum should also be developed to support sustainability of practice and programme evaluation.</p><p>The HPS is an integral part of the multidisciplinary teams and valued in her role. She is pro-active in seeking ways to strengthen outcomes for children and encouraged and supported to take up development opportunities. The SELO process has helped establish professional networks.</p><p>Some work has been undertaken to improve review processes. Parent and whƒÅnau views are regularly sought and responded to. A framework for internal evaluation has been adopted. Further development of understanding and use of this framework is necessary.</p><p>An appraisal process for the HPS, linked to the code of practice for teachers, is in the early stages of implementation. This has the potential to support ongoing improvement in practice. The HPS has collected evidence to show she meets professional teaching requirements. She has yet to be effectively appraised in her teaching role.</p><p>The well-defined governance and management framework identifies reporting lines and personnel roles. A collaborative and inclusive approach to operation continues to benefit the service. A strategic plan is in place and management has identified the need to strengthen the evaluation of progress towards goals and the quality assurance process, through improved planning and reporting. By clearly defining outcomes and actions on long-term plans, and linking reporting to these outcomes, measurements of progress and identification of next steps should be more easily determined.</p><p>Management and the HPS should continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>guidelines and role expectations for practice and operation, particularly in relation to health and safety, HPS appraisal, long-term planning, quality assurance and curriculum. These should support consistent understanding and evaluation of performance</p>
</li>
<li>understanding and knowledge of licensed hospital-based early childhood service legislation, and ways to keep information current.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, management and the HPS agree that priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for learning linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the HPS appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of governance and management.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the HPS seeks the services of a professional advisor, or mentor, to support the continued successful implementation of licensed hospital-based early childhood service and professional teaching requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Planet Sunshine Early Childhood Service completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified non-compliance in relation to aspects of management, premises and facilities. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>each year the appraisal of the HPS is based on the standards for the teaching profession established by the Education Council for the issue and renewal of practising certificates<br><em>(Part 31 Education Act 1989)</em></li>
<li>the 'flying fox' meets safety requirements of impact surfacing.<br><em>(Licensing Criteria for Hospital-Based Services 2008, PF3)</em></li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>clarify the information displayed about and detail of Ministry of Education funding received by the service.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Planet Sunshine Early Childhood Service will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework NgƒÅ Pou Here:</li>
<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to contribute to children‚Äôs learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to contribute to children‚Äôs learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to contribute to children‚Äôs learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
</ul><p>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity, contribute to children‚Äôs learning and promote their wellbeing</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of arotake ‚Äì self review and of whanaungatanga ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to two years of age.</p><p>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
