<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Au Pair Link Waikato 1 is a home-based care service that provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age in the Waikato. It is part of a growing New Zealand-wide organisation owned by Au Pair Link Limited and has services across the country.</p><p>The service recruits au pairs from overseas and facilitates their training and live-in placement in children‚Äôs homes. Au pairs provide care and education for children, and are supported by programme managers who are experienced and qualified early childhood teachers. The service encourages au pairs and families to establish warm and lasting relationships and exchange experiences from their own cultures.</p><p>The organisation is governed by a board and run by a team of capable owners and managers. Due to the rapid growth in numbers of licenses, new area managers are currently being appointed to oversee the programme managers in the different regions.</p><p>The service is well placed to sustain its ongoing development and improvement. Strengths of the Waikato Link 1 network are:</p><ul>
<li>positive and trusting relationships amongst children, families, au pairs, programme managers and managers</li>
<li>comprehensive and high-quality guidelines, documents and procedures that support all aspects of the service</li>
<li>the knowledge and experience of the Educational Services Manager(ESM) and programme managers in supporting the au pairs</li>
<li>the rich range of well-documented learning experiences for children based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> (The NZ Early Childhood Curriculum)</li>
</ul><p>The ESM and Programme Managers (PM) have identified that important next steps for the service are to continue to review and further improve the quality of assessment, professional development, and the inclusion of bicultural perspectives.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Au Pair Link Waikato 1 is a home-based care service that provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age in the Waikato. Programme managers oversee the work done by the au pairs in providing education and care of babies and children in the family‚Äôs home. The programme managers report to the Educational Services Manager [ESM] who co-ordinates the care and education provided by au pairs nationwide. The service philosophy states that ‚Äòhome-based care provides the best environment for early childhood development and learning.‚Äô</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Management and leadership: A clear strategic direction and philosophy underpins all aspects of the service‚Äôs operations and practices. There are comprehensive, high-quality guidelines and procedures, based on current good practices in early childhood, that support staff, au pairs and their families. A knowledgeable and experienced ESM has established effective leadership of professional practice. She co-ordinates and supports the work of the programme managers and is focused on building a professional learning community that builds the capabilities of the au pairs and provides positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Self Review: Self review and reflection are being used purposefully to improve the quality of care and education for children and monitor the effectiveness of health and safety practices. Staff have implemented a formalised, planned approach to self review that uses multiple perspectives and includes current theory and research. Feedback is frequently sought from families, au pairs and programme managers, and this information is used to explore ways to improve outcomes for children. Recent reviews have focused on the quality of the learning stories, and the understanding and implementation of the curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Communication and relationships: Managers have established open and transparent communication systems that support ongoing professional dialogue and positive relationships amongst programme managers, au pairs and families. The use of a wide range of information and communication technologies (ICT), ensure that practices such as recruiting, police vetting, training, establishing roles and responsibilities, seeking feedback, monitoring health and safety, and recording children‚Äôs learning experiences are carried out locally, nationally and internationally. Relationships of trust and mutual respect are evident throughout the organisation and acknowledged by the business community. Programme managers know families and au pairs well, and communicate regularly with them. Au pairs are also encouraged to communicate and establish relationships with each other in their local areas. Establishing links with local early childhood providers, schools and other agencies is proving to be beneficial for children, au pairs and families.</p><p>Support provided by the programme managers: Programme managers have high standards of professional practice in their support of curriculum and assessment for children. They quickly establish positive and trusting relationships with the au pairs, families and children, and model effective teaching strategies, learning interactions and conversations. They empower the au pairs to learn about and implement <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and monitor their progress and wellbeing. Programme managers report regularly to the ESM and engage actively in regular meetings, self review, professional development, health and safety checks, and organising playgroups and outings.</p><p>Learning experiences for children: Children are provided with a rich range of contextually relevant learning experiences based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Within the home, children develop social competencies and trusting relationships in a one-to-one or small family group setting. Resources and equipment for play are provided by the family and supplemented by the programme managers. Outside the home, play and learning experiences, such as playgroups and outings, are organised by programme managers. The service funds trips and excursions to enrich the learning experiences of children and their au pairs. Children observed by ERO were confident and capable, and welcomed visitors into their homes.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Au Pair Link Waikato 1 completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. ERO and the service managers discussed aspects of health and safety and agreed that improving risk assessment documentation and procedures within the family home, and while children are being transported by au pairs during outings, is an ongoing priority.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>26 November 2012</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
