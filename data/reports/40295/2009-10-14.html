<a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The Sandbox Preschool is a privately owned, all day education and care service catering for children from birth to school age.&nbsp; It is located in central Papamoa and is licensed for 40 children including a maximum of eight under two years of age.&nbsp; This is the first ERO review of the service.&nbsp; The centre philosophy promotes a partnership between parents, wh&#257;nau and teachers working together to benefit children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The centre opened in 2007 and since that time the owners have created an exceptional learning environment for infants, toddlers and young children.&nbsp; In addition, they and the management team have developed a focused approach to self review and strategic planning, which is providing a sound framework for ongoing improvement and a clear centre direction.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers are highly focused on promoting and enhancing each child&rsquo;s emotional and physical wellbeing.&nbsp; Children are safe, happy and well cared for within a home-like setting.&nbsp; Teachers gather a range of information about children&rsquo;s interests and learning which they share with parents, whom they encourage to contribute ideas about their child&rsquo;s development and interests.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children benefit from skilled teaching interactions where their ideas and interests are extended as they develop as capable and confident learners.&nbsp; Each child is supported to develop interests in reading, writing and mathematics through meaningful learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers also promote children&rsquo;s social development through modelling and teaching ways to solve conflicts, negotiate and how to be a good friend.&nbsp; These experiences are likely to provide children with the confidence and skills needed to experience success in their learning now and in the future.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers give priority to respectful inclusion of the M&#257;ori language and culture to reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage in the centre.&nbsp; Children enjoy this aspect of centre life.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s play and exploration are valued by teachers as meaningful learning and as a result children are becoming increasingly independent learners and decision makers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
<a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of The Sandbox Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atThe Sandbox Preschool.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The Sandbox Preschool was established in 2007 to cater for children and families in Papamoa, which is one of the fastest growing areas in the Bay of Plenty.&nbsp; The centre philosophy promotes a partnership between parents, wh&#257;nau and teachers working together to benefit children&rsquo;s learning and development.&nbsp; The centre aims to provide dynamic and creative learning opportunities where children are willing to take risks in a safe, supportive environment and view themselves as capable and confident learners.&nbsp; ERO&rsquo;s review considers the influence of this philosophy on the quality of education provided for children and families.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara"><b>The philosophy in action:</b>&nbsp; The Sandbox Preschool&rsquo;s philosophy is strongly reflected in the partnership with parents, the programme and the learning environment.&nbsp; There are significant opportunities for children to learn through meaningful, complex and real life experiences.&nbsp; Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s innovation and creativity.&nbsp; They trust children as capable, competent learners who willingly set their own challenges and take risks within a safe and well-monitored environment.&nbsp; The philosophy is well understood by teachers and clearly conveyed to parents.&nbsp; The centre philosophy in action is contributing to the provision of a high quality service for infants, toddlers and young children.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>The M&#257;ori dimension:</b>&nbsp; The acknowledgement of the unique place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua is a priority for centre management and teachers.&nbsp; The core values of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga and manaakitanga underpin all aspects of centre practice.&nbsp; Teachers show genuine respect for M&#257;ori culture through the inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful contexts throughout each day.&nbsp; Children enjoy this aspect of centre life and as a result they are developing a growing appreciation and understanding of M&#257;ori language and protocols.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Child-initiated play:</b>&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s play and exploration are valued by teachers as meaningful learning.&nbsp; The programme offers extensive opportunities for uninterrupted, self-initiated play, where children can make decisions and develop complex play scenarios.&nbsp; In addition, children have the time and space to explore the environment, choose resources and develop genuine friendships through creative play.&nbsp; Children are becoming increasingly independent learners and decision makers.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Teaching and learning interactions:</b>&nbsp; Teachers are skilled at identifying children&rsquo;s strengths and interests and extending their ideas and thinking.&nbsp; Specific strategies used by teachers include open-ended questioning, active listening and purposefully engaging children in meaningful conversations.&nbsp; Teachers challenge children to research, ask questions and develop their own theories about how things work in the physical, social and natural world.&nbsp; These skilled interactions are positively influencing children&rsquo;s view of themselves as capable and confident learners.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>The learning environment:</b>&nbsp; The centre owners have created an exceptional learning environment that motivates the curiosity of infants, toddlers and young children.&nbsp; A significant feature of the environment is the focus on natural materials and the gifts of Papatu&auml;nuku (Mother Earth).&nbsp; Thoughtfully designed play spaces also contribute to high levels of enthusiasm shown by children as they interact with their learning environment.&nbsp; There is an abundance of high quality equipment and resources available to children throughout each day.&nbsp; Children are supported by teachers to plan and alter their environment in response to their developing interests, ideas and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Communication:&nbsp; </b>The programme is successfully and naturally integrating the communication strand and goals of the early childhood education curriculum Te Wh&auml;riki.&nbsp; Features of communication in the centre include:</p>
<ul>
<li>extensive opportunities for children to discover and develop ways to express their creativity, ideas and feelings;</li>
<li>the integration of literacy and mathematical concepts in contexts that are meaningful to children&rsquo;s interests, play and experimentation;</li>
<li>teacher use of a range of strategies to enhance children&rsquo;s communication such as &lsquo;baby sign language&rsquo;, careful questioning, and sustained conversations with infants, toddlers and young children; and</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop a growing awareness and appreciation of their own and other languages and cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">This strong emphasis on communication is contributing to a calm, respectful centre environment and to children&rsquo;s development as capable and confident communicators.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Social competence:&nbsp; </b>Children experience an environment where they are encouraged to work with and alongside others.&nbsp; Teachers skilfully model and promote strategies for solving conflicts, negotiation and being a good friend.&nbsp; They foster an inclusive culture where all children are valued as contributing members of the group, respecting each others rights and needs.&nbsp; Children are developing the skills needed to experience success in a range of familiar and new situations.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Wellbeing:&nbsp; </b>Teachers are highly attuned to individual children&rsquo;s emotional and physical wellbeing.&nbsp; Care routines are respectful, responsive and unobtrusively integrated into the programme.&nbsp; These routines are maximised as enjoyable, unhurried learning opportunities.&nbsp; A feature of the centre is the priority given to providing freshly made nutritious meals and snacks.&nbsp; This approach to promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing is contributing to a positive &lsquo;home-like&rsquo; setting where children are safe, happy and well cared for.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Professional leadership:&nbsp; </b>The centre director and co-managers have successfully established a shared vision, philosophy and expectations within a climate that fosters emergent leadership and innovation.&nbsp; Since the centre opened in 2007 they have developed a focused approach to self review and strategic planning, which is providing a sound framework for ongoing improvement and centre direction.&nbsp; In addition, well considered decisions about professional development have enabled a sound beginning to strengthening teacher knowledge about assessment for learning.&nbsp; High quality professional leadership is positively influencing the quality of teaching and education for children and adults.</p>
<p class="ReportText"><b>Assessment practice:&nbsp; </b>There are some examples of good quality assessment practice in the centre.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s portfolios capture their strengths and developing interests through narrative writing, digital photos, movies, child&rsquo;s voice and samples of work.&nbsp; Teachers use questions to invite parents to contribute to their own child&rsquo;s assessment and extend an open invitation to centre planning meetings.&nbsp; This good assessment practice is valued by parents and enables them to play a meaningful part in the assessment of their own children&rsquo;s learning and progress.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area for improvement</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara"><b>Reflecting children&rsquo;s learning:&nbsp; </b>Teachers are engaged in a whole-centre &lsquo;Assessment for Learning&rsquo; contract.&nbsp; The next step for the team is to continue this action research based professional reflection and learning to enhance assessment practice.&nbsp; Developing common understandings about documenting and sharing the learning that comes from children&rsquo;s play and exploration is likely to strengthen the consistency of assessment practice.</p>

<h3>M&#257;ori Children</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children and focuses on the potential of M&#257;ori children to develop as competent and capable learners.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area of good performance</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara"><b>Respect for M&#257;ori:</b>&nbsp; The acknowledgement of the unique place of M&#257;ori as tangatawhenua and the values of kotahitanga and manaakitanga underpin all aspects of centre practice.&nbsp; Teachers show genuine respect for the M&#257;ori culture through the inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and include meaningful opportunities for M&#257;ori children to participate as tangata whenua.&nbsp; This respect for the M&#257;ori language and culture supports M&#257;ori children to reach their potential as capable and confident learners.</p>
<a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Overview</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the licensee and staff of The Sandbox Preschool completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s investigations did not identify any areas of concern.</p>
<a id="6-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Recommendation</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO and the Centre Management agreed that:</p>
<p class="Recommendation" style="padding-left: 30px;">6.1 management and teachers continue to develop team reflection, discussion and development that focuses on strengthening assessment for learning.</p>
<a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.&nbsp;</p>
