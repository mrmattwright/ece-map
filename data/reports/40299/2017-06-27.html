</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association Home Based Childcare (2) (TRFKA) is a non-profit organisation providing home-based childcare services, known as Papa Kainga, to children and families. This network is a standard funded network of untrained educators. It was established in 2012 to meet a Ministry of Education (MoE) home-based initiative. In 2014 the service met all of the targets set by MoE and is now a self-sustaining service.</p><p>The network values strong whƒÅnau connections between grandparents and their mokopuna through whƒÅnau care and foster-care support. Children from birth to school age are cared for in educators' homes in Rotorua, Taup≈ç, Kawerau, Kaingaroa, Whakatane and Hamilton. Each educator is able to cater for up to four children at one time, including two children under the age of two years</p><p>The network is licensed for 80 children, at the time of this ERO review there were 21 children on the roll, including 16 MƒÅori, which is a significant increase since the 2013 ERO report. The qualified early childhood teacher, known as a coordinator, visits educators regularly in their homes to offer educational support and mentoring and undertake health and safety checks. Children attend playgroups with educators, take planned excursions (kimi haere) into the wider community and participate in social and special events together.</p><p>TRFKA provides governance oversight through a board of trustees. The senior leadership team has responsibility for the management of kindergartens and home-based networks in the association. Leaders are supported by staff who undertake administrative and financial roles for the service. The senior coordinator continues to take responsibility for the day-to-day organisation of two homebased networks and leads a team of two coordinators and two relief coordinators.</p><p>The philosophy aims to place the child at the centre of all decision making and emphasises the values of trust, empathy, hope, respect, affection, communication, care and love.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified the need to strengthen assessment and planning and to build the knowledge, confidence and practices of te ao MƒÅori across the service. There has been good progress made with these areas. The service has documented aspirational guidelines for assessment and planning. The association appointed a Resource Teacher: MƒÅori who is providing ongoing advice and guidance to build practices that promote the success of MƒÅori as MƒÅori across the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>TRFKA Homebased Childcare (2) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children and their families and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Children observed by ERO at the playgroup were confident and settled. Coordinators and educators know children well and warmly welcome them to the playgroup sessions. Children engage in sustained periods of play in mixed-age groups of their choice and independently. They enjoy making choices from a wide variety of interesting, accessible and age-appropriate materials and equipment.</p><p>Routines in homes and playgroups are responsive to the individual needs and rhythms of children. Children experience respectful, gentle interactions during care moments such as feeding and nappy changes. Babies and children up to two years old benefit from calm and unhurried practice from familiar and trusted educators that promote their wellbeing and belonging. Older children are able to explore, be adventurous and add challenge to their physical skills in the kindergarten area during playgroup sessions. Their social skills are developing and they experience opportunities for leadership through tuakana-teina relationships in family-like settings. Adults listen carefully to children's ideas and respond to affirm their interests and strengths.</p><p>Records of learning and care show that routines are responsive to the individual needs and rhythms of children. Assessment and planning is well managed and families with access to digital technology are able to share the learning and progress of their children through this media. Individual portfolios for each child document the rich curriculum provided by educators and the service. These portfolios include evidence of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learning early literacy and number knowledge in meaningful contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the inclusion of tikanga and te reo, and visits to places of significance to MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning about sustainability and the natural world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trips and excursions to community libraries, toy libraries, gym classes, local parks, rivers and beaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children enjoying regular celebrations and cultural events such as Matariki.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The contributions of the educators and coordinator to the portfolios provide a clear record of visits and documents the growth and development of individual children. Adults document ideas for extending the strengths and interests of children. Coordinators and educators access equipment to support these ideas to be implemented. WhƒÅnau and children enjoy sharing and celebrating the successes and milestones through the portfolios. Educator homes provide interesting and varied learning environments for children.</p><p>The Resource Teacher: MƒÅori is working effectively to build the knowledge, understanding and confidence of leaders, coordinators, educators, children and their families and whƒÅnau about te ao MƒÅori. A particular strength of her leadership has been establishing meaningful relationships with hapu and iwi of Tauranga Moana. Children are learning about and visiting places of significance to Nga P≈çtiki.</p><p>MƒÅori children and their families experience success. Some educators use te reo MƒÅori confidently and respect is shown for tikanga practices. TRFKA governing body has recently reviewed the Treaty of Waitangi policy. Leaders welcome visitors to the service with p≈çwhiri and whakatau as appropriate. Children are able to connect with and care for their environments in ways that are responsive to MƒÅori values.</p><p>The service is responsive to the language, culture and identity of children from Pacific cultures and other nationalities. Children are placed, when possible, in homes with educators who speak their languages. Families benefit from educators who speak their language and have an understanding of their cultural values and heritage. Educators and coordinators share the knowledge they have of other languages and nationalities to build the collective knowledge and responsiveness of the service to the cultures of all families.</p><p>The coordinator of this network has iwi links that foster trusting and positive relationships amongst whƒÅnau, children and educators. She records children's learning and development, monitors health and safety in homes and provides positive feedback to educators about their practice. The coordinator works in positive partnership with whƒÅnau, families, specialist agencies, social workers and community services to access appropriate support for families and whƒÅnau of diverse learners. The service also supports educators with nursery furniture and other useful equipment. Educators would benefit from clear expectations to guide their planning. Educators' interactions with children would be enhanced by coordinators making use of indicators of best practice when giving targeted feedback to them.</p><p>The senior coordinator leads a collaborative and collegial team of experienced and reflective practitioners. She contributes to decision making as a member of the senior leadership team of TRFKA and is dedicated to enacting the philosophy of the service. Effective appraisal systems and processes for coordinators are implemented to affirm and improve their practice. Through setting regular goals for research and inquiry, the coordinator team builds their own practice and fosters the emergent leadership and capability of educators and families. Coordinators participate in regular professional development and learning and contribute to the wider education community.</p><p>The service benefits from the governance support provided by TRFKA through the philosophy, vision and values developed after consultation with parents, staff and the community. There are comprehensive policies, useful frameworks and documentation that guide the service to meet regulatory requirements. A particular strength is the community outreach initiatives in place to reduce barriers to participation and promote equitable opportunities for all families to access home-based care.</p><p>The appraisal of network coordinators meets the requirements of the Education Council. This process now needs to be implemented for the senior coordinator in the senior leadership team.</p><p>Generous provision is made for the professional learning and development of coordinators, educators and foster carers. Outcomes for children are improved as coordinators and educators continually build their understanding of best practice in early childhood education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is a need to review and strengthen systems and processes for internal evaluation and strategic planning at all levels.</p><p>This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing more specific goals and outcomes for strategic and annual planning aligned with Ministry requirements and the vision, values and goals of TRFKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the progress towards goals and the effectiveness of outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal of the senior coordinator to be consistent with that of coordinators in the network and to meet the expectations of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reinstating formal reporting to the senior leadership team from the senior coordinator to support decision making at governance level and enhance internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these is likely to contribute to a more sustainable service and improve outcomes for teachers, educators, children and their families.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Leaders and coordinators access professional development to strengthen systems and processes that support internal evaluation and strategic planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association Home Based Childcare (2) completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
