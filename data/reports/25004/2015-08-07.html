</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana is one of two adjacent Montessori preschools in Weymouth, South Auckland. The Tuakana service has recently increased its licence to cater for up to 40 children over two years of age. The neighbouring Teina centre caters for children up to the age of three. The service has offered a Montessori curriculum since 2011.</p><p>Since ERO‚Äôs 2013 review there have been significant changes at the preschool. The Tuakana and Teina licences have been separated. The Tuakana property has been upgraded and includes separate provision for after-school care for children who have graduated from the service. A previous manager has returned to work with the owner to support teachers.</p><p>The team of three registered teachers has remained the same for the past 18 months. Two teachers have specialist Montessori qualifications and a further Montessori qualified teacher will be appointed as the roll grows.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2013 review noted that the positive features of the service had been maintained. However, the building project for Teina was underway and staffing was not stable. Montessori approaches were new to the teachers. ERO identified continuing concerns relating to the curriculum, bicultural practice, self review and annual planning. This review finds that good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents appreciate the calm and settled atmosphere of the service. Staff are warm, welcoming and inclusive. The manager and teachers continue to have a focus on building strong relationships with families and community. They know children and their families well. The after-school programme supports a sense of continuity for, and commitment to, whƒÅnau and community.</p><p>Children understand expectations and routines and have a sense of wellbeing and belonging in the service. They are able to choose their activities from the materials and tasks available. They are well supported in these choices by teachers. Some children remain focused on an activity for long periods. Children benefit from teachers‚Äô close, caring attention and sensitive, respectful interactions. Teachers actively foster children‚Äôs skills for positive social relationships.</p><p>Montessori materials are easily accessible for children and the learning environment is well organised. Children have ready access to the outdoors where resources are also arranged according to Montessori practices. Teachers have undertaken an in-depth review of the outdoor environment. They continue to consider ways to enrich both the equipment and the learning opportunities that it offers children. Excursions in the local and wider communities enrich children‚Äôs learning experiences.</p><p>The owners and manager have high levels of commitment to bicultural practice. They have employed a teacher who models and provides leadership in the use and understanding of te reo MƒÅori me ≈çna tikanga. She uses te reo as a natural part of her communications with children and whƒÅnau. Managers are supporting this teacher to help other teachers who are keen to build their confidence and strengthen bicultural practice in the service.</p><p>Teachers use Montessori checklists to monitor children‚Äôs development. Learning stories provide good quality assessment information for parents and are beginning to show how each child‚Äôs learning progresses over time. The stories enable children to revisit earlier learning with their whƒÅnau and teachers. Assessment, planning and teacher evaluations are well linked. Some teachers are more skilled at recognising and describing children‚Äôs learning in both Montessori activities and in relation to the strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers confirm that they now have a much better sense of teamwork. They work collaboratively as a team to implement the curriculum and with the manager to review their practice and plan future developments. They have appreciated external advice and support. Ongoing professional development is planned, through both Montessori leadership and Ministry of Education support.</p><p>The manager has driven positive improvements and fosters leadership amongst the teaching team. Her planning and self reviews are very well recorded. The manager has helped teachers to establish a culture of reflecting on their practices to improve provision for children‚Äôs education. Families have many opportunities to give feedback and contribute their ideas.</p><p>The Wee Wisdom organisational systems and procedures for the Weymouth services are well established and documented. The manager and owners are considering ways to streamline policies and to further align them with current early childhood education requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and manager are committed to continuing improvements. Next steps for them to consider include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to examine the service‚Äôs beliefs and practices so that both Montessori and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> approaches can be maximised for children‚Äôs learning in their immediate context and in the 21st century digital learning environment</li>
<li>continuing to enrich the learning environment and the quality of teachers‚Äô interactions with children in order to increase the challenge, interest and extended learning opportunities available for children</li>
<li>considering how best to integrate the principles of the Ministry of Education‚Äôs <em>Ka Hikitia-Accelerating Success 2013 ‚Äì 2017</em> and <em>TƒÅtaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> strategies to help promote ongoing educational success for MƒÅori children</li>
<li>
<p>developing a long-term strategic plan and deepening evaluative thinking to support ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wee Wisdom Montessori Weymouth Tuakana will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>7 August 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
