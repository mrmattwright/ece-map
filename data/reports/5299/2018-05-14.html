</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Mata Kindergarten is in Havelock North. It opens Monday to Friday from 8:15am until 2:15pm. Kindergarten day places are available for children aged from two to six years. Of the 50 children enrolled, three are Māori. A Saturday morning playgroup operates once a month for children approaching 3 years old. A vision of ako and whanaungatanga lies at the heart of the kindergarten programme.</p><p>The April 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for development, including: assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning; self review; and teachers' cultural competence.</p><p>Te Mata is one of 16 kindergartens governed and managed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). An ongoing programme of restructuring began in 2016 and the association has experienced significant changes at all levels. A new general manager was appointed in January 2016 and a new advisor - education delivery, in November 2017.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that the association should establish, review and monitor the implementation of guiding documents in individual kindergartens and undertake self review at association level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Heretaunga Free Kindergarten Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is highly responsive to the interests, strengths and abilities of all children. Whānau aspirations for their children purposefully and regularly contribute to curriculum design. Robust systems and processes contribute to sustaining and improving kindergarten practices.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy and vision are highly evident in practice. Children benefit from a curriculum that fosters their sense of belonging. They are curious, confident and independent. They share and collaborate in their learning and show care and concern for one another.</p><p>Teachers promote inclusive practices. They have established a kindergarten culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. They know children well and are highly responsive to their individual needs. </p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning is a strength of the kindergarten. Ongoing teacher observation of everyday activities builds a comprehensive picture of what children know, are interested in, and can do. Teachers capably evaluate assessment information and work in partnership with parents to support children's learning pathways. Successful outcomes for Māori children are evident. Their language, culture and identity are effectively promoted.</p><p>Children's and families are well supported as they prepare for their move to school. A wide range of strategies successfully promotes children's smooth transitions and is naturally woven throughout the curriculum. A sensitive and personalised approach is apparent.</p><p>A strong bicultural curriculum effectively promotes children's knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. A place-based approach reflects the local area and underpins the kaupapa of the kindergarten. Teachers recognise whakapapa as integral to the development of children's sense of self. They successfully foster children's knowledge and understanding of their place alongside the community.</p><p>Teachers successfully improve the quality of education and care though on-going, systematic self review. They strive to consistently improve their evaluation practice and processes to better measure the impact of their teaching on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and improvement-focused. They have worked collegially to successfully address the key next steps identified in the previous ERO report. Teamwork is highly evident. A shared vision sets a clear direction for the kindergarten and reflects a commitment to high quality early childhood education.</p><p>The governance and leadership team of the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association are well placed to continue to manage ongoing change and to set the strategic direction to promote sustainability. They are making good progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO review. Continuing to strengthen systems to monitor and evaluate progress in individual kindergartens remains a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Staff have the capacity to sustain high quality practices and determine their priorities for ongoing improvement to children's learning and outcomes. Ongoing development of evaluation practice should be included.</p><p>The senior management team of Heretaunga Kindergarten Association should continue to strengthen processes for monitoring the implementation of guiding documentation for programme delivery and kindergarten operations. Particular attention should be given to increasing consistency in reviewing, evaluating and improving teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Mata Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure robust regular policy review and strengthen systems to promote teachers’ understanding and implementation of guiding policies</li>
<li>implement robust social media and online policies and procedures to ensure that all reasonable steps have been made to protect children's online safety and that parents are well informed of these.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Mata Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>14 May 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.<b> </b></p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
