</table><p>Amberley Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amberley Community Preschool is in the rural town of Amberley in North Canterbury. It is one of two centres governed by the Amberley Preschool and Nursery Inc Committee. These centres are not-for-profit, community-based early childhood education and care services. A manager works closely with a dedicated parent committee to ensure the effective operation of both centres. This report relates to the preschool only.</p><p>The preschool provides care and education for children aged from six months to six years old. All teachers, including the manager, are qualified and experienced early childhood trained teachers. A centre cook provides healthy morning and afternoon teas. These routines are valued as opportunities for all children and teachers across the centre to come together.</p><p>The parent committee and staff effectively managed and minimised the impact of the recent earthquakes in the North Canterbury area.</p><p>The manager and teachers have responded to the areas identified in the 2013 ERO report. This includes strengthening assessment, self review and transition to school. They have also enhanced the interior of the centre and upgraded the outdoor play areas.</p><p>The manager and teachers have close involvement with the local cluster of schools and other early childhood centres to support the children within their community to make positive transitions to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The manager, committee and staff have a strongly-shared vision and philosophy that underpins all aspects of practice at the centre. They place importance on the bicultural concepts of whanaungatanga (relationships with children, whƒÅnau and community); manaakitanga (the care and hospitality); whƒÅnau (family); and ako (learning from one another). A close sense of community is created through the collaborative way in which everyone works together to achieve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Positive, inclusive relationships are actively fostered amongst the committee, staff, children, parents and whƒÅnau. Respect is given to the language, culture and identity of children and their families. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori is increasingly integrated into the curriculum in ways that are respectful of the MƒÅori culture and meaningful for children.</p><p>Parents and children are warmly welcomed. Many parents are comfortable to spend time at the centre and be involved in their children's learning. Teachers work with parents to provide an individualised approach to supporting children to transition into the centre, between areas and onto school. They provide predictable, flexible routines that are responsive to the individual needs and preferences of children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported by a stable teaching staff. They work in respectful ways to foster secure, trusting relationships. Teachers provide unhurried and calm interactions. They talk with parents and share information to provide consistency of care between home and the centre.</p><p>The curriculum is child centred and play based. Teachers value parents' and children's input and ideas. They carefully plan the presentation of the environment and the provision of appropriate resourcing, including use of natural materials. Children have access to a wide range of learning experiences that capture their curiosity and participation. Strong links to the community enhance the learning programme for children.</p><p>Parents are well informed of children's progress in learning through well-presented individual profiles and the use of digital technologies. ERO observed children engaged, confident and happy in a calm and settled learning environment.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The committee, senior leaders and teachers work collaboratively. They model care and respect for one another and for children. The strengths and skills of teachers are valued and well used. The manager and teachers are reflective and focused on ongoing improvement. They make good use of a systematic approach to self review to enhance centre practices and processes. The provision of targeted professional development and appraisal helps to build leadership capacity and teacher capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and ERO agree that the key next steps are to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning and the evaluation of annual action planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-review processes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the embedding of planning and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amberley Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre appointment procedure must be updated to include requirements regarding the Vulnerable Children's Act 2014.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amberley Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>10 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
