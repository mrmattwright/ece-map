<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre is well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre in Glenfield is a new, purpose-built centre. It provides education and care for up to 80 children from three months to school age in three separate age-groups. All parents are made aware of the centre&rsquo;s inspirational philosophy.</p><p>A framework of management and curriculum systems has been implemented that includes sound policies and procedures. Review and change have been important features of practices in the centre since its opening in 2011.</p><p>The community includes a variety of cultures. Relationships with families are well developed. The manager is intent on strengthening these relationships further.</p><p>A significant number of teachers are registered.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive individual attention and unhurried, nurturing care. They bond closely with teachers, are settled, and engage enthusiastically in the activities provided for them. Programmes include appropriate challenge and opportunities for children to practise skills. Children benefit from the quiet tone that most teachers promote. The centre philosophy guides teachers&rsquo; work with children.</p><p>Teachers talk frequently to children, some using questions skilfully to encourage children&rsquo;s problem solving and thinking. Children are friendly and play eagerly with their peers, negotiating and cooperating in their games. Some teachers talk with children in their home languages, helping them to settle. Teachers model inclusion and promote friendships between children.</p><p>Teachers take care to give all children opportunities to lead and to make choices about their play. The centre has used external support agencies to provide guidance for teachers about ways of working with children. Transitions within the centre are well managed.</p><p>Centre environments are attractive and interesting. High quality resources are easily accessible by children. Activities encourage exploration and broaden learning both indoors and in the outside areas. Garden areas provide appropriate opportunities for discovery about nature and sustainable living. Children&rsquo;s safety is a priority for the centre, and good systems are in place for checking for and removing potential risks.</p><p>Teachers have benefitted from whole centre in-service professional development about planning and assessment. Teachers&rsquo; knowledge about children is obvious through the learning stories and anecdotes included in children&rsquo;s portfolios. More professional development is planned, aimed at helping teachers to make links between learning stories, show children&rsquo;s progress over time and respond to parent input.</p><p>Teachers are increasing the use of te reo M&#257;ori within programmes. Work to strengthen relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and consult with them about their aspirations for their children, particularly about their focus on the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand, is intended. All teachers include waiata and use te reo phrases and words with children.</p><p>Teachers and managers should now continue to:</p><ul>
<li>build partnerships with families/wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>review the length and content of mat times</li>
<li>increase the focus on learning literacy and numeracy concepts in meaningful contexts as part of play</li>
<li>further develop management systems to include strategic planning and appropriate personnel policies and procedures, including those for staff appraisal.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
