</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kauwhata Childcare &amp; Early Learning Centre Over Threes is a privately owned service. It is licensed for 29 children, including up to five aged under two years of age. It provides full-day education and care. The centre is one of two centres that operate under the same ownership, adjacent to one another. This centre generally caters for children over two years of age and the other for children aged under two years. The centre owner has long--standing community links and has established the vision and direction for the centre focused on providing a family and community-based service.</p><p>The centre manager is supported by a head teacher who oversees teaching and learning practices. Since the previous ERO review in August 2014 there has been minimal changes to staffing. The centre has a high number of fully trained and register teachers. Leadership has responded to the areas identified for development in the previous ERO report. Roles and responsibilities have been clearly defined, a system for staff appraisal and internal evaluation practices have been established.</p><p>The service philosophy documents a commitment to providing a homely environment that is culturally appropriate. Promoting whƒÅnau and community participation is priority, along with acknowledging MƒÅori as Tangata Whenua.</p><p>The service is part of the North Waikato To Tatou Tere Ako Community of Learning|KƒÅhui Ako that includes local schools and early childhood services.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to sustain positive outcomes for children. Children learn in an inclusive, home-like atmosphere. The centre has an established culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Children and their families enjoy the trusting, respectful and positive relationships they have with teachers. A strong sense of belonging is promoted at all levels, supporting the overall wellbeing of children.</p><p>Teachers skilfully use intentional strategies that engage children in sustained and complex learning.¬† Children are actively encouraged to think critically, problem solve, and be creative. Their curiosity to explore, investigate and inquire is fostered by a spacious natural environment that includes access to high-quality resources. Children confidently take responsibility for their own learning and are well supported to develop as capable learners.</p><p>The localised centre curriculum is responsive to children's strengths and interests. Children have many additional opportunities to learn in the local community. This includes visits to the local township, school, and trips to places of interest. Transition to school is supported through visits that familiarise children with the school environment. Literacy, mathematics, science, the arts, te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are naturally interwoven into children's learning experiences. Teachers support children to develop their communication and social skills using effective positive guidance strategies.¬† Children enjoy learning in meaningful and authentic contexts.</p><p>Teachers value the importance of acknowledging MƒÅori as tangata whenua. MƒÅori children's language culture and identity is strongly valued and supports them to experience success in their learning. All children benefit from these experiences and confidently engage in waiata, karakia and traditional MƒÅori games. Leaders, teachers and parents have established close working partnerships and respond to whƒÅnau aspirations for learning. Teachers are prepared to explore ways to implement the Ministry of Education's MƒÅori assessment exemplars <em>Te WhƒÅtu P≈çkeka. </em></p><p>Children's learning is celebrated in individual assessment portfolios. These documents are also accessible on-line and enable multiple perspectives on learning. Portfolios provide a rich record of children's learning and progress overtime. Assessment summaries with the key competencies of <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> and the dispositions for learning in<em> Te WhƒÅriki</em> are shared with schools to support children's transitions.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively and have established high levels of relational trust as a team. They have some useful internal evaluation processes that include spontaneous and planned reviews on teaching and learning. Systematic inquiry based evaluation is being further developed using the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017. </em><i></i></p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The key next step for the service is to strengthen strategic internal evaluation processes. This should include the development of systematic, planned and deliberate inquiry, and the use of well analysed information to inform decision making.</p><p>In addition, leaders need to improve appraisal practices to ensure sufficient evidence is gathered to in order to meet the Education Council requirements.¬†</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kauwhata Childcare &amp; Learning Centre Over Threes completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kauwhata Childcare &amp; Learning Centre Over Threes will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>21 February 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service¬†</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </a></em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
