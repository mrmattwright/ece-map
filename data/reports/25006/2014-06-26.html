</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre ‚Äì Mangere is a centre for infants, toddlers and pre-school children in close proximity to the Mangere Town Centre in South Auckland. It operates within the Barnardos organisation, whose systems and operations support the continued development of the centre. Barnardos also offers a network of social services and care for families when they need support.</p><p>Recent structural changes to the national Barnardos early childhood services have resulted in a new practice manager, business manager and service manager being appointed to the Mangere centre. This is a change in the organisation‚Äôs management approach. The head teacher, who has been in the centre for a number of years, is providing continuity in leadership for teachers, families and children during this time.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, the centre has merged two separate learning areas under one licence. This allows siblings to connect with one another more often and gives the opportunity for older children to support younger children.</p><p>The centre has sustained some of the good practices evident at the time of the 2011 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>‚ÄòChildren come first‚Äô is a key value within the Barnardos philosophy. This belief is reflected in children‚Äôs strong sense of belonging and security when they are in their centre. They approach adults confidently and in a trusting manner. Their emotional wellbeing is prioritised by teachers as the most important factor in children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers place a positive focus on children‚Äôs health and nutrition. Gardens in the spacious grounds contribute to fresh food for children‚Äôs meals.</p><p>Relationships between children, teachers and whƒÅnau are valued. Parents are warmly welcomed and are included in the centre‚Äôs activities and events. Partnerships with families that focus on learning progress as well as positive relationships would further enhance children‚Äôs development.</p><p>Numeracy and literacy are a key part of daily learning through deliberate teaching and play experiences. More integration of numeracy and literacy into child-centred interests could make this learning more meaningful and real for children.</p><p>Te reo me tikanga MƒÅori are a strength in the curriculum and children enjoy such events as the welcoming of visitors with accompanying waiata. The diversity of children‚Äôs backgrounds and cultures is celebrated regularly.</p><p>Teachers affirm children as they interact with them. Teachers would benefit from more professional development to support the use of learning conversations that prompt and extend children‚Äôs thinking. Children are ready for more complexity in their play.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments have been further resourced since the 2011 ERO review. These provide children with good opportunities for physically challenging and imaginative play. Children‚Äôs access to materials and equipment could be extended to provide more selections based on what the children choose to do. This could foster more sustained and collaborative learning among groups of children who can initiate their own ideas.</p><p>The use of self-review practices is leading to centre improvements. Effective procedures are in the centre‚Äôs policy to guide review processes in a more systematic way.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs strategic planning, closely linked to the wider Barnardos organisation, would benefit from a section that more specifically details the goals for early childhood education. Planning that enables measurement of the effectiveness and quality of educational outcomes for children would be advantageous.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the following points should be considered for the centre‚Äôs next phase of self review. Steps include:</p><ul>
<li>making children‚Äôs interests, strengths and needs central to programme planning</li>
<li>increasing children‚Äôs opportunities for complex play</li>
<li>making teachers‚Äô responses to children‚Äôs progress in learning more evident in children‚Äôs assessment portfolios</li>
<li>improving teachers‚Äô understanding of the purpose of evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre - Mangere completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Centre - Mangere will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
