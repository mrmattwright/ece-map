</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Comrie Park Kindergarten is licensed for 30 children over two years of age. It operates in a purpose-built centre set in a natural rural environment. A small forest of native trees, farmland and community space surround the centre. This kindergarten operates a full day model that enables children to attend sessions similar to school hours. Some children attend only a few days each week.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA), which provides governance and management frameworks to support kindergarten operations. All teachers are qualified and share the leadership of kindergarten operations.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the kindergarten has undergone significant staff changes and is at present settling in a new team. The acting head teacher is covering a temporary leave situation. An experienced early childhood teacher who is new to the centre, a long term reliever and an administration and lunch cover person complete the staff team. Teachers intend to review the kindergarten's philosophy to ensure clear understanding and consistency in their practice.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted good teaching practices, a connection with the local Māori community and sound relationships with families. The report identified teachers' intentions to explore further ways of developing self review, to build bicultural practice, strengthen transitions to school and enrich the environment. All of these development areas have been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to settle quickly into making independent choices about their play. They engage confidently with teachers who work with children in respectful ways. Teachers' knowledge of children and the community is evident in the positive, friendly relationships and partnerships they have with children and parents.</p><p>Children have a good understanding of their own abilities and the environment. Teachers capitalise on this by providing programmes that enable children to build their skills and knowledge. Reflection on the provision of resources has led to an increase in materials and equipment to match children's interests and strengths. This has resulted in children's extended engagement, avid conversations and collaborative play. Teachers work consistently with children, using questioning and building language to sustain play. Leadership across the teaching team is helping teachers to provide well for children's learning.</p><p>New assessment processes are helping teachers to record their support for children's interests and any new or extended learning. These processes are guiding teachers' reflections about the quality of their practices. Children's portfolios show teachers' knowledge of individual children and their growing dispositions as learners.</p><p>Teachers' professional relationships with parents remain strong and encouraging. Parents play an active role in the kindergarten, and contribute to the programme particularly through daily baking sessions with children. Children are free to choose how they manage their own snack times but gather briefly for a blessing, shared baking and conversations.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to increasing the focus on te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme is positive. Teachers are becoming more confident and intend continuing to build their knowledge and competence. Their vision 'Ngā Kākano Apōpō - The Seeds of Tomorrow' gifted to them by a kaumātua reflects the importance of the community in supporting children's learning.</p><p>The relationship teachers have formed with the local school is having positive outcomes for children. A 'buddy system' has been established, with senior students coming to the kindergarten regularly to form bonds with the children who will attend the school. Teachers' strengthening of transition processes has been as a result of professional development and thoughtful review of their own practice.</p><p>The kindergarten environment has undergone significant change since the 2013 ERO review. The environment reflects the rural setting and community. It is well resourced to challenge and support children's learning. Children are confident and capable and manage physical challenges in the playground with ease. They take 'safe' risks and share pleasure in being successful in their physical competence. The teachers' focus on sustainability and kaitiakitanga (guardianship) of the environment has earned them an Enviroschool Silver Award.</p><p>The Association's governance practices are effective. Its long-term direction continues to focus on continually improving learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>very good support and guidance by Association personnel, especially in the development of culturally responsive practices and the integration of te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful for children</li>
<li>
<p>new teacher appraisal systems, and professional learning that focuses more closely on improving team skills, knowledge and practice and more distributed leadership</p>
</li>
<li>regular head teacher meetings that provide opportunities for collegial discussion and support.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for kindergarten development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing support for literacy, numeracy and science in play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing teachers' confidence with new assessment and planning processes, and in recording decision-making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teacher understanding and confidence in using te reo Māori in the programme and in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>continuing to build evaluative capacity in self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Comrie Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Comrie Park Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
