</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Y Kids is a mixed-aged, early childhood centre that operates under the umbrella of the local YMCA in central Gisborne. The service is licensed to provide all day education and care for 35 children, including 10 up to two years old. YMCA management provides business support for the centre and an early childhood services manager provides oversight for three services in the Gisborne area. The centre manager and the assistant supervisor worked at the centre at the time of the 2012 ERO review, and the majority of teachers are new.</p><p>The 2012 August ERO report identified that positive respectful relationships were evident at all levels of centre operation. These positive elements from the 2012 report have been sustained and the areas for development and review addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy of developing a community of learners as part of the YMCA‚Äôs mission to ‚Äòbuild strong kids, families and communities‚Äô is clearly evident. Centre leadership acknowledge that with new staff, it is important to review the centre philosophy to enable a shared understanding.</p><p>Teachers have positive, responsive and respectful relationships with children and their whƒÅnau. Staff warmly greet children as they arrive. Interactions help foster children‚Äôs language development. Te reo MƒÅori is naturally woven into conversations throughout the day. Children‚Äôs culture, identity and sense of place are well supported.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô need for strong and secure attachments and effectively supports their wellbeing. Consistency and continuity of care are implemented. Staff maintain a calm, slow pace in which children have the time and space to engage in their learning.</p><p>The curriculum effectively recognises and builds on the knowledge that children and whƒÅnau bring to the service. Each term an individual learning plan is developed for each child that takes into account whƒÅnau and teacher-identified interests. Communication with parents is ongoing and valued by centre staff.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to children‚Äôs emerging and developing interests. Group planning should be strengthened by showing clearer links to children‚Äôs interests and inquiries.</p><p>Profile books contain a good range of learning stories that demonstrate how children‚Äôs interests are fostered and extended. These include emerging interests in literacy, mathematics, art and science.</p><p>Transition to school is well implemented. It takes into account the changes children experience as they progress onto school and supports transition to before and after school care.</p><p>Educators are collaborative and work well together. Leadership is effective in establishing strong positive staff relationships. This permeates through the centre which has a positive and settled tone and atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers follow a self-review framework to make decisions to improve centre practices. Leadership recognise that self-review understandings and practices require development. Professional development is appropriately focused on self review. An external facilitator is assisting this process through a focus on literacy and mathematics.</p><p>Privacy of information about children is well considered. All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that children are appropriately protected.</p><p>A new appraisal process has been introduced recently. This requires strengthening to ensure that the Registered Teacher Criteria are fully incorporated, and provides teachers with regular feedback, including observations that support their ongoing development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and ERO agree on the following next steps to support ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>to review the service‚Äôs philosophy</li>
<li>to strengthen self review and inquiry</li>
<li>further strengthen the appraisal system to support staff development</li>
<li>continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Y Kids Community Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Y Kids Community Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>26 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
