</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hamurana Playcentre is parent-led service that provides education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. It is located in Hamurana near Rotorua. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 up to two years of age. It offers two morning sessions each week. The current roll of 22 children includes three of MƒÅori descent and a number from other nationalities.</p><p>During 2018 playcentres are transitioning from operating as The New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) with 32 regional associations to a national organisation with six offices. In the central North Island eight associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region (PACNIR). This region includes 95 playcentres spread over a large geographic area. During the organisation transition there is some overlap between the previous Rotorua association systems and new national approaches. At the time of this ERO review there is considerable uncertainty as new processes become established.</p><p>The new governance management structure consists of a regional manager and a centre support coordinator whose role is to access administrative and management support for the playcentre. Currently the centre receives some support for administration and a centre support worker has been recently appointed. A national professional learning and development team is in the early stages of planning for additional learning support to build members‚Äô capability as first teachers of their children.</p><p>Parents take shared responsibility for specific leadership roles. A member with appropriate qualifications enables the centre to receive Ministry of Education funding for each session.</p><p>Centre members embrace the playcentre philosophy. Parents are valued as first and most important teachers of their children. They aim to support child-initiated play underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whariki.</em></p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. There has been a significant increase in the numbers of children on the roll since the last ERO review in 2015. Good progress has been made with areas for development identified in the previous ERO report, related to planning and evaluating the curriculum, strengthening bicultural practices and further valuing the language, culture and identity of each child. Centre members have attended playcentre course work with a focus on building their understanding of bicultural practices. There have been improvements to the building and grounds, and the addition of new resources.</p><p>There is a need for ongoing support from PACNIR to strengthen parents' knowledge and understanding of effectively managing systems and processes related to documenting and monitoring aspects of legislative requirements, including health and safety.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Experienced and dedicated leaders work collectively to provide strong leadership for centre operations. A useful management plan, aligned with Ministry of Education licensing criteria, guides centre direction. There would be benefit in documenting the outcomes of the goals set in this plan to strengthen internal evaluation. Leaders attend the Rotorua Playcentre Cluster meetings which provides a wider support network for parents as educators. Members volunteer to undertake specific roles and responsibilities for the day-to-day running of the centre. They meet regularly to make decisions about centre organisation and to discuss, plan and document children's learning. Leaders have established a culture of care amongst the playcentre community. Positive leadership is contributing to the ongoing sustainability of this well-established early childhood service.</p><p>Parents maintain a richly resourced, spacious and stimulating learning environment for children and their families and whƒÅnau. Children of mixed ages enjoy making choices and initiating their play with trusted adults and peers. They demonstrate high levels of social and communication skills. Children's emerging leadership is recognised and promoted by adults.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years experience nurturing and responsive care from their primary caregivers. Breastfeeding mothers maintain familiar routines and are well supported by centre members. Very young children are confident explorers in a stimulating and supportive environment.</p><p>The curriculum is well designed to promote positive outcomes for children. A strength is the way parents use their languages and share the cultural traditions from other nationalities to enrich the curriculum. Emerging literacy and mathematics skills are evident in children's conversations and the meaningful use of tools for writing and drawing. Flexible routines contribute to a calm and settled environment and children's ability to sustain their play. Trips and excursions to places of interest support children to learn about their community. Transitions are well planned. There is a sensitively managed induction programme for new families. The recent reestablishment of playcentre adult education courses supports members to continue to build their knowledge as first educators of their children.</p><p>There are some good models of assessment and planning for groups and individual children. Attractive centre displays record recent events and children's interests. Children's profile books are well maintained and accessible for them to revisit and share their learning. Adults identify and document meaningful ideas to extend children's learning. Useful end-of-session evaluations support continuity of learning for children across sessions. Adults need to take a planned approach to building their understanding and implementing the revised <em>Te Whariki</em>. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and contribution as they play and learn alongside adults who know them well and affirm them for their successes.</p><p>Success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori is promoted. Equipment and materials reflect MƒÅori cultural values. The Matariki celebration included planting the vegetable garden and learning about the names of the stars. Members should seek to learn about the places and stories of significance to local iwi and hapu and integrate these consistently into the programme. MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau benefit from the respect shown for tikanga, use of te reo and the collective whƒÅnau approach to centre organisation.</p><p>Parents model positive and respectful relationships amongst children and each other. High adult-to-child ratios support frequent and meaningful interactions with children. Adults use rich oral language to enhance children's communication and learning. They are skilled at recognising and responding to children's interests. Parents intentionally add complexity to children's learning through providing further resources, asking open questions and planning extension activities. Children have time and space to explore their interests and develop as confident, competent learners alongside supportive and well-informed adults.</p><p>The centre would benefit from more effective support from PACNIR during a time of transition. NZPF is in the process of updating existing policies to meet legislative requirements. The strategic and annual plans are yet to consistently guide regional and centre direction. A particular strength of NZPF is the two-house model initiative for governance. Te Whare Tikanga MƒÅori promotes self-determination for MƒÅori members through regular hui and targeted funding and enacts the partnership aspect of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified the need for PACNIR management to develop a strategic approach to implementing professional development for centres in relation to the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Playcentre members' next steps for ongoing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build their understanding of internal evaluation and ways of documenting the outcomes of the goals in the annual management plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that NZPF and PACNIR give urgent priority to developing robust systems for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>personnel management including appraisal of employees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tracking, monitoring and reporting quality assurance and compliance in individual playcentres.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hamurana Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance related to health and safety.</p><p>NZPF needs to develop and document:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>up to date policies to ensure playcentres comply with legislative requirements, including a child protection policy that meets the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014.<br><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,HS31.]</i></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hamurana Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in¬†SECTION 3¬†of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
