</table><p>Although many office holders are new to management roles, their collective commitment and support for each other, coupled with ongoing assistance from the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association), positions this service well to improve and sustain good practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the association. Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions about the education programme, property and equipment.</p><p>A kaitautoko, centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association‚Äôs structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs four mixed-age sessions per week. A paid supervisor leads the daily programme for three of these. Daily sessions are well subscribed. The majority of children attending are aged under three years. A large proportion are young infants. An ongoing challenge is retaining children to primary school age.</p><p>Almost all parents stay with their children each day. The philosophy emphasises the importance of children learning in a family setting. In this way, they can direct their own learning through play and interaction with others and the environment.</p><p>There has recently been an influx of new members. A subsequent and successful focus has been on gaining their commitment to taking on training and management roles. A good proportion now have Course¬†One (Te Wai). A growing number are working towards higher certificates. Some hold trained teacher qualifications. The position of president is shared by the group.</p><p>Significant refurbishment of the building has been undertaken since the 2009 ERO review. This has also been in response to new licensing requirements. Planning is underway for an overhaul of the outdoor play area following a gift of extra land.</p><p>In 2012, the centre was relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. It has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 9 playcentre reviews in the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children‚Äôs confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials. These are freely available for children. Activities and equipment are adapted as necessary to encourage the participation of all age groups. The outdoor area supports a variety of physical and exploratory play. Children enjoy the learning opportunities provided. They display a strong sense of belonging at playcentre.</p><p>Adults are responsive, respectful and well involved in children‚Äôs play. Their inclusive and wellconsidered approach welcomes new families and provides good support for their participation. A strong sense of community is evident. The various cultures of members are valued and reflected in aspects of the programme and environment. Caring for others is emphasised by adults. They promote children's social learning and sustain a nurturing culture during sessions.</p><p>The association actively promotes bicultural partnership. A MƒÅori perspective is evident in the centre environment, programme and some interactions between parents and children. Members continue to support each other to use te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are valued and nurtured by all. They are comfortable and happy in the playcentre environment. Parents provide strong support for each other to care for the youngest babies and to participate alongside those wanting to explore. They recognise a need to reconfigure the play spaces in the future. This will be to cater for the large group of infants as they become more mobile and active in their exploration.</p><p>A positive, reciprocal relationship exists with the adjacent school. Members are keen to develop this further as part of planning to meet the needs of older children as they transition to primary school.</p><p>Members‚Äô approach to planning for learning continues to be purposefully reviewed and developed. Good support is in place to promote parents‚Äô understanding and encourage their contributions. Members identify children‚Äôs emerging interests and needs as the basis of daily plans.</p><p>Profile books record special learning moments. Many include links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and with home. Collective, daily discussions about the children and the programme are promoting positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The friendly, supportive culture and well-developed communication foster parents‚Äô confidence and willingness to become involved in management roles and training. A shared approach to leadership has been gently encouraged by the supervisor and successfully implemented. Centre operations and the programme are now managed by the team. Parents‚Äô strong commitment and sense of community should lead to a positive future for this service.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It aims to promote independence in management at centre level. Self review is valued as part of this process. Good association tools and frameworks are in place to support members to meet legislative requirements, and to think about their practice and how it might be improved. At this centre, use of these tools and understanding of self review are at an early stage.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members agree they need to continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation, particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>showing progressions of learning in children's profile books by recording how they have responded to children‚Äôs interests and strengths to add value</li>
<li>enhancing children's ownership of their profile books by making them more accessible</li>
<li>continuing to encourage more members to participate in planning for learning.</li>
</ul><p>Programme leaders should start using the association‚Äôs reflective questions to support collective reflection on aspects of the quality of the programme.</p><p>Members need to further develop their shared understanding and use of self review. Support to apply some association frameworks more effectively, particularly those that build quality improvement, should strengthen their approach.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pinehaven Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Pinehaven Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>29 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
