</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manawaru Playcentre operates under the umbrella of the Thames Valley Coromandel Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative that provides education and care for children from birth to school age from surrounding rural areas. The centre provides two mixed-aged morning sessions a week. At the time of this review 25 children were enrolled. There are two children who identify as Indian.</p><p>The centre president and parents with roles and responsibilities are all new to their positions. They have worked collaboratively to significantly improve the quality of the learning environment. The centre leaders encourage parents to complete higher levels of adult education provided by the local association and New Zealand Playcentre Federation. Puriri Whakamaru o Hauraki whƒÅnau has provided sessions about MƒÅori language and culture. This is supporting parents to implement bicultural practices in the programme. Planning for extension within the programme would further enhance parent‚Äôs bicultural understandings. The centre philosophy focus is child-initiated play and this is providing opportunities for children and their parents to learn and develop alongside each other.</p><p>Parents have made considerable progress in addressing areas identified, in the 2010 ERO report about bicultural practices and including new members as full participants in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Thames Valley Coromandel Playcentre Association strategic plan is being used to guide membership in the organisation and management of the centre. Members are currently developing a centre specific strategic plan relevant and applicable to their own operations. The appointment of a liaison officer to Manawaru is necessary to assist the newly elected membership to strengthen relationships and communication between the association and the playcentre.</p><p>Parent members work collectively in the best interests of children and families. Members are competent, enthusiastic and work efficiently to provide opportunities for children‚Äôs growth and development. They are encouraged to participate and be involved in meetings, session planning and the running of the centre. Members are also working together to strengthen their understanding of self review. It is now timely to formalise self-review processes focused on teaching and learning practice and children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The programme provides children with many opportunities to learn and play in a bright and attractive environment and a wide range of experiences are provided for them to explore. Easy access to resources and equipment allow the children to make choices and decisions about what they would like to do. Parents plan by identifying the strengths and interests of individual children, which are documented at session evaluations and displayed in children's profile books and on centre walls. Increasing parent knowledge about strategies for developing children‚Äôs interests and learning is an area to be strengthened.</p><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful, relationships with a range of parent members and children of different ages. Parents provide good support for infants, toddlers and young children to develop independence, physical skills, language and social skills. Children are confident, articulate and interact positively with their peers and adults. Features of interactions that affirm children‚Äôs learning include:</p><ul>
<li>the integration of literacy and mathematics throughout children‚Äôs play and routines</li>
<li>opportunities for sustained periods of child-initiated play supported by parents</li>
<li>the modelling of effective questioning to extend children‚Äôs thinking.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre president and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that parents continue to undertake education training focused on:</p><ul>
<li>formalising self-review practices linked to the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plan</li>
<li>assessment planning and evaluation to strengthen the way child initiated interests are extended</li>
<li>developing an action plan to further build on the centres bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manawaru Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Manawaru Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
