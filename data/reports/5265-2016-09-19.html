</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Roslyn Kindergarten is one of 25 early childhood services administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). It is licensed for 40 children. Of the children enrolled, 13 are MƒÅori. All children enrolled are aged three years and over.</p><p>In 2015, the kindergarten‚Äôs licensed hours were increased to 30 per week and staffing was increased accordingly. Five teachers are qualified and registered and one is a teacher in training.</p><p>In 2015, a new head teacher and a newly constituted team began establishing relationships, practices and systems, including a review of the philosophy.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy, founded on the framework of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, emphasises the importance of ≈™kaipotanga (Belonging), Whanaungatanga (Relationships), and Kotahitanga (Connectedness). The teachers‚Äô role in nurturing the taonga within each child is considered significant. Teaching and learning is influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy and the enviroschools initiative.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review identified that teachers needed to build confidence in self review, including determining how the philosophy is enacted in practice. The report also suggested teachers should better share information about children‚Äôs learning with schools as part of the transition process. Although these continue to be the key next steps, progress is evident.</p><p>Day-to-day management of the association's affairs is the responsibility of the general manager. A governing board sets the overall strategic direction. The senior teacher provides professional leadership for teaching and learning. An operations manager supports services‚Äô compliance, policy development and leadership. A management restructure has been undertaken since the previous ERO review.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of eight reviews of Ruahine Kindergarten Association early learning services.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The values articulated in the kindergarten's philosophy statement are highly evident in practice.</p><p>High quality resourcing supports a wide range of exciting learning experiences and encourages children's participation, investigation and exploration. The wellconsidered physical environment challenges children, enables them to make choices about their engagement and enjoy the opportunities available. They are supported to be independent and self-managing learners. The routines are child driven and a busy and purposeful tone is maintained throughout the programme.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics, creativity, physical activity and science are well integrated into the programme in the context of everyday experiences. Learning conversations extend children‚Äôs thinking and ideas. For most of the session, children show high levels of engagement in their learning.</p><p>Cohesive and collaborative team work, and commitment to the new philosophy are evident. Teachers effectively use a positive approach to manage children‚Äôs behaviour. They are responsive, encouraging, affirming and nurturing, working together well to settle children. There is a strong focus on ensuring the wellbeing of children and their families is supported. Teachers warmly welcome parents and whƒÅnau. They regularly seek and value their views to support decisions.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop their approach to planning for learning. The programme is responsive to individual children‚Äôs interests and needs.</p><p>The curriculum strongly acknowledges the importance and place of te ao MƒÅori. This is supported by the environmental focus, consideration of bicultural values, teacher development goals and professional learning opportunities. Association leaders are strongly committed to implementing a bicultural curriculum and promoting success for MƒÅori children. The revised Te Tiriti o Waitangi policy, Wise Practice document and bicultural exemplars should support development of these practices.</p><p>Useful portfolios record children‚Äôs participation in the life of the centre and aspects of their learning. There is some evidence of increased whƒÅnau engagement through the use of an online programme. However, it is important to continue to develop the quality of the portfolios as assessment records. Portfolios should be enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers documenting how they have added value to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledging all children‚Äôs cultures, languages and identities more strongly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including a bicultural perspective in all children‚Äôs records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporating more child voice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A flexible and inclusive approach supports children‚Äôs transitions into the kindergarten. Teachers continue to work on developing their approach to supporting children‚Äôs transition to school. This work has resulted in strengthened relationships with two nearby schools.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used to inquire into the effectiveness of the curriculum and measure the impact of curriculum decisions on children‚Äôs learning. Teachers are reflective and regularly meet to share ideas about teaching and learning. The association is providing good support for them to use a more evaluative approach to review for improvement. The association agrees the continued development of the Wise Practice indicators should support understanding about the quality and effectiveness of practice and operation at kindergarten through to board level.</p><p>The kindergarten's annual plan outlines priorities for the year linked to the association's strategic goals of having high quality staff, coordinated services, effective partnerships and operations. Progress is recorded and reflected upon in collaboration with the senior teacher and operations manager. Quality indicators linked to outcomes for children are a useful addition to the annual plan. These should be further defined to enable more effective monitoring of progress.</p><p>The association provides effective governance and management support for this service. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>constructive and improvement-focused support from the senior teacher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable quality assurance processes and guidelines linked to compliance with regulations and association expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a variety of operational and administrative support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective and targeted support for teacher and leadership development through appraisal and wide-ranging professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and association leaders agree that teachers should be supported to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment for learning, including promoting continuity of learning with primary school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the team's approach to internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roslyn Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Roslyn Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>19 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
