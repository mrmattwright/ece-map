<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont is part of the Kindercare Learning Centres organisation. The organisation provides personnel and management policies and procedures to guide centre operations. The centre caters for infants and toddlers, through to children about to go to school.</p>
<p>The loyal and stable staff provide high levels of very good care for children. Teachers are affectionate and nurturing towards children. Positive and enthusiastic leadership has laid sound foundations for effective guidance and management in the centre. Staff work well as a team and there are appropriate opportunities for teachers to demonstrate leadership.</p>
<p>Significant strengths identified in previous ERO reports are still evident. These strengths include affirming relationships, warm interactions and high quality of care that children and their families, and staff receive. Centre resources and equipment are well maintained, provide good variation, and are easily accessed by children.</p>
<p>Teachers settle children well on arrival, and enable them to remain settled during the day. Children experience good levels of individual and small group attention, and infants receive individual care according to their needs. Children have a strong sense of belonging to the centre and readily engage in the activities that teachers provide. The centre&rsquo;s programme is enriched through children&rsquo;s involvement in community events.</p>
<p>During the review, ERO, Kindercare managers and the centre director discussed next steps for improving the centre&rsquo;s programme. They discussed the advantages of extending the programme by including more child-led, challenging and stimulating learning experiences for children. Further focus on evaluative self-review processes is likely to support continuous programme improvement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>In the past, Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont operated under two separate licences, one for infants and toddlers, and one for children over two years of age. Last year the Ministry of Education relicensed the two centres as one. This has enabled centre managers to streamline centre administration. Despite the change, many of the strengths identified in previous ERO reports have been sustained. ERO affirms the way in which centre leaders continue to investigate effective ways of consulting with the M&#257;ori community.</p>
<p>This centre has maintained a positive reporting history. Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review, nearly all teachers hold recognised Early Childhood qualifications. Managers and teachers have focussed on strengthening the Foundation Skills programme, and incorporating their values-based programme in practice. Discussions particularly focussed on how Kindercare managers and the teachers could better respond to ERO&rsquo;s 2009 recommendations to improve self review and enrich the learning programme.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>High quality relationships are a strong feature at the centre. ERO noted in particular that teachers:</p>
<ul><li>skilfully settle children into the programme by warmly welcoming them and their parents</li>
<li>use their knowledge of families well, in conversations with children</li>
<li>promote a sense of family by encouraging interaction between children and their siblings who attend</li>
<li>provide children, including those with special needs, with a strong sense of security and belonging through their affectionate and comforting practices</li>
<li>appreciate how well the centre director promotes a sense of team work and provides opportunities for teachers to be leaders within the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Other strengths in the centre include:</p>
<ul><li>the high level of nurturing and care that children receive from staff</li>
<li>improvements to performance management systems that are helping to develop more robust appraisal processes</li>
<li>the extent to which staff involve children in local community events,</li>
<li>how responsive the centre is to the individual circumstances and needs of families.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>As part of ongoing centre development, ERO suggested that managers consider further ways to:</p>
<ul><li>continue to develop the programme to support children&rsquo;s emerging interests and learning in the context of their play</li>
<li>provide further opportunities for children to engage in uninterrupted as well as more complex play.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers agreed that centre review could be more evaluative by focusing on children&rsquo;s learning outcomes. They could use this information to inform programme planning and teacher professional learning and development.</p>
<p>Further work could also be done to promote the partnership with parents and families/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children, so that they may draw on M&#257;ori understandings of children as individuals within their wh&#257;nau, and enrich learning opportunities.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont completed an ERO<em> Centre Assurance Statement</em> and<em> Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<div><ol><li>ERO recommends that centre managers continue to work with teachers to help them to provide more child-centred and challenging learning experiences.</li>
<li>ERO and centre managers agree that self-review processes should be more specific, purposeful and evaluative.</li>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont.</p>
<p>Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont is part of the Kindercare Learning Centres organisation. The organisation provides personnel and management policies and procedures to guide centre operations. The centre caters for infants and toddlers, through to children about to go to school.</p>
<p>The loyal and stable staff provide high levels of very good care for children. Teachers are affectionate and nurturing towards children. Positive and enthusiastic leadership has laid sound foundations for effective guidance and management in the centre. Staff work well as a team and there are appropriate opportunities for teachers to demonstrate leadership.</p>
<p>Significant strengths identified in previous ERO reports are still evident. These strengths include affirming relationships, warm interactions and high quality of care that children and their families, and staff receive. Centre resources and equipment are well maintained, provide good variation, and are easily accessed by children.</p>
<p>Teachers settle children well on arrival, and enable them to remain settled during the day. Children experience good levels of individual and small group attention, and infants receive individual care according to their needs. Children have a strong sense of belonging to the centre and readily engage in the activities that teachers provide. The centre&rsquo;s programme is enriched through children&rsquo;s involvement in community events.</p>
<p>During the review, ERO, Kindercare managers and the centre director discussed next steps for improving the centre&rsquo;s programme. They discussed the advantages of extending the programme by including more child-led, challenging and stimulating learning experiences for children. Further focus on evaluative self-review processes is likely to support continuous programme improvement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
