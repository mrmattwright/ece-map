</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newton Road Lollipops Educare is a new early childhood education service that opened in February 2014. This is ERO's first review and report for the centre.</p><p>The centre operates from a commercial building in the inner city Auckland suburb of Eden Terrace. It has a specifically designed interior that is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education.</p><p>Children attend from the wider Auckland area as many families choose to have their children close to their workplace in the city. The centre is licensed for 50, including up to 20 children under two years of age. Parents can opt for full-time care or make use of the sessional time offered.</p><p>The areas in the centre are organised for three different age groups, although children can transition when ready to the next age level. The indoor and outdoor environments are resourced with soft, natural materials influenced by the centre’s philosophy.</p><p>The centre director is responsible for the administration of the service, centre organisation and the quality of professional practice. Two head teachers lead the curriculum, and support teachers to plan programmes for infants and toddlers, and for preschool children.</p><p>Centre leaders are well supported by the expertise of professional managers from the Lollipops Educare umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. There are many opportunities for parents to be part of their child's learning journey. Teachers are developing in-depth learning partnerships with parents and whānau, often through on-line communication. These innovative practices are capably led by the centre director.</p><p>The centre philosophy is clearly focused on positive learning outcomes for diverse groups of children and has been recently reviewed by the teaching staff and parent community. Collectively, teachers are working to promote the centre’s vision. Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the care routines and teaching practices established in this centre.</p><p>A calm and unhurried environment is provided for children under two. Teachers encourage parents to make generous time for settling children into individual routines when they first enrol. Toddlers form positive relationships with teachers who are responsive to their needs, their language development and their developing sense of independence.</p><p>Learning programmes reflect what teachers know about children’s individual interests and strengths. There is continuity in the flow of learning, for example the current interest in birds has come from an earlier investigation about space and flying. Children are valued as capable and competent learners and are fully engaged in their activities throughout the day.</p><p>Planning and assessment practices are well developed. Teachers notice and record the interests of children that guide key investigations in the learning programmes. Individual and group learning stories have detailed descriptions of each child’s learning journey. There is evaluation of children’s learning at regular intervals.</p><p>Children with specific learning needs are identified early and receive appropriate support. Teachers are providing good integrated language learning for children who speak languages other than English at home.</p><p>Teachers are facilitating rather than directing children’s play, and most are skilled in quality interactions such as the use of extended questioning. The teaching teams share their ideas and approaches to extend their professional practice.</p><p>Centre teachers observe the significance of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage, and are promoting te reo me ōna tikanga. Māori children are supported in the centre. Celebration and acknowledgement of children’s cultural diversity is evident in the centre’s learning environment.</p><p>The head teacher models collaborative leadership practices. Effective systems, such as teacher appraisal and support programmes for provisionally registered teachers, are used to strengthen teachers' capability.</p><p>The centre’s self-review systems are meaningful and purposeful. They have been instrumental in developing some positive foundation practices in the establishment of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Following shared discussion with ERO, centre leaders agreed that next steps for the centre’s development could include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop a centre tikanga strengthened through a closer relationships with local iwi and connections with the centre locality</li>
<li>showing children's development and progress over time in their learning profiles</li>
<li>formatting the centre’s strategic and annual planning to focus more specifically on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continuing to build on the centre’s foundation management and operation systems.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newton Road Lollipops Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Newton Road Lollipops Educare will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2  Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
