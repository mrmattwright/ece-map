</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Walton Playcentre is located in the grounds of Walton School just north of Matamata and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is a parent cooperative and operates under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association (EWPA). It is licensed for 26 children including up to 10 under two years of age. There are ten children enrolled including one Māori child. The centre is open for two morning sessions each week.</p><p>The centre philosophy values parents as first educators who provide meaningful and reciprocal interactions and learning opportunities for children up to six years. Parents cooperatively run the centre and sessions to ensure that all children have positive learning experiences.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history and has responded well to the areas for development identified in the 2013 ERO report. Members are currently receiving professional learning opportunities from the EWPA to strengthen internal evaluation and learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently undergoing restructuring and this has implications for EWPA governance actions in the future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the East Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy warm, caring and responsive relationships with their own and other parents. Parents maintain a welcoming environment creating a strong sense of belonging and community for both children and adults. Children readily explore a wide range of resources and activities. They have opportunities to participate in many experiences either following their interests, or taking part in parent-led activities. Parents encourage children to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and wellbeing, and regularly provide feedback to them about their efforts and successes in learning. Children demonstrate high levels of engagement, interest and confidence in learning.</p><p>Children benefit from a broad, rich curriculum organised and implemented by parents. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into children's activities. Children's social competence is encouraged, which enables them to interact constructively and develop strong friendships with one another. Parents use authentic contexts to collectively plan interesting activities for each term based on the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. ERO observed examples of parents engaged in high quality interactions with children to extend their thinking. Children have regular interactions with the school that is on the same site and participate in various school events. Excursions into the wider community are a feature of the centre programmes. Children have many and varied opportunities for exploring and learning through play.</p><p>Māori children benefit from the respectful, inclusive and welcoming culture for children and their families. Te reo Māori is becoming increasingly apparent in centre wall displays, documentation and in language used by parents. Parents agree there is a need to continue developing ways that te reo and tikanga Māori can be integrated throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Infants and toddler are well supported by their own and other parents to participate in the programme. Parents know each other and their young children very well. They work collaboratively to provide an environment which provides for the safety, emotional well- being, intellectual stimulation, and social support for very young children.</p><p>Children's individual and group experiences are recorded in attractive profile books and session scrapbooks. As a result of internal evaluation undertaken by parents these books are now easily accessible on a new display wall. Parents regularly update these books with learning stories and samples of children's work and play. There needs to be more consistency in making learning visible in some profiles and members are supporting newer parents with writing of learning stories for their children. Parents, children and families value these books highly as a record of children's progress and successes in learning.</p><p>Parent education is ongoing and most parents participate actively in playcentre courses and other relevant professional development. The association support person provides a positive role model for parents in playing with children and sharing strategies. Regular meetings are held with parents to share ideas about how the centre environment and their interactions with children can lead to positive outcomes for themselves and their children.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led by the president and a core group of enthusiastic and committed parents. The EWPA provides useful policies and procedures to guide these parents in management of the centre. Leaders encourage collaboration and make best use of parents' strengths.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well used to continually improve centre programmes and practices. Currently members are focusing on enhancing relationships with families and the wider community, and transition practices to support children moving to school. This is giving the centre a clear sense of purpose and direction. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agreed that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include more specific goals in the centre's strategic plan about expected learning outcomes for children. This should enable parents to more closely monitor and evaluate the aspirations they have for their children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build parents' confidence and capability to effectively integrate te reo and tikanga Māori into centre programmes. This should more fully develop the identity of Māori children and increase the understanding of all children about New Zealand's heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Walton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Walton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><p>26 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
