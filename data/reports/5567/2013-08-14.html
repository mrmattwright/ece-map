</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiheke Island Kindergarten provides for children between two and five years of age. The kindergarten is located in an attractive coastal setting that accentuates an environmental and bicultural focus on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs programme effectively reflects <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, New Zealand‚Äôs early childhood curriculum. Blended into children‚Äôs learning is an enviro-school focus and a successful community partnership with local iwi to promote children‚Äôs understanding of Aotearoa‚Äôs cultural heritage.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs previous report of 2010 identified ways to make children‚Äôs learning more identifiable and explicit within teacher planning and assessment processes. The kindergarten‚Äôs teachers continue to address this review finding positively.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of Waiheke Island Kindergarten is centred on children‚Äôs relationship with their family, community and the natural world. This strategic focus, under the guidance of the head teacher, is clearly followed and creates positive outcomes for children. Teacher practice consistently and effectively reflects the kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>Parents actively contribute to and participate in children‚Äôs learning, as well as supporting the kindergarten‚Äôs rich calendar of events. They feel included and affirmed. Effective learning partnerships with the community create a strong sense of belonging for children. They approach adults with confidence and can articulate their ideas.</p><p>Children are valued as learners and are encouraged to deepen their interests through skilful teaching and programme planning that is co-constructed and purposeful. Projects and resources in the kindergarten relate to children‚Äôs environmental discoveries. Children play and learn collaboratively for sustained periods of time. There are many opportunities for imaginative and explorative play that extend children‚Äôs curiosity and their potential to be complex thinkers.</p><p>Teachers reflect critically on their own practice and this is leading to well evaluated cycles of improvement. The kindergarten is developing its own leaders and teacher roles are carried out responsibly and efficiently within a supportive and collegial work culture.</p><p>Waiheke Island Kindergarten is very well placed to sustain and improve the high quality processes and practices already evident through teachers‚Äô focus on self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association managers, teachers and ERO are in agreement that teachers could consider:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening children‚Äôs learning skills with a focus on digital technology that usefully contributes to the kindergarten‚Äôs records of assessment</li>
<li>continuing to extend constructive networks with other early childhood centres on the island.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiheke Island Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiheke Island Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
