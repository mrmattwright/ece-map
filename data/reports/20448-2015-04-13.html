</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Green Bay Early Childhood Centre is located in the grounds of Motu Moana in Green Bay, Auckland. It continues to provide high quality education and care for up to 27 children from two to five years of age. Children and their families have flexible options for sessional or full day education and care. The attractive physical environment, with its views of the Manukau Harbour and neighbouring parks, is inviting and well maintained.</p><p>In January 2015 the centre was purchased by new owners who will oversee the management and governance of the centre. A curriculum manager and financial manager, appointed by the new owners, plan to meet fortnightly with the supervisor and systems are in place for regular communication between the management group. The centre has a team of qualified and loyal staff.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted the strong link between the centre‚Äôs philosophy and practice that indicated good leadership. The effective integration of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, with the values of the centre‚Äôs parents and families was also evident. These aspects of good practice have been maintained and further strengthened.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging. They are able to select and use equipment, and make decisions about their own learning. Children are confident and competent learners and are developing good social skills. Children play cooperatively and participate well in the centre programme. They have many opportunities for physical challenge and engage in imaginative play for extended periods of time.</p><p>Children enjoy an open-ended, play-based curriculum that has clear links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. They have extensive opportunities to learn and lead their own play. The learning environment is stimulating, provokes children‚Äôs interest, and is set up in ways that contribute to the high quality of children‚Äôs learning and play. Teachers have reduced unnecessary interruptions in the programme, and could now review the way that group times are organised so that all children can participate in the sharing of significant learning and experiences.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of the centre is the strong partnerships with parents and families. Teachers value parents‚Äô knowledge and understanding about their own children and cultural backgrounds. Parents have many opportunities to share information and be involved in their children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The centre philosophy and planning show a strong commitment to biculturalism and to supporting children to develop an appreciation for New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Teachers are committed to integrating te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into the programme, and to drawing on skills and expertise from parents and families. Good effort has been made to use bilingual signage for resources and to provide opportunities for children to sing waiata and learn about MƒÅori legends. MƒÅori parents report positively about the centre‚Äôs inclusiveness and the support for their children‚Äôs identity, language and culture.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children‚Äôs individual interests and strengths and it is well documented. The emphasis in teachers‚Äô assessment of children‚Äôs learning is on identifying their individual development over time. Teachers could now explore how sharing children‚Äôs assessment records electronically could further encourage parent involvement in their children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The supervisor has a clear vision and philosophy and is very thoughtful and considered about centre leadership. She has high expectations of staff and for children‚Äôs learning and is proactive about keeping up to date with current educational theory and practice. Self-review is effective and contributes to ongoing improvement. Operational plans are well documented and could be further strengthened by including strategic goals. These goals could then be reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of centre practices. The supervisor should also consider providing staff with more formal opportunities to meet, share professional goals and build capability. With the introduction of the centre‚Äôs new management structure, the challenge is to work collaboratively through this transition period.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre management, the supervisor and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>review group times so that all children can be engaged more meaningfully</li>
<li>continue to review and develop the ways that children‚Äôs assessment information is shared with parents</li>
<li>work collaboratively to transition into the new centre management, operations and expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Green Bay Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Green Bay Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
