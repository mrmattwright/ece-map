<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Mayfield Kindergarten in Otara provides high quality programmes for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten operates under the auspices and guidance of the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review, the centre has been relicensed to provide full-time education services. This change led to the employment of two extra teachers and an increase in the number of children able to attend. Parents have been kept well informed about the changes. Most families have now chosen the full day option, and staff and children have adjusted well to new routines.</p><p align="left">Children are settled and engaged in the programme. They are confident about their capabilities and delight in sharing their learning and achievements with adults and their peers. Teachers&rsquo; consistent expectations encourage children to learn to manage their relationships with other children and to resolve situations of potential conflict.</p><p align="left">Teachers model respectful, calm relationships. They are positive and caring with children, generating conversations and supporting children&rsquo;s thinking. They encourage children to become self-motivated in designing and generating their own play. They are interested in children&rsquo;s ideas and support them to achieve their goals.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; planning, based on their observations of children, has been a focus for improvement since 2008. Teachers have worked on improving children&rsquo;s portfolios, and on recording and displaying stories and photographs about the programme. They are now working towards documenting informal discussions that lead to decisions about planning and programme implementation.</p><p align="left">Children learn about the bicultural heritage of New Zealand through displays, frequent inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme and use of legends and storytelling. Teachers also include gagana Samoa and Samoan artefacts in the centre to recognise the culture of the Samoan children attending the centre. Teachers continue to provide high quality programmes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Mayfield Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Mayfield Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO report noted that the high quality programmes in the centre were inclusive and child-initiated. Teachers supported children well, encouraging the development of their skills and confidence. Areas noted for development included programme planning, portfolios, and the arrangement of play spaces. The centre has continued to build on the high quality programmes evident at the time of the 2008 ERO review.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Inclusion and belonging. Children&rsquo;s settled behaviour reflects their sense of belonging and well-being in the kindergarten. The warm greetings of staff at the start of the day help children to settle easily and families to feel welcome and relaxed in the centre. This aspect of the programme is clearly in line with the teachers&rsquo; philosophy of whanaungatanga as the foundation for learning. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident in the ways in which older children support younger children. Teachers acknowledge and respect children&rsquo;s mana. Good teaching practices, positive role modelling, and the clear expectations of staff mean that children enjoy a positive emotional environment in the centre.</p><p align="left">Confident, capable children. Children are confident, capable learners. They continue to find interest and satisfaction in their activities and learning experiences. They settle easily and show high levels of concentration, problem-solving, creativity and enjoyment. Children make decisions about their participation, sometimes playing alone and sometimes in small friendly groups. Their play is ably supported by teachers who take a close interest in their ideas and support them to take the next steps in their learning. The delight that teachers and friends take in children&rsquo;s achievements increases their confidence to persist with difficult tasks.</p><p align="left">Interactions. Children are confident about sharing conversations. Teachers model friendly interactions and use clear consistent messages when they want children to understand expectations. Teachers&rsquo; questions and conversational prompts encourage children to communicate their thinking and to feel that their ideas are valued. The variety of interesting activities in the programme gives teachers scope to build children&rsquo;s vocabulary by providing words to describe their interests and activities.</p><p align="left">Literacy, mathematics and science. Teachers ensure that the environment encourages children to experiment with writing, reading and mathematics. Books in a number of places in the kindergarten cover a wide range of topics. Photographs and learning stories, displayed at children&rsquo;s eye level, promote frequent conversations. Mathematics and science concepts are presented through resources, play activities and in discussions. Children use early mathematical skills with confidence.</p><p align="left">Information and communication technologies (ICT). Children have well developed skills in managing digital cameras and using computers. The discussions that children engage in as they revisit learning experiences are rich and wide-ranging.</p><p align="left">Bicultural heritage. Teachers have a strong focus on increasing children&rsquo;s understanding of the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand. They incorporate te reo M&#257;ori into conversations, and translate words in stories they read. Teachers use M&#257;ori legends and waiata as part of mat time activities. Many of the centre decorations and art works represent M&#257;ori culture. Teachers observe M&#257;ori protocols in their work with children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">In order to continue strengthening the programme for children and to review their work, ERO and the teachers decided to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">working on children&rsquo;s portfolios to provide a clearer picture of the progress and learning of each child and to reflect their cultural heritage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">building on current resources to ensure that areas of play continue to attract children; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">recording their thoughts and ideas, which are currently expressed informally, to contribute to decisions about the development of the programme and to self-review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><a id="overview" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Overview</h2><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">Mayfield Kindergarten has 12 children who identify as M&#257;ori. Three of the four teachers are M&#257;ori. The philosophy and documents guiding the operation of the programme are based on M&#257;ori protocols and values. Teachers clearly value the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their families.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Transition. The warmth and friendliness with which teachers greet children and their families support children&rsquo;s smooth transitions into the centre. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are included in the programme in natural and supportive ways and M&#257;ori parents express their satisfaction with the programme the kindergarten provides. They are confident in the relationships teachers have built with them. They have been able to express their aspirations for their children and can see that teachers have taken notice of their wishes. .</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">Strengthening partnerships. Teachers plan to continue to seek information about the history of the local area. One of the teachers has strong links to the local marae and a visit is in the development phases. Teachers also intend to include more information in portfolios about children&rsquo;s hapu and iwi connections. These developments are likely to strengthen learning partnerships with wh&#257;nau.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Mayfield Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>

<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-mayfield-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Mayfield Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Mayfield Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Mayfield Kindergarten in Otara provides high quality programmes for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten operates under the auspices and guidance of the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review, the centre has been relicensed to provide full-time education services. This change led to the employment of two extra teachers and an increase in the number of children able to attend. Parents have been kept well informed about the changes. Most families have now chosen the full day option, and staff and children have adjusted well to new routines.</p><p align="left">Children are settled and engaged in the programme. They are confident about their capabilities and delight in sharing their learning and achievements with adults and their peers. Teachers&rsquo; consistent expectations encourage children to learn to manage their relationships with other children and to resolve situations of potential conflict.</p><p align="left">Teachers model respectful, calm relationships. They are positive and caring with children, generating conversations and supporting children&rsquo;s thinking. They encourage children to become self-motivated in designing and generating their own play. They are interested in children&rsquo;s ideas and support them to achieve their goals.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; planning, based on their observations of children, has been a focus for improvement since 2008. Teachers have worked on improving children&rsquo;s portfolios, and on recording and displaying stories and photographs about the programme. They are now working towards documenting informal discussions that lead to decisions about planning and programme implementation.</p><p align="left">Children learn about the bicultural heritage of New Zealand through displays, frequent inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme and use of legends and storytelling. Teachers also include gagana Samoa and Samoan artefacts in the centre to recognise the culture of the Samoan children attending the centre. Teachers continue to provide high quality programmes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
