</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Pukekohe is a well established all day education and care service for children from the ages of two to five years. The centre is situated on a residential property and previously operated as Montessori @ Pukekohe. Children reflect the diverse cultures within the local community.</p><p>Community Kindy Pukekohe is part of the Kidicorp group of childcare centres. Kidicorp provides a framework for centre operations, good levels of professional development and support for the centre manager and teachers, and a robust quality assurance process.</p><p>The majority of teachers are qualified. The acting head teacher was appointed in June 2013. Previous to her arrival, there were many staff changes. Managers and teachers have reviewed the centre‚Äôs philosophy with a view to move from a Montessori focus to a programme that better reflects the aspirations of the local community.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2011 review recognised the respectful, warm relationships between teachers and children, as well as children‚Äôs strong sense of belonging. These, and the ongoing commitment to professional learning and development, continue to be features of the centre.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs recommendation to further develop strategic planning has been addressed. Areas for development such as planning, assessment and evaluation, and providing a child-centred programme remain areas for the centre to fully address.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive relationships with teachers and with each other. They confidently play with each other and choose how to be involved in the programme. Children have opportunities to participate in swimming and movement classes in the community.</p><p>The learning environment invites exploration and appeals to children‚Äôs natural curiosity. Children benefit from the recently renovated outdoor environment. Teachers are aware of the need to promote further challenge in the programme and to continue increasing children‚Äôs access to varied and interesting resources.</p><p>Managers are beginning to support staff to develop more consistent understandings and practices and to establish a more responsive, child-centred curriculum.</p><p>Managers and teachers have identified the need to more actively consult with parents, document their contributions, and increase their involvement in the programme and centre operations. Centre staff are also keen to increase the extent to which New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage is reflected in the programme and in the environment.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. Teachers benefit from the clear management structure, modelling and support aimed at improving learning outcomes for children. Managers show a strong commitment to ongoing improvement with an increased focus on strengthening the influence of<em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, in the centre.</p><p>Strategic planning goals are clear and appropriate, focusing on teaching and learning, family involvement and self review. Managers have considered and taken steps to improve the long term viability of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the centre‚Äôs priorities to continue:</p><ul>
<li>focussing teachers‚Äô planning, assessment and evaluation cycle on children‚Äôs individual dispositions for learning</li>
<li>promoting the consistent use of effective teaching and learning strategies to extend children‚Äôs learning and creativity</li>
<li>considering ways to promote success for MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders also discussed ways to strengthen teaching practices and provision for children by:</p><ul>
<li>using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> to evaluate how effectively the centre prepares children for their transition to school</li>
<li>enhancing self-review processes by including the use of indicators of effective practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Pukekohe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Pukekohe will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>9 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
