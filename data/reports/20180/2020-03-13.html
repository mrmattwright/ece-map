</table><p>Waiheke Community Childcare Centre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Waiheke Community Childcare Centre needs to introduce effective evaluation processes to strengthen programme planning and teacher appraisal and to ensure policies meet current legal requirements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiheke Community Centre is licensed for 30 children, including eight children up to the age of two years. Small numbers of MƒÅori children attend. The well-established centre provides all-day education and care for children in a mixed-age setting. There are many opportunities for children to explore and learn from the local environment through the bush school excursion programme.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises building strong partnerships with whƒÅnau and nurturing each child. Centre priorities are for children to become confident, competent learners who learn and grow at their own pace. The natural environment is seen as the third teacher and used to foster responsible future citizens.</p><p>The centre is governed by a parent management committee. The senior teacher leads an experienced team of qualified teachers and part-time staff.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified positive aspects of good practice that have been sustained. The report also identified areas that needed to be strengthened. These next steps have not yet been fully addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is evident in practice. Children settle well, are friendly and confidently interact with adults. Friendships and collaboration are nurtured and tuakana/teina relationships encouraged. Children are actively involved, self-motivated and play imaginatively in small groups. There are multiple opportunities for children to explore, make choices and develop their physical skills.</p><p>Teachers know the children well. They deliberately use conversations to promote children's language and positive social development, and to encourage exploration. Learning portfolios record children's interactions and capture the development of their social and emotional competencies. However, documentation does not yet include a focus on children's learning. Increasing teachers' depth of knowledge and understanding of planning for learning is now needed to demonstrate children's progress.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori is evident in the centre environment and in some practices, including karakia, waiata and conversation with some teachers. Teachers could enrich the programme by making connections to te ao MƒÅori within the local curriculum when planning for learning.</p><p>Parents are actively involved. There is a strong emphasis on responsive and reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whƒÅnau, which promotes a sense of belonging. Children transition well from home to centre and are well supported when transitioning to other early childhood centres. Many children still under five years return in the school holidays to participate in the programme.</p><p>Internal evaluation for accountability and improvement is developing. Educators now need to build their knowledge, practice and use of evaluation with a focus on positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Strengthening teacher inquiries and goal setting through the appraisal process should help identify and address their professional learning and development needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for learning that is responsive to individual children and promotes more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning, teaching practices and documentation to increase te ao MƒÅori within the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning teaching and learning, appraisal and internal evaluation to the annual and strategic plans to support improved outcomes for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing understanding of the purpose and process of internal evaluation to recognise what is working for children's learning and to inform ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiheke Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>Since the onsite visit, the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed the following non-compliance:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any windows or other areas of glass accessible to children are either made of safety glass, covered by an adhesive film or effectively guarded by barriers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> PF7.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
