</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Create Limited 5 is one of four networks owned by the Kids Create Limited organisation. This home-based education and care network was established in late 2015 and gained its full licence early 2018. It is licensed for 60 children from birth to school age.</p><p>A programme coordinator oversees the delivery of the curriculum. She collaborates with educators to provide education and care for up to four children in each session in homes. Most educators are family members and some are the children's grandparents. Most children and educators are of Tongan or Samoan cultural backgrounds. Other cultural groups include MƒÅori and Indian.</p><p>The service's philosophy promotes education, collaboration and empowerment for all children. It is consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and promotes learning through play. The philosophy acknowledges the Treaty of Waitangi obligations and embraces the diverse cultures of the families engaged with the network.</p><p>Kids Create Limited 5 is governed by directors who also make up the management board. They have recently appointed a general manager to oversee operations. The board employs four programme coordinators across the networks who work collaboratively, under the leadership of the head programme coordinator, to support educators.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for this network.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's individual portfolios show that they are developing a strong sense of their identity, language and culture. They show that educators communicate with parents and children using their lea faka Tonga or gagana Samoa. The mainly Tongan and Samoan children enjoy experiences that enhance their identity, language and culture. Children participate in celebrating occasions such as Tongan and Samoan language weeks, involvement in leading lotu and active participation in learning songs and cultural dances.</p><p>Children engage in a curriculum that provides a wide variety of learning experiences. Educators share their own cultural knowledge and often document children's learning activities in lea faka Tonga or gagana Samoan. Children's oral language skills, positive relationships with others and confidence in being part of group situations is evident. Good opportunities are provided for children to develop their social competencies such as sharing, co-operating and turn taking.</p><p>Good systems are established for planning, assessment and evaluation, and educators are provided with tailored support that guides and builds their capability in these areas. Together with the programme co-ordinator, educators design learning programmes that identify and build on children's individual strengths and interests. Assessment information shows good levels of engagement and some children initiating play. Educators keep good records of each child‚Äôs day and activities that children participated in and enjoyed. Children have fun as they learn through play, through everyday experiences, and through planned activities such as literacy, mathematics and science.</p><p>The programme co-ordinator knows the educators well and personalises their communication and support needs. Well documented monthly visits to educators monitor health and safety practices in the home and build on educators' knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and effective teaching practices. The programme co-ordinator promotes inclusive practices and effective ways of working with infants and toddlers. Programme co-ordinators are encouraging educators to increase their understanding and use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. They could also help educators to strengthen their understanding of and respond to children's individual learning dispositions.</p><p>Parents and families have opportunities to contribute to their children's learning. Managers have identified that they could explore further ways for parents to strengthen their contribution to the operation of the service.</p><p>The service is committed to realising its vision, goals and strategic direction. Management plans clearly identify priorities and document strategies to be implemented to achieve their goals. Directors and managers have a commitment to providing quality early childhood education within a culturally rich home-based setting. The programme co-ordinator's good record keeping, professional discussion and a framework of policies and procedures guide practices. Internal evaluation could be further developed so that managers and the programme co-ordinator gain shared understandings to further improve strategic, regular and spontaneous evaluation for continuous improvement.</p><p>Sound management practices underpin service operations. There are good recruitment processes and clearly defined expectations for co-ordinators and educators. A sound induction programme and ongoing support build the knowledge, capabilities and skills of all educators and staff, and improve practices across the service. This contributes to consistent and sustainable practices. Managers have improved the appraisal system. They could now strengthen processes to promote teachers as reflective practitioners. Managers are investigating ways they could assist educators to gain a Level 4 NZQA qualification.</p><p>Health and safety systems provide assurance to the directors that requirements are met. The programme co-ordinator's monthly reports keep service leaders informed of the physical and emotional wellbeing of children and of any issues to be addressed. Managers are in the process of strengthening quality assurance practices.</p><p>The service has made a good start in building educators' awareness to acknowledge the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Educators are encouraged to use te reo MƒÅori and acknowledge the importance of bicultural practices. Management has identified that more needs to be done to build educators' understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders agree that key next steps for the service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation practices and documentation at management level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher reflection and inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partnership with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Service leaders agree that key next steps for programme coordinators are to continue to build educator capability in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing planning that builds on children's individual dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in regular professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Create Limited 5 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Create Limited 5 will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
