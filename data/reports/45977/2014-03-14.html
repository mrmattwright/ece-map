</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tic Tac Toe Educare Ltd is a privately owned education and care service located adjacent to the central business district of Huntly. The centre provides for children from birth to school age in a diverse, multi-cultural community. This diversity is reflected in the cultures represented in the centre among children and staff. This is the first education review of the centre which opened in mid 2012.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 46 children, including 16 aged under 2 Years. The current roll is 66, of whom 29 are MƒÅori. The centre is organised into two age-related areas for children under and over 2 years. There is a designated team leader in each area who has responsibility for the learning programme. The centre owner provides overall management and governance.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises the importance of a partnership with parents, respect for te ao MƒÅori, and the fostering of bicultural practice. A learning programme is promoted, which is based on children‚Äôs interests, and supports them to become independent and self managing.</p><p>The centre is meeting requirements in regard to the percentage of qualified staff. While there have been some changes in leadership, the owner and staff have made good progress in establishing the centre on a firm foundation in a relatively short period of time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner has developed sound policies and procedures to guide centre operations. She places priority on the care of individual children and fostering positive and reciprocal relationships with their families. Effective self-review processes, including regular consultation with families, are evident throughout the centre and are contributing strongly to the development and improvement of this new service. The owner has provided ongoing support for the professional development of staff, and has accessed appropriate outside expertise to assist in governance, management and learning.</p><p>Team leaders in each age-based room are knowledgeable about early childhood education and model effective teaching practice. They work cooperatively with the centre owner and staff in the best interests of children and families. These leaders and staff are reflective about their practice and are focused on ongoing improvement to the centre environment and learning programme. Teachers‚Äô individual strengths and cultures are valued and used to enhance the programme for children. Expectations for the staff roles and responsibilities are clearly documented.</p><p>Infants, toddlers and older children enjoy access to a wide range of interesting learning experiences. Good quality equipment and materials that promote exploration, curiosity and creativity are available. There are many opportunities for children to challenge themselves, develop physically and engage in dramatic play. Meaningful experiences such as regular baking, gardening and use of the facilities in the local community are particular features of the programme. Routines are flexible and allow children to pursue and sustain their interests over time. Teachers support children to be independent and self managing.</p><p>As a result of self review, the outside area for infants and toddlers is currently being renovated and extended. This will allow children to have greater opportunities to explore, experience challenge and have contact with the natural world.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children are highly valued and visible throughout the programme and environment. The programme is further enriched by the recognition and celebration of the diverse cultures of other children.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective and inclusive practices to engage children in learning. They know children and their families well and have established a welcoming and inviting environment throughout the centre. Teachers in the under-two area provide nurture and affection for children through responsive care practices. Infants and toddlers demonstrate confidence as they explore and communicate among familiar adults and other children. In the over-two area, teachers make good use of open questioning and conversations to extend children‚Äôs learning and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers plan and evaluate a stimulating learning programme that is underpinned by <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and linked to children‚Äôs identified interests. Children‚Äôs learning and development is recorded in informative and attractive centre displays, individual portfolios, and is accessible to parents on line.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders recognise that important priorities for the ongoing development of the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the strategic plan, particularly in relation to long term goals</li>
<li>ensure that teachers are receiving regular feedback about their practice through strengthening the appraisal process and observations by team leaders</li>
<li>improve acoustics to ensure that noise levels are conducive to effective teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>While aspects of early literacy and numeracy learning are evident throughout the programme, further integration of these concepts particularly for older children will be beneficial.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tic-Tac-Toe Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tic-Tac-Toe Educare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
