</table><p>KIDSPACE¬†Quality Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre is situated in Napier. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 40 children from birth to school age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 17 of the children enrolled identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on children having space to move, explore, learn and grow at their own pace, supported by caring and dedicated teachers.</p><p>Since the February 2016 ERO report, a new centre manager was appointed. The centre manager oversees the day-to-day operations and supports the teaching team. Most teachers are qualified. They represent a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included strengthening assessment, planning and the internal evaluative processes. Good progress has been made to address these areas.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by Provincial Education Group Ltd (the organisation), it provides governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nationwide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to the teaching team. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based curriculum. They have access to a range of resources that support their play. Routines are consistently implemented, giving children a sense of security. There is a strong focus on building children‚Äôs social competence, so they can meaningfully engage with their peers and teachers.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for by responsive teachers. They offer children choices about their learning and care. The mixed-age settings provide rich opportunities for learning and play alongside their older children.¬†</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to participate fully in the learning programme. Teachers work collaboratively with parents to determine learning goals. Targeted professional learning and development helps to grow their practice to effectively support these children. External support is accessed when required.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to strengthen their practice to better promote MƒÅori and Pacific children's educational success. The centre should consider how best they can engage with whƒÅnau MƒÅori and their Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori is evident in the programme. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori and MƒÅori concepts in teacher-led group learning activities. A next step is to enrich the bicultural programme through more consistent use of te reo MƒÅori in everyday practice. In addition, leaders should investigate how they can acknowledge local places of significant value for MƒÅori and reflect these within the curriculum.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning is currently under development. Aims are to more clearly identify learning linked to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and set learning goals in collaboration with parents and whƒÅnau. As this process is developed, leaders and teachers should consider how they can: consistently make children‚Äôs culture, language and identity more visible in their learning; and show children‚Äôs engagement and learning progress more clearly through assessment documentation.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are using a sound evaluation framework to guide improvement in practice and outcomes for children. This should be strengthened by developing relevant indicators of high quality practice to support analysis and decision making.</p><p>Provincial Education Group senior leadership has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvements, for the benefit of children and whƒÅnau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding and take on distributed leadership roles.</p><p>A sound appraisal framework is in place that leads teachers to investigate aspects of their practice and make ongoing improvements.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children. A formal reporting process, now being implemented, provides feedback to teachers about the focus of professional leaders' visits.</p><p>A parent survey has affirmed teacher practice and provided feedback for ongoing consideration. Leaders have actively responded to the survey‚Äôs findings.</p><p>A national initiative, led by the organisation, provides opportunities for parents and whƒÅnau to contribute to the valued outcomes of the service. The organisation should draw from these national findings to inform their strategic direction.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen practice to promote MƒÅori and Pacific children's educational success</li>
<li>encourage greater use of te reo MƒÅori, as well as promote a place-based curriculum into the learning programme</li>
<li>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation practice and understanding.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and Provincial Education Group agree that to further strengthen practice, their next step are to:</p><ul>
<li>use the findings of the national philosophy review to inform the organisation‚Äôs strategic direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie<br>Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Central Region</p><p>19 February 2019¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.¬†</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em>. </em><em></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
