</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre provides education and care for children aged from birth to five years in a mixed age setting. The centre is licensed for 40 children, with provision for 10 children up to two years of age.</p><p>Since the May 2013 ERO report, a new teaching team has been established. In March 2015, the centre changed ownership to Provincial Childcare Holdings (the owners) and a new centre manager was appointed. The owners provide management and administrative support. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. Staffing stability and sound systems and processes have contributed to a smooth transition to the new owners.</p><p>There has been an increase in the enrolment of infants and toddlers. Inquiring into, and catering for the learning needs of this group is a current focus. Plans to provide a separate space for infants who are not yet mobile are underway.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>During a time of change teachers have maintained a settled environment and continued to ensure positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children are nurtured in an environment that is welcoming and strongly reflects the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Parents spend time playing with their child. Teachers know children and their families well and friendships are promoted. A home-like atmosphere prevails.</p><p>Children lead their own learning. The environment allows them to move freely between the indoor and outdoor play areas. Children access a wide range of activities and resources that promote and extend their interests. They are able to challenge themselves and engage in exploration and imaginary play. Regular excursions into the community provide further learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers are included in children‚Äôs play. They make the most of opportunities to support and extend children‚Äôs learning and foster language development. Literacy, mathematics and science are well integrated into learning experiences.</p><p>Routines are responsive to the mixed age group. These provide opportunities for children to develop independence and self-help skills. Teachers provide support appropriate to their ages and stages of development.</p><p>Teachers work in collaboration with each other to ensure the needs of young children are met. Infants and toddlers have access to an environment that encourages exploration.</p><p>There has been a strategic focus on strengthening the documentation of planning and assessment. Improved systems and process enable teachers to better respond and document learning. Teachers acknowledge they need to continue to strengthen assessment and planning by revisiting individual learning to ensure that this is extended over time.</p><p>Profiles are accessible to children and their parents. These are an attractive record of children's engagement in learning and development while at the centre. Profiles capture and celebrate the diverse cultures of children attending the centre. E-portfolios have increased the contribution of parents, families and whƒÅnau to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Positive relations between the centre staff and the local school supports older children‚Äôs transition. A summary report of each child‚Äôs learning provides useful information for children, families and whƒÅnau to share with schools.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported by teachers. Staff work in collaboration with parents and whƒÅnau and seek advice and guidance from appropriate agencies when necessary.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori is well reflected through the authentic use of te reo MƒÅori, resources and relationships with whƒÅnau. Strengthening te ao in the environment is the focus of an ongoing review. Teachers expressed a strong commitment to building their cultural competencies.</p><p>Teachers are very reflective and focused on further developing and improving their practice. The appraisal process provides a sound platform to support this. The new owners are actively supporting emergent leadership and building the capability and capacity of teachers.</p><p>The centre has a well-established process for self review that is responsive to identified priorities. It informs decision making and is used to improve outcomes for children. Shifting the reviews from focusing on what they are doing, to evaluating how well teaching and learning practices strengthen outcomes for children, is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and staff agree that they need to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment and planning</li>
<li>internal evaluation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KIDSPACE Quality Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>3 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
