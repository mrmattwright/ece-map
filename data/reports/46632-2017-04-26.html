</table><p>Sunflowers Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunflowers Preschool opened in February 2015. It is a small, rural centre in North Canterbury. The centre is privately owned and located in the former, purpose-built Playcentre building.</p><p>The centre provides education and care three days a week for children from two years to school age. Families from a diverse range of cultures attend the centre.</p><p>The centre operates with two fully-qualified and certified teachers who are supported by other trained adults. This is the centre's first education review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the learning programme. They experience respectful, positive relationships with each other, their teachers and staff. Older children readily support the younger children with their learning and routines. Children have many opportunities to develop their creativity and physical skills in the thoughtfully-presented environment.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of children and families. They build effective, responsive relationships with families to promote meaningful connections between home and the centre. Teachers regularly involve parents with setting goals for their child‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Teachers purposefully extend children‚Äôs creativity and oral language skills. They provide a wide range of activities in the well-resourced, spacious environment. Teachers create meaningful wall displays to accurately record children‚Äôs interests and involvement in the learning programme.</p><p>Transition into the centre is well managed to meet the needs of children and families. Teachers have a positive relationship with the two local schools and share ideas about play-based learning with the new entrant teachers. Teachers intentionally support the development of children‚Äôs independence and self-help skills to foster their successful transition to school.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about children‚Äôs learning through learning stories and discussions with staff. They are regularly invited to share their ideas and become involved in decision-making processes at the centre.</p><p>Teachers benefit from appropriate opportunities to take responsibility for centre tasks and processes to build their leadership capability. They regularly participate in systematic appraisal processes and a relevant range of professional development that impacts positively on their practice.</p><p>The centre manager has developed a useful strategic plan with appropriate action plans to guide the operation of the centre. Self review is contributing to achieving centre priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and ERO agree that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue developing bicultural perspectives and use of te reo MƒÅori in assessment and the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation by increasing the focus on learning in group planning and reflecting children‚Äôs cultures in learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document appraisal procedures and guidelines in more detail.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunflowers Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunflowers Preschool Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>26 April 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
