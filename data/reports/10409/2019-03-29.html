</table><p>Springbank Pre School¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springbank Pre School is a well-established early childhood centre operating in the grounds of Springbank School. It provides education and care for 50 children, including a maximum of 15 children aged up to two years. The preschool is divided into two areas, each with its own playground and teaching team. The majority of children attending the preschool move on to Springbank Headstart, an early childhood centre for children aged from four-and-a-half to six years, which also operates as part of the wider Springbank school campus.</p><p>The centre is governed by Springbank Preschool Ltd, a family owned company. The principal of the Springbank School is the manager. He has oversight of the centre and provides support for centre leaders. The centre has seven qualified early childhood teachers and two support staff.</p><p>There have been significant changes in the centre since the 2015 ERO report. In addition to an extension of the building to cater for children under the age of two, there have been changes in the teaching and leadership teams.</p><p>The centre has maintained the positive features noted in the 2015 ERO report. Good progress has been made in addressing most of the key next steps identified in the 2015 ERO report. The centre continues to work on displaying the evolving programme planning in ways that engage children, parents and teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have access to a wide variety of curriculum experiences. They make choices about what they want to do and are able to play uninterrupted for extended periods. They are familiar with the expectations of mat times and meal times. Children are confident in this environment. They play cooperatively and develop respectful, caring relationships with their peers and teachers. They are well supported to develop as competent learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from an individualised approach to their care and learning. Designated teachers support each child's settling and transitions, and undertake personal care tasks for that child. These very young children are well supported to explore the environment and to develop at their own pace. The well-paced transition of two-year-olds to join the older children allows them time to build their confidence in their new environment.</p><p>The programme for older children is responsive to their interests, parents' aspirations and teachers' ideas. It is underpinned by a framework of annual events and celebrations. There are rich opportunities for children to explore their local surroundings and participate in excursions into the wider community. Regular forest walks in the school grounds reinforce children's developing understanding of the natural world. Parents and whƒÅnau are encouraged to become involved in the programme and their contributions are appreciated.</p><p>Teachers provide very good support for children's learning. Noteworthy aspects of teachers' practice include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>knowing children well, respecting their individual preferences, and fostering their independence and self-help skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reinforcing links with children's families and wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently respectful interactions with children and very good support for their oral language development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working collaboratively to ensure children are well supported and their emotional and physical needs met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seamlessly integrating te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in their daily practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre is an integral part of the wider school campus. Well-articulated, shared values underpin the culture of both the school and preschool. There is an emphasis on providing a strong family oriented environment and developing children's capability, character and confidence. These qualities are evident in day-to-day centre operations and set the tone for how children learn.</p><p>The manager and centre leaders work collaboratively to guide and develop centre practices. They listen to teachers' ideas and provide opportunities for teachers to contribute and take leadership in their areas of interest. Centre operations are underpinned by a sound framework of policies, systems and processes. Some of these centre documents and processes have been recently introduced or modified and are still to be fully embedded.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the focus on outcomes for children, particularly in the implementation of internal evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that programme planning is more visible in the environment, to further promote parent and child contributions, and opportunities for children to revisit and lead their own learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springbank Pre School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>29 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
