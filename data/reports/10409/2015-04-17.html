</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springbank Pre School provides full day education and care for up to 40 children from two to five years of age. It is one of two licensed early childhood centres that operate on the same site, shared with Springbank School. The centre operates under the governance of the Springbank School Board of Trustees. The same administrative and management systems serve both centres. Recently there has been a significant change in staff in the preschool. The head teacher places priority on building a professional teaching team.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy, inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy, promotes child-centred learning and learning through active exploration. The philosophy aims for children to be supported to learn through ‚Äòreciprocal relationships with people, places and things‚Äô. Children benefit from a wide range of opportunities to explore and use the grounds and facilities of the adjoining school.</p><p>Positive features noted ERO‚Äôs 2012 report remain evident. For example, children continue to enjoy good relationships with each other and teachers regard children as capable learners. The ERO report also endorsed the centre‚Äôs priorities to enhance bicultural and multicultural practices, and to continue strengthening partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau. Good progress has been made to improve the outdoor environment and further develop planning and assessment of children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is evident in teaching practice and children‚Äôs play. Children benefit from individualised and responsive teaching. Teachers are skilled at encouraging children‚Äôs exploration and engagement in learning. They support children to make independent choices and plan their play.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô inclusive approaches ensure that all children participate in the programme. Children enjoy positive respectful relationships with adults and each other. They are listened to and valued by teachers. As a result, children confidently begin conversations and engage in cooperative play with their peers and adults.</p><p>Children‚Äôs transitions into and from the preschool are well supported. They have good opportunities to familiarise themselves with new staff and settings. This gives them confidence as they take their next steps in their education journey.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and strengths. Good planning and assessment practices underpin the programme. Planning approaches are flexible, and individualised. Teachers cater for diversity and children‚Äôs emerging interests. Planning is well documented and evaluated. Parents‚Äô contributions to planning for their child‚Äôs learning are a feature of the preschool.</p><p>The learning environment is well resourced. Teachers adapt and change it in response to children‚Äôs evolving interests. Children have ready access to an outdoor area. This area has been developed to offer children choice from a variety of engaging activities.</p><p>Maori children‚Äôs cultural identity is affirmed and their sense of belonging and connectedness is well supported. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are integrated into the programme, environment and centre practices. Teachers are committed to continuing to build upon their current good practice to foster success for Maori children. They are supporting children to learn about our bicultural society.</p><p>Effective leadership is contributing to the good quality care and education for children in the centre. The knowledgeable and professional head teacher‚Äôs practice reflects the centre philosophy. She is encouraging the new teaching team to collaboratively use their complementary skills and interests in the centre programme.</p><p>The board continues to provide appropriate administrative, personnel and support systems to underpin centre operations. Review of these processes is aided by regular management meetings with campus managers. Teacher performance is annually appraised by the school principal. He acknowledges the value of including the head teacher more in the appraisal of teachers in the preschool.</p><p>Teachers benefit from professional relationships with staff from across the campus. Relevant professional learning supports them to reflect on and develop their practice. Self review is a feature of teachers‚Äô daily practice. Consideration is given to how their practices, programmes and resources can be modified to offer better outcomes for children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>further acknowledging children‚Äôs culture, language and identity in their assessment portfolios</li>
<li>displaying the evolving programme focus areas in ways that engage children, parents and teachers</li>
<li>planning strategically for continued development in the outdoor environment to offer children more options for physical challenge.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springbank Pre School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, safe fall should be provided for all activities that children engage in where they are more than one metre off the ground.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Springbank Pre School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
