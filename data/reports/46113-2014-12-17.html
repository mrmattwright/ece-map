</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy The Bay is located in the residential area of Welcome Bay, Tauranga. Since January 2014, the centre has been governed by the Kidicorp Corporation. The centre provides both sessional and full day education and care for 40 children, from two years to school age in a mixed-age setting. At the time of this ERO review the roll had increased to 38 children, 12 of whom are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self-review and quality assurance processes, as well as professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel. These services are underpinned by its clear vision and values.</p><p>The newly appointed centre manager is well supported in this new role by the professional services and business managers. There have been a number of changes to the teaching team since the centre opened. Currently, there are three qualified teachers and one teacher in training.</p><p>The centre philosophy is to provide an environment that fosters independence, empowerment, respect and natural discoveries. Children are given opportunities for freedom of choice where they develop self-discipline, independence and the foundation skills which will prepare each individual to 'be school ready' and lifelong learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are calm and settled. They learn in a stimulating safe and secure environment. The centre programme is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and strengths, and consideration is given to parents‚Äô aspirations. The programme is enhanced by trips into the local and wider community. In a short time, the teachers have established a culture that includes regular events and celebrations with whƒÅnau and the wider community.</p><p>The aesthetically attractive and spacious indoor and outdoor environments provide children with many opportunities to learn about natural science and the living world. Children are able to explore and experiment with a good variety of equipment and materials that support them to express themselves creatively and build their understanding of the natural world.</p><p>The <em>Be School Ready</em> approach sets clear expectations for the development of parent and community partnerships, teaching practice and the promotion of literacy and numeracy. The centre manager and team have developed this approach and made it specific to the areas of play. A useful next step is to ensure that these documented expectations are consistently implemented and monitored by staff.</p><p>Children are building their social skills as they work alongside each other in this mixed-age setting. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and benefit from the nurturing and positive relationships with teachers. Teachers plan, document and display attractive learning examples and the centre programme for children to revisit and share with their families. The introduction of e-portfolios has enhanced parent centre learning partnerships.</p><p>The centre manager has worked successfully to build a positive team culture and establish new relationships in the community. She models good teaching practice and teachers expressed appreciation for her open and shared leadership style.</p><p>ERO observed some models of good teaching practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>open-ended questions and learning conversations</li>
<li>supporting children to learn self management and life skills</li>
<li>using intentional teaching strategies to extend children‚Äôs thinking and learning</li>
<li>integrating early concepts of mathematics and literacy throughout the programme</li>
<li>establishing positive relationships amongst teachers, children and families.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified and ERO agrees that important areas for continuing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>embed self-review practices and processes</li>
<li>ensure teachers consistently link planning and assessment to parents aspirations</li>
<li>build partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau</li>
<li>learn about local history of iwi and hapu</li>
<li>identify and document children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity</li>
<li>strengthen routines that are flexible and responsive to children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Community Kindy The Bay completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy The Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
