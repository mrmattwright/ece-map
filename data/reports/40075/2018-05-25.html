</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Seedlings Preschool is a privately owned, purpose-built, full-day education and care centre, which is licensed for 58 children including 12 under two years old. The centre is located in a rural, farm-based setting between Edgecumbe and Awakeri. It caters for children from birth to school age in three age-based play rooms. Children of all ages share a large outdoor playground, which includes a designated space for infants. The roll of 80 children includes 14 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO report, centre ownership has changed, the centre leader has remained in her position and two team leaders have been appointed. There have been staff changes and a significant proportion of teachers have extended their qualifications in early childhood education. Teachers have engaged in a range of professional development opportunities and there has been extensive review and revision of centre policies and procedures.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is to promote play-based learning with a connection to the natural world. Teachers respect the uniqueness of each child and promote their holistic growth and development. Their mission is to 'nourish our seeds to grow as life-long learners with positive mind and grit'.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children of all ages benefit from respectful, inclusive teaching practices. Interactions between teachers and children are warm and caring. Children are encouraged to have fun and enjoy their learning and play. Regularly reviewed routines provide structure for daily activities, fostering a strong sense of belonging and providing opportunities for children to contribute to the programme. Teachers develop children's oral language through continual discussion about their learning experiences. An intentional emphasis on developing children‚Äôs social skills has enhanced their friendships and positive relationships. Collaborative play is strongly evident.</p><p>The curriculum reflects the centre‚Äôs philosophy. The child-led programme is based on recognition of children‚Äôs strengths, interests and preferences and is strongly influenced by the expansive natural environment. The programme incorporates parents' suggestions, reflects current events and uses teachers‚Äô personal strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori, waiata, karakia and MƒÅori stories are integrated into the programme along with the development of early literacy, numeracy, science and music skills. Recent focuses on incorporating 'next steps' within learning stories and building bicultural perspectives are adding complexity and meaning to children's individual assessments and planning. Teachers promote children's holistic development, build on their strengths and capabilities, and encourage them to become life-long learners.</p><p>Stimulating learning environments encourage children's learning, wondering and creativity. The high quality outdoor area provides children with a wide range of rich learning experiences. Established, spacious, naturally landscaped outdoor spaces include physical challenges, natural resources, a wharenui, a swimming pool, and access to farm animals, orchards and forest trees. Outdoor play areas also promote literacy, numeracy, construction and social play. Indoor play areas make learning visible in wall displays and provide children with ready access to interesting creative resources. Children readily sustain engagement in learning and play throughout the day.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive consistent and responsive care. A high teacher-to-child ratio and the employment of full-time teachers contribute to a consistent and respectful approach to young children‚Äôs individual needs, rhythms and routines. Teachers maintain calm, uncluttered learning environments and respond respectfully to children‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues. Songs, including waiata, and rhymes contribute to oral language development. The environment includes opportunities for sensory stimulation and is well resourced for children to select equipment and activities of their choice. There is an easy flow between playrooms for siblings and friends. Parents have daily opportunities to communicate and discuss matters relating to their children's learning and development. Infants and toddlers are becoming capable and confident communicators and explorers.</p><p>Children with diverse and additional needs are very well integrated into the programme. Their individual requirements are addressed naturally. Centre staff work well with parents and external agencies to minimise barriers to learning. Successes are shared and celebrated. It is evident that these children enjoy their daily learning experiences.</p><p>The centre leader demonstrates strong professional leadership and works collaboratively with owners/directors and team leaders. Together they have revised the centre‚Äôs core values, philosophy and strategic direction, which include a strong emphasis on working with parents and the local community. Centre leaders model effective teaching practices and promote a shared leadership approach. Internal evaluation processes have been strengthened to align with strategic, annual and appraisal goals. Centre leaders have established smooth transition processes into and within the centre. Teachers are continually reviewing and refining practices that assist children's transition to school. Effective leadership practices facilitate positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre owners and leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop centre-wide appraisal systems and processes, and consider providing an external appraiser for the centre leader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the centre's bicultural practices including regular consultation with MƒÅori whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that parents and children have intentional opportunities to contribute to individual assessment and planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Seedlings Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Seedlings Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>25 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
