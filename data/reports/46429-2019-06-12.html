</table><p>Red Robin Nanny Agency Ltd¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Red Robin Nanny Agency Ltd is a home-based education and care service established in 2014 and licensed for 80 children. Educators that are nannies and au pairs in the wider Auckland area look after children in the child's own home. The service provides professional development for educators and administration services. Many of the educators have undertaken an early childhood course or qualification.</p><p>The service's philosophy is that children learn best in a home environment where they are supported by whƒÅnau, educators and community.</p><p>The service directors are responsible for overall governance and management. They work with an education manager, visiting teachers and a recruiter. The service directors have developed management and administration systems that align with the service's philosophy and vision.</p><p>Registered teachers visit educators at least monthly. They provide strategies and guidance for the care and education of infants, toddlers and older children, as well as monitoring provision for children's health and safety. Children, parents and educators can participate in playgroups and events that provide opportunities for children to learn in large group situations. They are also involved in frequent community excursions.</p><p>This service was last reviewed by ERO in 2017 as Red Robin Homebased Childcare. ERO's report noted strong relationships with families and educators. ERO identified areas for development in relation to curriculum, management practices and health and safety. Service leaders have worked with the Ministry of Education to improve practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning records show that they participate in planned experiences, day-to-day household tasks and regular outings in the community. These experiences include early literacy, mathematics and science, and the use of creative and manipulative materials. There is a strong focus on oral language and encouraging children to explore and engage in meaningful conversations.</p><p>Educators promote learning through planned and spontaneous play experiences. Children have fun, make choices and are confident in their surroundings. Their sense of belonging is affirmed and their emotional development is fostered.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing individualised care. Educators know the children in their care very well and respond quickly to their feelings, ideas and care needs. They maintain good hygiene and safety practices, and are supported by visiting teachers' regular health and safety checks.</p><p>Educators keep good records of each child‚Äôs day in learning journals that help them to share the child‚Äôs routines and development with parents. Parents may contribute to these journals. They are also well informed about the service through regular contact by email, an online platform and social media.</p><p>Visiting teachers encourage educators to incorporate te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children. Professional development will help visiting teachers and educators to strengthen their implementation of a bicultural curriculum that incorporates MƒÅori language and values.</p><p>The visiting teachers provide good support for educators in their dual roles of educator and carer. They support educators' understanding of children's development and learning, and how these link to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Visiting teachers could strengthen evidence of how they support educators to extend children's interests.</p><p>Directors and visiting teachers work collaboratively with educators and parents. The service supports parents to employ an educator who is the best match for their family. There are sound recruitment processes in place, including induction for new educators and parents. Visiting teachers and recruiters ensure that educators are familiar with the service's expectations, and understand their legal obligations in providing education and care in the family home.</p><p>Service operations include a comprehensive range of policies and processes. The service directors have a strong commitment to continuous improvement. Regular health and safety monitoring provides assurance that service expectations are being met. Purposeful internal evaluation has been established, and is supporting service leaders to review practices and target areas to further develop.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders agree that key next steps for the service include leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving records of how coordinators coach and guide educator practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly evaluating improvements in teaching practices and their impact on children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating how effectively responses to individual children's interests and dispositions are planned for and extended.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for visiting teachers are to build on educators' capability to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use assessment, planning and evaluation to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning how they will respond to children‚Äôs individual emerging interests, dispositions, parent aspirations, and showing children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporating te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in daily programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Red Robin Nanny Agency Ltd completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>12 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
