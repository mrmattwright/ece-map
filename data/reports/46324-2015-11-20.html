</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Educare, in the Auckland suburb of Mangere, is a newly opened, purpose built centre licensed in 2014. The privately owned centre provides education and care for 30 children, including up to 5 children under two years of age. It has a separate room for babies and toddlers.</p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO report. A good set of policies and procedures guide centre practices. There are well established relationships with the local primary school who shares the centre’s philosophy for its largely Muslim community. The centre director works closely with the centre manager to lead and manage the centre’s daily operations.</p><p>The manager works collaboratively with the head teacher, teachers and cook to provide services for the multi-cultural community. Four teachers are qualified and a student teacher is being mentored to gain qualifications. Team building has been a focus to support staff and establish positive relationships as children and whānau settle into the centre. Teachers relate well to children and their whānau.</p><p>The majority of the children are Indian and this is a centre of choice for the predominantly Muslim families. The centre’s philosophy promotes children’s learning and is closely linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre’s vision is to integrate the strands and principles of <em>Te Whāriki </em>with Islamic values, principles and practices. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is respected as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and supports centre staff to develop a bicultural curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a sense of belonging in the centre. They are articulate and initiate conversations with adults and each other. Their cultural identity is valued and they relate well to teachers who reflect the ethnic diversity of the centre community. Children also relate well to each other and play on their own and in small groups. They independently choose from the indoor and outdoor activities that are provided.</p><p>The centre environment promotes the cultures of children and teachers, and resources support the centre’s learning programme. Displays are mostly at children’s level and celebrate play experiences. Science, literacy, numeracy, technology and sustainability are evident in the programme.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and support each other. They are inclusive and know children and their families well. Teachers promote children’s first language. They value te reo Māori and are strengthening ways to reflect tikanga Māori in the programme.</p><p>Parents are invited to participate and share their knowledge. A growing number of them offer their skills to enhance the programme, including support for administration systems. Families have many opportunities to give feedback, share their aspirations and make comments to support improvements. Teachers could now consider ways to strengthen this partnership to further promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Portfolios are an attractive record of children’s learning. Teachers encourage parent to contribute to these records. Teachers should review how effectively these document show children’s learning over time.</p><p>Teachers are encouraged to participate in professional learning and use both formal and informal opportunities to discuss and think about their practice. They are supported to build their leadership capability. Teachers identify personal goals and are well supported to achieve these. They now need to strengthen the culture of inquiry and reflection about their practice through more robust self-review processes.</p><p>The centre manager relates very well to her staff and community. She has worked effectively to successfully meet the Ministry of Education’s licensing criteria. There are good systems in place that guide centre operations. It could be useful to document long term goals to more clearly identify guide and evaluate the centre’s strategic direction. The owner/director’s input into the centre supports the manager and teachers to provide for the growing demand for this service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that ongoing evaluation of the programme should help to ensure that it:</p><ul>
<li>supports children’s transition to, through and from the centre</li>
<li>continues to provide opportunities to extend children’s understanding of literacy, mathematics, science and technology and supports their physical learning development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderland Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinderland Educare will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 November 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
