</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>YMCA Early Learning Centre is a full-day education and care centre in central Invercargill. It caters for up to 35 children aged from birth to school age. Infants, toddlers, and older children each have their own rooms at the centre. All the children play in the same space at the start and end of the day, and they share the outside playground.¬†</p>
<p>The centre is owned by Southland YMCA Education Ltd. The YMCA organisation supports the management of the centre. A manager and head teacher have responsibility for the day-to-day running of the centre. The centre has a high proportion of qualified staff.</p>
<p>The centre leaders have made significant progress on all the recommendations identified in the 2013 ERO report. This report recommends that they continue to develop these areas.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children benefit from caring, respectful, and trusting relationships with their teachers. They play and learn in a very settled and secure atmosphere. Children and teachers have genuine conversations. Teachers listen carefully to the children and give them time to respond. The low adult-to-child ratios in the infant and toddler rooms strongly support these aspects.¬†</p>
<p>The teachers provide a rich range of purposeful learning experiences for the children. For example, as part of the well-established ‚Äúbush programme‚Äù older children visit the Otatara Scenic Reserve every week. Children go on frequent excursions in the local community, including to regular gym sessions. The programme also has an emphasis on early literacy and mathematics learning.</p>
<p>The leaders and teachers have a shared understanding of the centre‚Äôs philosophy and values. The philosophy is visible in action in the way children help make decisions about the programme and take on real tasks around the centre. In the older children‚Äôs room teachers and children plan and work on extended projects together.</p>
<p>The leaders and teachers go out of their way to support the participation and wellbeing of all the children at the centre. They:</p>
<ul><li>provide a van to pick up children from families who find it hard to get to the centre</li>
<li>work closely with other agencies who can support children and their parents</li>
<li>adapt their programme to fully include children with diverse needs</li>
<li>communicate with parents in both formal and informal ways.</li>
</ul><p>The programme values and affirms the children‚Äôs home cultures. The teachers maintain MƒÅori children‚Äôs connections to their cultural identity through frequent reading and telling of traditional stories, taking part in Polyfest, using waiata and karakia, and developing interesting wall displays. There has also been a recent emphasis on Samoan culture and language.¬†</p>
<p>The teachers have a useful format for planning for individual children‚Äôs learning. They incorporate parents‚Äô wishes for their children in the planning. Teachers assemble attractive records of children‚Äôs learning. These show the wide variety of experiences children have and include evidence around their individual goals. Next steps in this area are for teachers to:</p>
<ul><li>ensure they understand and apply the planning format consistently</li>
<li>show more clearly how they are making a difference for children.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers should put a system in place to check that individual children‚Äôs learning is discussed regularly with all parents.</p>
<h3>Governance and leadership</h3>
<p>The centre leaders have developed a useful strategic plan that sets out priorities for the centre and gives guidance for future action. The plan will be even more useful with clearer monitoring of the goals and reporting to the YMCA governing board.</p>
<p>Teachers‚Äô use of self review and ongoing professional development has led to positive changes at the centre. Asking more evaluative questions in the planned reviews will help the centre leaders and YMCA board be assured about the quality of their work. The appraisal system for staff members should be consolidated and would benefit from a formal observation component.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The key next steps for the centre leaders are to improve the systems for monitoring aspects of the centre‚Äôs operations, and sharing best practice throughout the centre. This should include:</p>
<ul><li>enhancing consistency in planning for and recording children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>consolidating the appraisal system</li>
<li>checking for and dealing with hazards.</li>
</ul><p>The YMCA governing board should ensure it receives better information to inform it about the progress and performance of the centre.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of YMCA Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p>

<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
