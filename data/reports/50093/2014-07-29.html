</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids South Road, in Hawera, is one of two centres owned and managed by Kidicorp. It is an all day service catering for children aged up to three and a half years. Many move on to Topkids South Road Preschool, located nearby, at approximately three and a half years of age.</p><p>A number of changes to staffing have occurred since the June 2011 ERO report. Many are beginning teachers being supported to meet full teacher registration status. Centre leaders work collaboratively to guide programmes and teaching practice.</p><p>A shared philosophy underpins respectful interactions and continuity of learning within the centre. Kidicorp provides staff with clear policies and guidelines for the care and education of children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A positive tone and inclusive practice prevails in the centre. Teachers are respectful and affirming with children. Constructive interactions support children‚Äôs wellbeing and provide a positive platform for active exploration and learning.</p><p>Programmes of learning reflect the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. The philosophy is based on developing trust, respect, empathy and compassion in children. This expression is the result of staff, parents, whƒÅnau and NgƒÅti Ruanui aspirations held for children. This unified approach, kotahitanga, is captured in the centre whakatauki: He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tamariki! He tamariki! He tamariki!.</p><p>The child-focused, thoughtfully planned and regularly reviewed environment effectively supports children‚Äôs holistic development. Infants, toddlers and young children engage in a varied range of inviting activities and group learning experiences based on their interests. Adults foster all children‚Äôs emotional and social competence.</p><p>The service‚Äôs youngest children are very well catered for by specific teachers who astutely recognise their cues and desires. These infants and toddlers experience an unhurried approach and nurturing care routines. They explore the appropriate range of play equipment and activities available at their own pace.</p><p>Transitions within the centre are well considered. They are determined by the child's readiness, and in consultation with families and whƒÅnau. Children‚Äôs early literacy and mathematical learning is promoted through play-based experiences.</p><p>The use of Kidicorp's improvement focused systems builds the capability of leaders and teachers. Sustainable practice focuses on improving outcomes for children. Staff at Topkids are highly reflective and collaborative practitioners. The service‚Äôs self review identifies ongoing priorities to deepen teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The 2011 ERO review identified further developing planning and assessment practices as a next step. Professional development and learning is underway to address this. ERO‚Äôs evaluation affirms this as a continuing priority to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Self review of the centre philosophy has had positive outcomes for children. It is now timely to review other priority areas of the curriculum. Leaders should strategically plan for and further develop self-review to determine the successful practices that:</p><ul>
<li>uphold MƒÅori learners‚Äô culture, language and identity more effectively through the curriculum and teaching practice</li>
<li>support progressive literacy and mathematical learning for all children.</li>
</ul><p>Developments should inform relevant changes to the centre‚Äôs curriculum expectations and include clear indicators and measurable outcomes for teaching practice to show how success will be reviewed.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids South Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Topkids South Road will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>29 July 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
