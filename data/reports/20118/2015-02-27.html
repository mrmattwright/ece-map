</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Northcote Baptist Community Preschool is a well established service administered by the Northcote Baptist Community Trust, which is a not-for-profit organisation. Strong Christian beliefs and teaching principles underpin the centre philosophy and curriculum. The multicultural centre is reflective of its community.</p><p>The preschool caters for up to fifty children within three rooms that are organised to cater for differing age groups. They include a nursery for infants and toddlers up to two years of age, and two preschool rooms for older children. The nursery has its own outdoor space with access to, and a view of, the larger outdoor environment. All other children share a newly developed outside play area.</p><p>The preschool provides a well qualified, long serving teaching team. Since the 2012 ERO review, teachers‚Äô professional development has been strengthened and aligned more closely to the centre‚Äôs philosophy. Positive relationships with local primary schools and strategies to support children‚Äôs transition to school continue to be a feature of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and enthusiastically engage in the programme. They have well established relationships with teachers and their peers. Children are encouraged to be independent explorers and make discoveries from a very good range of readily accessible resources. They select activities that interest them and collaborate with others as they play. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments and frequently engage in play that supports their development.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience responsive and trusting relationships with teachers who ensure their daily needs are met with care and sensitivity. Calm and affirming staff help younger children to feel relaxed and secure. High adult-to-child ratios provide additional opportunities for younger children to receive individual support as they explore their surroundings.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They show a strong commitment to recognising children‚Äôs individual strengths, knowledge and family aspirations. The programmes they plan and implement are well developed and responsive to children‚Äôs identified interests and abilities. These programmes provide a sound platform for children‚Äôs transitions within the centre and to school.</p><p>Assessment portfolios provide very good information about children‚Äôs involvement in the programme. Effective use of communications technology allows families to have instant access to their children‚Äôs learning and assessment. Increasingly, parents are accessing this information and contributing to their child‚Äôs learning stories.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value children‚Äôs diverse cultures, languages and identities in different ways throughout the programme. Children have many opportunities to celebrate their own and each others‚Äô cultures. Teachers are committed to providing a programme that reflects New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage and supports MƒÅori children to succeed as MƒÅori. They begin each day with a whƒÅnau time and use te reo MƒÅori routinely throughout the day.</p><p>Teachers are focussed on self improvement and benefit from strong professional leadership. Topics for teacher development are identified as part of their performance appraisal, and they continue to develop their teaching practices through shared professional development. Teachers communicate well and receive good support from centre leaders to take shared responsibility for children‚Äôs learning and development. The Ministry of Education resource, TƒÅtaiako, could now be helpful to enhance bicultural teaching practices.</p><p>The centre is very well managed. Respectful and professional relationships underpin the working partnership between centre managers and trustees who take responsibility for centre governance. Managers are strategic in their appointment of staff.</p><p>Self review is systematic and well documented. Centre leaders have a strong focus on continuing improvement through self review in order to guide significant development for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop teachers‚Äô bicultural practice</li>
<li>considering ways to further extend older children‚Äôs thinking and learning</li>
<li>strengthening children‚Äôs input into curriculum planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Northcote Baptist Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Northcote Baptist Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
