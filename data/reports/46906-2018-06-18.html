</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peachgrove Prep School is a newly established, purpose-built early childhood service located in Hamilton East. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 95 children including 18 children up to the age of two years. The roll at the time of this ERO report was 107 children including 45 MƒÅori. There are four indoor, age-based areas with two shared spaces for outdoor play.</p><p>The centre owner is also the director with overall responsibility for governance. The centre manager oversees professional leadership and curriculum. Team leaders are responsible for the day-to-day organisation of the age-based areas.</p><p>A high proportion of staff are registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy places value on respect, relationships, diversity, environment, qualified teachers and school readiness.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre governance and leadership have effectively established a positive, supportive and inclusive culture for children, families and staff. The centre philosophy is clearly documented and was recently reviewed to reflect the values of teaching staff and parent priorities. Policies and procedures are in place to guide centre practice. The annual plan sets clear expectations for teachers' roles and responsibilities. Leaders have attended professional development and implemented a useful framework to guide self review. Implementing a strategic approach to self review is necessary for ongoing centre improvement.</p><p>Teachers are provided with relevant and ongoing professional development opportunities. They would benefit from further documented feedback from leaders to build their practice. Leaders need to further develop the local curriculum and implement the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. A particular strength of the centre is the collegial and collaborative leadership model. This is contributing to supporting a sustainable service for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of implementing a child-led approach to programme planning and curriculum. Children are benefitting from opportunities to make choices about their play. Routines are flexible to respond to individual needs and enable children to sustain their learning and play. Teachers are responding to the observed dispositions of individual children to support progress and development. Learning is made visible for families and children through attractive centre displays, digital and in-centre portfolios that are accessible to children. Digital portfolios contain parent voice and contributions to learning stories that support the learning partnership between teachers and families/whƒÅnau. Children participate in trips and excursions, regular celebrations and festivals related to their nationalities and ethnicities. Parents are able to attend regular evenings to share kai, talk about children's learning and participate in topics of interest such as health and child development. Leaders and teachers are continuing to strengthen formal opportunities for parents to share their aspirations and set goals for their children in a productive learning partnership. These inclusive practices are contributing to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and families.</p><p>Positive teaching strategies observed by ERO were:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>responding to the diverse needs of children and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting children's developing social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conversations with children to build their language and communication skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>affirming children's successes and acknowledging their contributions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planned activities to support children's emerging literacy and mathematics concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Transitions into the centre, across the age-based rooms and on to school are well planned and managed at each child's own pace. Teachers work positively with specialist agencies and families to provide inclusive care for learners with additional needs.</p><p>MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau benefit from teachers who are knowledgeable about their culture. There is respect for tikanga in the centre, including karakia, waiata, use of te reo MƒÅori and resources that reflect MƒÅori cultural values. It is now important to build the understanding of all teachers about culturally responsive practices that promote success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</p><p>Children of Pacific Island descent benefit from teachers and families sharing cultural information, engaging with equipment that reflects their values, visual displays and using familiar phrases from their cultures.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years old experience nurturing and responsive care. Families and teachers maintain close communication about the care and learning for these young children. Teachers consistently use calm, unhurried practices and a primary care approach. Infants and toddlers are able to explore and experiment in a secure and attractive environment. They have regular opportunities to play with older children and siblings. These strategies are contributing to confident and settled children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Important next steps to improve practice are for the centre owner to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement a strategic approach to self review in order to sustain ongoing centre development and improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process to improve and maintain effective teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide ongoing professional development for teachers to support them in implementing the revised <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> and a local curriculum for the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build the consistency of practice across the centre to respond to the language, culture and identity of each child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their understanding of assessment processes that are responsive to MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the engagement of families in the learning partnership.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peachgrove Prep Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should implement rigorous systems and processes for ensuring health and safety regulations are consistently met.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Peachgrove Prep Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>18 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
