</table><p>Kidditech Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidditech Early Learning Centre is a small centre catering for children over two years to school age. It is a privately owned family business and operates out of a refurbished villa that has been thoughtfully developed for young children. The owners are actively involved in the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises learning through science and technology. Programmes are based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there has been a restructure of management roles and responsibilities. One of the owners is now the centre and curriculum leader. All permanent teachers are ECE qualified and registered.</p><p>The owners have responded positively to the areas for review and development identified in the 2013 ERO report. These included appraisal, curriculum leadership, partnership with parents, long-term planning, cultural responsiveness and self review. They have made significant progress with many of these and are continuing to strengthen others.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre leaders and teachers provide a welcoming, inclusive, family-like environment for children. They know children and their families well. Teachers are responsive to children's learning and wellbeing needs.</p><p>Children play well together and learn from one another in mixed age settings. Tuakana teina relationships are evident in the way children involve others in their play. Many caring and respectful relationships are evident among children and with their teachers. </p><p>Parents' views, opinions and involvement are valued. Teachers have strengthened the process they use to gather and use parents' aspirations for their children in planning learning programmes.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is reflected in the curriculum where there is a strong emphasis on science and technology.</p><p>Children's ideas are sought, valued and influence the direction of their learning. Their knowledge and critical thinking skills are extended through the wide range of interesting learning opportunities made available to them. Children show interest and remain engaged in discovery and learning for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Children benefit from an interesting range of learning experiences within the centre and local community. They regularly learn about caring for the environment and healthy eating. They have many opportunities to learn in the wider community. Centre leaders and teachers have developed many positive, reciprocal relationships in the local neighbourhood.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers respond positively to children with special learning needs. Teachers are ably supporting a number of children, who are fluent speakers of other languages, to learn English.</p><p>Leaders and teachers effectively promote the interests and wellbeing of children. They have a shared understanding of the centre's vision and values. Teachers are supported to grow their leadership capability. They benefit from a useful appraisal process that encourages them to reflect on their teaching and improve teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The owners have strengthened governance and management of the centre. They have streamlined systems through the effective use of digital technology. The owners are proactive in seeking, and making good use of, external professional support. A recent strategic focus on building strong relationships and better ways of communicating has been effective and well received.</p><p>There are high levels of parent satisfaction with the service. The owners respond to feedback in positive, and often creative, ways. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders' and teachers' next steps to improve outcomes for children are to strengthen planning and assessment practices by:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build teachers' knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori and reflect this in children's planning, programmes and assessment</li>
<li>placing greater emphasis on the culture, language and identity of children's home cultures</li>
<li>making teaching strategies and evaluation more visible in planning and assessment, particularly for individuals</li>
<li>being more specific in planning and assessment about individual children's strengths, interests, needs and next learning steps</li>
<li>ensuring children's privacy is protected.</li>
</ul><p>While, considerable work has been done to build teacher's self-review capacity this would be further strengthened by making self reviews more evaluative.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidditech Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Compliance Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders further develop risk analysis and management plans for all excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidditech Early Learning Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 September 2016</p><h3>Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
