</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pinegrove Kindergarten is part of the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (NTKA). The kindergarten provides for the education and care of up to 44 children, aged from two-to-five years. It is located in Brightwater, close to the local school. The association offers up to 30 free hours to support children's participation in early childhood education. It also provides a range of external expertise to help all children succeed in their learning. This includes te ao MƒÅori expertise, teacher aides, speech-language therapist, whƒÅnau support and parent-education opportunities.</p><p>The head teacher and teaching team are responsible for daily operations and the teaching programme. All teachers are fully qualified. Two teacher aides provide support for the children and teachers, to help meet identified areas of need. An active parent group leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing and improvements to the kindergarten.</p><p>The NTKA, including a chief executive officer and board, is responsible for the governance of the kindergarten. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversees and supports the professional practice of the teaching team.</p><p>There have been some changes to the teaching team, including two new appointments in 2018. Good progress has been made in addressing the recommendations in ERO's 2013 report and the good practices identified in that report have been sustained.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have high expectations for all children to be successful learners. They aim for children at Pinegrove Kindergarten to 'develop positive attitudes towards becoming independent, capable, competent, life-long learners and communicators'. These aims are enabled through teachers providing a rich curriculum and real-life contexts for learning, based on well-embedded local priorities. For example a well-established environmental programme helps children to learn to care for themselves and the world around them.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement interesting and well-resourced environments and programmes to meet the needs and interests of individual and groups of children. They:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use well-considered strategies to support children who need additional assistance with their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take a consistent approach to empower all children to have the skills to relate well to one another, develop a sense of belonging, and be actively involved in making decisions about their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use their knowledge of the children's and their families' strengths and interests to provide interesting and engaging experiences to build on and extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide many opportunities for children to hear and use te reo MƒÅori and gain knowledge of tikanga MƒÅori and te ao MƒÅori perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A strength in the kindergarten is the way teachers develop close, collaborative partnerships for learning with families and whƒÅnau. They regularly seek parents' wishes for their children's learning and work together with them to enable children to be successful. These close relationships enable MƒÅori whƒÅnau to know that their culture and heritage are highly valued.</p><p>Children's learning benefits from effective systems and processes for assessment, planning and evaluation. Internal-evaluation processes are used well to make changes and improvements to programmes and practices that provide positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Leadership fosters a culture of collaboration and reflective practice. The team makes good use of professional development to grow its capability and develop shared understandings of effective practice.</p><p>Managers and leaders have proactively addressed ERO‚Äôs recommendations for the association identified in previous reports. There is strong alignment between the NTKA strategic priorities and each kindergarten‚Äôs priorities and plans.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews, and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals.</p><p>The board and association managers are taking deliberate action to support MƒÅori and Pacific children, and children with diverse learning needs. NTKA leaders have developed strong networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Relevant professional-learning opportunities, improved teacher-appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the education advisors, are building leadership and teacher capability within the kindergartens.</p><p>A next step for association leaders and managers is to improve their planning to support the achievement of the board‚Äôs strategic objectives. This includes ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children.</p><p>The key next steps for the board are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explore ways to know more about how well children are achieving in relation to the association‚Äôs valued outcomes (vision and philosophy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the extent of improved outcomes for all children, and use these findings to inform decision making and the future direction of the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that the next steps are to make the priorities for children's learning at Pinegrove Kindergarten more evident in the philosophy and ensure that records of planning and assessment show how all children make progress towards these priorities.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers identified, and ERO agrees, that they could better document the evaluative discussions they have to show the shifts in teaching practice and the difference this makes to children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pinegrove Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pinegrove Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>12 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whƒÅnaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
