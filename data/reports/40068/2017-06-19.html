</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids - St Georges provides an all-day programme for children from infants to school age, and operates in two age-related rooms. The centre is licensed for 50 children with a maximum of 20 up to two years of age. The current roll of 56 includes seven Māori children.</p><p>The centre is community based and operates under the governing body of Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust Board (WASSTB). Since the last review the name has been changed from St Georges Education and Care Centre to show links with the other services within the organisation. A regional manager from the governing body WASSTB supports the centre manager in her role.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises whanaungatanga, diversity, relationships and contributions of whānau. Teachers seek to create 'a natural, safe and peaceful environment and base learning on interconnections with home, people, places and things'. As an Anglican Methodist Church based centre, they celebrate the unique presence of God and Christian values including love, hope, passion and integrity.</p><p>There are several long-standing staff members, including the manager and two team leaders. A high ratio of qualified teachers are employed but there is a current challenge in replacing the three teachers who have recently left. This has had significant impact on centre administration.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, there has been some progress in building the professional capacity of staff. There is still a need to strengthen the performance appraisal and development system for staff. The outdoor play area for older children has been completed and the upgrade of the infant and toddler outdoor area is currently in progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience an emergent curriculum that is effectively focussed on developing their interests and dispositions for learning. Christian values are effectively woven within the programme. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated in meaningful contexts. Trips into the local community are planned to extend children’s interests and are a feature of the centre. There are opportunities for whole group learning experiences relating to cultural and local events. Children benefit from an interesting, broad curriculum, which aims to develop foundational skills for life-long learning.</p><p>Māori children are well supported to achieve success. A bicultural programme is interwoven with karakia, himene, waiata and some te reo Māori being used daily. Teachers have a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and some have attended te reo Māori classes. Children learn about local legends and their mihi, and te ao Māori is visible within the environment. Māori children's language, culture and identity are celebrated and affirmed.</p><p>Knowledgeable and caring teachers form strong relationships with children and their families. Teachers scaffold children's learning through recognising, responding to, and extending their interests. They are inclusive and responsive to the diverse needs of children and their parents. Social competencies are skilfully supported and reciprocal, respectful interactions are evident. Children learn in spacious, attractive and well-resourced environments. They are well supported to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children experience well-planned transitions into and within the service. The centre is working hard to develop links with surrounding schools and are investigating how they can be involved with the local Community of Learning|Kāhui Ako. Children and their families develop a strong sense of trust and belonging.</p><p>The consistency of the long-standing, teaching team in the infants' and toddlers' area helps the youngest children to form attachments and settle. Teachers enact the Pikler philosophy where respectful relationships help nurture children and they value them as active, independent learners. Individual routines are well supported, and teachers and parents work in partnership for the benefit of the children. Infants and toddlers experience success as learners in a calm environment where their care needs are well met.</p><p>There are many opportunities for parents to engage in the curriculum. They value the knowledge that teachers share about their child's learning and development. Parents are encouraged to contribute to internal evaluation, and assessment and planning for their child.</p><p>Planning for individual children's learning is highly visible for parents. Portfolios capture parents' and children's voices, aspirations, dispositions for learning and interests to some degree. Teachers now need to regularly document children's learning and strengthen the assessment and planning process.</p><p>The long-standing leadership team, includes a centre manager who is well supported by two knowledgeable team leaders. The manager has participated in the recently established network of managers within the WASSTB. One of the team leaders has been supported by management and staff to work with the Ministry of Education and is now undertaking extra study. Leaders build teachers' capability through regular discussion, sharing professional knowledge and leading internal evaluation, both centre wide and within each room.</p><p>The centre has effective policies in place and now needs to ensure that these are enacted consistently and regularly reviewed. The strategic plan is strongly linked to that of the WASSTB. To further strengthen the plan, an annual plan showing clearer links to learning outcomes for children and more specific actions and timeframes should be put in place.</p><p>Teachers engage in both spontaneous and planned internal evaluation that brings about positive changes for centre management and the environment. It would be beneficial to include a review of the quality of learning outcomes for children. Leaders have identified that there is an urgent need to implement effective appraisal in line with the Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that priorities for the centre are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment to show continuity of learning and links to planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning to show clearer learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resourcing to enable leaders and teachers to effectively carry out their responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - St Georges completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that there is a system for regular appraisal in line with Education Council requirements. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em> </p><h3>ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiapu Kids - St Georges will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>19 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
