</table><p>The Nanny Company - Southern Two¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Nanny Company Limited (the company) is a privately owned, home-based education and care service. It operates five networks. Three networks, including this one (The Nanny Company Southern Two Limited), are located in Christchurch and two in Wellington. Children are educated and cared for in their own homes by nannies.</p><p>Some nannies in this network have early childhood qualifications. Some of them have been with the service for long periods of time. The director of the company is a qualified early childhood teacher. A qualified and certificated early childhood teacher (the visiting teacher) oversees the network and provides ongoing support for the nannies. An administration team is responsible for the daily operations.</p><p>The network has made good progress in addressing the recommendations of the December 2014 ERO report. The area of non-compliance relating to new nannies gaining a first aid qualification prior to commencing employment was immediately addressed. The service has a positive reporting with ERO.</p><p>This review is one of five homebased networks in The Nanny Company Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Company's vision is to ‚Äòenrich the lives of tamariki‚Äô through the education and care programmes provided by a nanny in the child's own home. This is supported by the director's high expectations for children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. With the leadership team she has set a clear direction for the service where the best interests of children are at the heart of decision making. For example, there are rigorous recruitment processes for the selection and induction of nannies, so that a best possible match can be made with families.</p><p>Children are very well supported by their nannies and visiting teacher to develop a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing, and competence as learners as they progress through their early childhood years. They, and their parents, benefit from the close, trusting relationships they have with their nannies. With the guidance and support of the visiting teacher, nannies implement meaningful learning programmes, consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, within homes and the wider community. Since ERO‚Äôs 2014 review, visiting teachers have increased the range of resources and prompts for nannies to assist them in using te reo MƒÅori with the children. It is now time for the visiting teacher to encourage nannies to implement Te Tiriti-based bicultural curriculum in deeper ways.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning is enhanced by the many opportunities they have to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learn about the wider world by attending playgroups and exploring community facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop early literacy and mathematics concepts in everyday experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend their strengths and interests and learning dispositions through the individualised programmes provided by the nannies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers and children with additional learning or health needs are well provided for in their own homes. Nannies closely follow the family routines and develop secure bonds with the children. Daily contact ensures information is shared in a timely manner. Nannies know the family‚Äôs culture, values and aspirations for their children and work very well to respect and respond to these.</p><p>The company's visiting teachers work very well together as a collaborative team. They have developed sound systems and processes to build consistency of practice across the networks. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making effective use of digital technology to support regular meetings and access information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peer assessment and a robust appraisal system that is contributing to improved teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shared expectations about what constitutes high quality practice and a consistent approach to coaching and mentoring nannies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective systems for planning, assessing and evaluating children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the homes maintain the company‚Äôs expectations for health and safety practices, consistent with the early childhood education regulatory framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As a result nannies are very well supported in their work. They benefit from the regular contact they receive from their visiting teacher and the many resources and ongoing professional learning and development opportunities made available to them.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well aligned to the company's strategic plan and has a focus on improving outcomes for children. Visiting teachers include a wide range of views, including those of nannies and parents in evaluation processes. The director and visiting teachers agree that a next step is to better document the evaluation of the strategic plan and that the recorded outcomes of internal evaluation more clearly show the shifts in teaching practice and the difference made to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The director has developed many useful systems to inform her about the quality of care and education in each of the networks. She works very effectively with visiting teachers and the leadership team to lead and manage the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the director and leaders of the service agree that next steps to improve practices and processes are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>better document the evaluation of the strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show in the recorded outcomes of internal evaluation the shifts in teaching practices and improvements to children's learning and, where appropriate, show alignment to the company's valued outcomes and learning priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles through policies and practices and build nanny confidence and capacity to implement a bicultural curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Nanny Company - Southern Two completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>10 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
