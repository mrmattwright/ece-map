</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Sparks Childcare Henderson is a large early childhood centre that provides education and care for up to 120 children. It is one of three centres in the Auckland area that are privately owned by Bright Sparks Childcare Limited. The centres share the same philosophy, which is based on three pillars: <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, Reggio Emilia approaches and Christian values.</p><p>The centre provides for children in developmental and age-related groupings in two separate areas for children from birth to three years of age, and for those from three to five years of age. The owner/manager ensures high teacher to child ratios are maintained. The centre serves a culturally diverse community. Teachers reflect the cultural diversity of children who attend.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review there have been some staff changes. A new leadership team has been appointed. The majority of teaching staff are registered teachers and have been employed in the centre for some time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engaged in an inclusive programme. They move freely around attractive learning environments and participate well in personal and centre-wide routines. Many are developing self-help skills and take responsibility for themselves and participate especially well in tidying the environment after mealtimes.</p><p>The programme continues to be linked to a number of community initiatives such as creative dance and movement, swimming, cycling, and healthy living. Professional development has been focused on exploring ways to strengthen the curriculum, understanding infant and toddler care and development, and becoming more knowledgeable about children's diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Children's experiences in the centre are mostly based on activities and centre routines. A stronger focus on noticing and responding to children's own interests would help teachers to increase the complexity of children's learning.</p><p>Centre environments are uncluttered and provide lots of space for children to play, both indoors and outdoors. Teachers could strengthen opportunities for learning by enriching environments with equipment and resources that could support more complicated learning during play.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming, friendly and generally supportive of children. Good relationships have been developed between teachers, children and parents. Children's cultures are celebrated in the programme.</p><p>Teachers have had a recent focus on developing their understanding of bicultural practices. The local kaumātua, whānau members, and staff willingly contribute their knowledge of karakia, waiata, te reo and tikanga Māori. The centre now proudly uses, and teachers strongly identify with, a whakataukī (traditional proverb) that was shared with them.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to reflect on their children's general development and share this with teachers. Teachers have begun to use whānau feedback about children to encourage their participation in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are committed to working in partnership with parents of children with special learning needs. These children are fully integrated into the programme, and do well with additional specialist help and support.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further improvements could be made to centre practices by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>engaging professional development support for all staff to strengthen the planning, assessment and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>basing teaching practices more closely on the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Licensing Criteria for</em> <em>Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness of the centre's philosophy in practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building the professional knowledge and capability of the centre leaders in their roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including parents and children in centre decision-making and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Managers have developed useful teacher appraisal systems.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Sparks Childcare Henderson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Sparks Childcare Henderson will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
