</table><p>The centre needs further support to improve the programme for children, develop sustainable and effective self review systems and to strengthen leadership capacity.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lupesina Aoga Amata Preschool is a bilingual Samoan centre located on the grounds of Glendene School in West Auckland. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including 10 up to two years of age. It works closely with Glendene School to support children to transition positively from early childhood to primary school.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te</em> <em>WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy also values parent partnership with teachers as key to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>The service is owned by an incorporated society and governed by a board of trustees. Members of the board include staff members and a parent representative. A centre director oversees the daily operations and administration of the service.</p><p>The centre opened in 2010 and was first reviewed by ERO in 2012. Since then its roll has increased and is now operating at full capacity. The centre has 14 staff that include five qualified early childhood education (ECE) teachers.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the centre was providing a culturally responsive curriculum in the Samoan language and culture, and in te ao and te reo MƒÅori. These good practices have been sustained. However, managers and teachers have made little progress in the areas ERO identified as needing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers' relationships with parents and whƒÅnau are responsive, reciprocal and respectful, supporting children to have a strong sense of belonging. Teachers support children to play inclusively and cooperatively with other children.</p><p>Children are settled and actively participate in the activities provided by teachers. They independently access resources and have some opportunities to make decisions about their play. Teachers model Samoan language and culture, and include aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a separate room. Their care routines are individualised to their needs. Teachers in this room are affectionate and help promote children‚Äôs exploration and language development. As teachers build their knowledge of effective education for this age group, they should provide more stimulating and developmentally appropriate programmes.</p><p>Teachers are developing programmes that involve children participating in teacher-directed activities. Teachers should be planning activities that follow children‚Äôs interests and are aligned to<em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Older children are provided with formalised learning activities. Teachers should now promote literacy, mathematics and science as part of children's play.</p><p>The learning environment is well defined and, after morning tea, children can choose between indoor and outdoor play. The large outdoor playground is popular with children. The inside walls and doors of the building are in need of a good clean. The board should also prioritise renewing some of the outdoor equipment and indoor resources. A wider variety of good quality resources is needed to challenge and extend children‚Äôs learning and play.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre director agrees that teachers will need support to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a systematic approach to planning for and assessing children‚Äôs learning over time</li>
<li>robust self review processes to evaluate teaching practices and promote better learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>shared understandings of what effective teaching looks like in relation to current early childhood educational theories.</li>
</ul><p>The centre director recognises that she and board must act with urgency to:</p><ul>
<li>support centre leaders to build their leadership capacity</li>
<li>implement appraisal processes for teachers aligned to the <em>Registered Teacher Criteria</em></li>
<li>develop the centre‚Äôs strategic and annual plans in consultation with teachers and parents, and to formally document key actions made to achieve the centre‚Äôs goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lupesina Aoga Amata Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the quality of the curriculum, leadership and self review. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>plan programmes that are clearly responsive to children‚Äôs individual strengths and interests</li>
<li>establish formal and regular self-review practices to guide ongoing improvement and sustainable good practice</li>
<li>ensure suitable personnel management practices are implemented and a high quality professional mentoring programme is developed to support provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>implement appraisal procedures using the <em>Registered Teacher Criteria.¬†</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, GMA 6, 7,¬†</em><em>Education (Registration of Early Childhood Services Teachers) Regulations 2004,¬†</em><em>Part 10 of Education Act 1989.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develop an action plan to address the key next steps and actions for compliance outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Lupesina Aoga Amata Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>26 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
