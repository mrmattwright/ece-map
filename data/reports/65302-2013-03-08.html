<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A supplementary review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kaikoura Playcentre¬†governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the April 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>incorporating MƒÅori perspectives</li>
<li>association support and centre sustainability.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kaikoura Playcentre is one of 49 centres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association‚Äôs education and centre support teams provide support for the centre. The parents‚Äô cooperative is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. The centre operates for two morning sessions each week for children aged from birth to school age.</p><p>The centre parents have made significant progress in improving the areas identified in the April 2012 ERO review report. They have established effective child assessment, planning and evaluation practices to improve learning outcomes for children. Self review is becoming well established. It is resulting in improvements to the programme and children‚Äôs learning opportunities. Bicultural perspectives are evident in the programme and the parents have plans to continue to increase te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The playcentre association has increased its support for the centre. More parents are involved in the parent education programme. Their understanding of playcentre has increased and they are making good use of the information to improve children‚Äôs learning. The additional support from the association will need to be continued to ensure parents remain committed and the playcentre is sustained.</p><p>Positive and caring relationships between children and parents, evident at the time of the 2012 ERO review report, have been maintained. The playcentre is well organised, presented and resourced as also identified in the April 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Planning and assessment practices</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The April 2012 ERO report identified that the parent group was in the early stages of re-establishing planning and assessment practices. Parents needed to focus on recording children‚Äôs learning and using the information to plan and provide programmes for children.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The parents have made significant progress. They have made good use of the playcentre association parent training courses and guidelines for child assessment, planning and evaluation. Assessment and planning records provide useful and regular information about individual children‚Äôs learning and development. Child profiles identify children‚Äôs learning and progress. Programme plans are beginning to include useful information to help parents extend the learning of individual and small groups of children. Attractive wall displays give suggestions that help parents to support the learning of all children. The displays also suggest a range of ways that parents can contribute to assessment, planning and programme evaluation.</p><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p>The parents are beginning, and need to continue, to increase the information in the child profiles about next steps for learning. They should particularly focus on the ways that parents can support this learning in their work with children during the programme.</p><h3>Self review</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The April 2012 ERO report identified that the self-review purposes and practices needed to be better understood by the parent group. Processes for regular and useful self review that improved learning for children needed to be put in place.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The centre parents have made significant progress. The parents have made effective use of the playcentre association guidelines for self review. The process clearly identifies areas for programme review, what is going well and what needs to be improved in these areas. The parents have developed some useful action plans for assessment, planning and evaluation and bicultural perspectives in the programme. As a result, significant progress has been made.</p><p>The parents have formed a self-review committee. The playcentre reviews are attractively displayed and show evidence of an in-depth self-review process that is resulting in improved outcomes for children.</p><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p>The association and centre parents need to make sure the good self-review practices are sustained when changes of membership occur within the parent group.</p><h3>Incorporating MƒÅori perspectives in the programme</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous ERO report identified the need for parents to increase the bicultural knowledge, understanding and practices in the programme.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The parents have made significant progress. They are making better use of the local Kaikoura environment to include bicultural perspectives into the centre programme. Wall displays often include te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. The parents are beginning to sing waiata and use simple te reo MƒÅori at the parent meetings and within the programme.</p><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p>The parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps include strengthening partnerships with MƒÅori families attending the centre and living in the wider local community.</p><h3>Association support and centre sustainability</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous ERO report identified that the centre parents were not always well supported by the association. Parents were not very involved in the playcentre parent education programme. This was affecting the quality of the programme for children‚Äôs learning and systems for maintaining a safe and healthy environment for children.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The playcentre is currently sustainable and well supported by local families and the association. The level of association support has increased since the previous ERO review. Parents are making good progress in completing the parent education courses. New families have enrolled at the centre and are becoming involved in the operation of the centre and the parent training programme.</p><p>Procedures for monitoring health and safety have improved. The centre provides an attractive and inviting environment for children and families.</p><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p>The association, centre parents and ERO agree that the association needs to continue to provide additional support, particularly increasing parents‚Äô access to the parent education programme within their community.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 569px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

More parents are involved in the parent education programme. Their understanding of playcentre has increased and they are making good use of the information to improve children‚Äôs learning. The additional support from the association will need to be continued to ensure parents remain committed and the playcentre is sustained.</p><p>Positive and caring relationships between children and parents, evident at the time of the 2012 ERO review report, have been maintained. The playcentre is well organised, presented and resourced as also identified in the April 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p>
