</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz @ Wintec is located at Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec) in Hamilton and provides all day education and care for children from three months to school age. It is licensed for 50 children, including 20 under two years of age. The centre caters for children of students enrolled at Wintec. Children attending come from many different nationalities and ethnicities, and including a wide geographical area. The centre runs two areas to cater for the age ranges and ability levels of children.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Wintec management. The Wintec Customer Support Services Manager (WCSSM) provides valued support for the manager and team leader of the centre with regard to leadership, personnel management, health and safety, and policies, procedures and guidelines.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims for teachers to provide a child-centred, play-based education. Teachers plan to purposefully extend children's learning and development, and support them to become confident and capable learners.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, staffing has remained consistent at the centre. A new team leader, appointed in mid 2015, is supported by other long-standing staff members. Teachers have engaged in extended professional learning and development to respond to the identified key next steps in the 2013 ERO report. The reviews of assessment, planning and staff appraisal have resulted in significant improvements in all areas. The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidz @ Wintec is very well placed to promote and sustain positive outcomes for children and their families. The principles of<em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, are successfully interwoven into the centre's philosophy and are clearly evident in the centre's high quality education practices.</p><p>The centre provides equitable outcomes for all children. Teachers are active advocates for children and their families, as many arrive and settle into new communities. Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are effectively fostered through the positive, trusting and respectful relationships at all levels. They confidently interact with teachers, who are highly responsive to their interests, strengths, abilities and needs. Well-established partnerships with families are a strength of the centre. Leaders and teachers promote children's holistic development and contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to engage in a range of sustained play experiences, both by themselves and with others. Teachers use intentional teaching and learning strategies, within the context of child and teacher-initiated play. They encourage independent, shared discovery and decision making, with many opportunities for children to develop learning dispositions, skills and competencies. The environment caters for a variety of interests and encourages children to explore and investigate. Children are empowered to develop as confident, capable learners.</p><p>Teachers are skilled in promoting oral language development, particularly for children with English as a second language. They effectively incorporate literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas into the programme, enabling children to engage in meaningful and interesting learning. Bicultural practices are well embedded and highly evident. This promotes and values MƒÅori children's language, culture and identity and develops all children's appreciation for MƒÅori as tangata whenua.</p><p>The wellbeing and learning of priority groups are actively promoted. A strength of the service is the cultural diversity of teachers. The expertise of these teachers is used to support communication with parents and children. All teachers research other languages and cultures to help their understanding of individual children and their families. Children benefit from culturally responsive interactions to support their learning.</p><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy personalised care and learning routines in a calm, unrushed and relaxed environment. They enjoy many opportunities to interact and build strong attachments with adults. Teachers know children well and, in collaboration with parents, are responsive to individual rhythms, cues and needs. They provide consistency and continuity for babies in order to establish a secure foundation for their care and education. Transitions into the older age-group area are managed sensitively and flexibly, ensuring children are confident in their new environment.</p><p>Older children transition to a large number of schools. Recent self review has affirmed teachers' focus on building children's social competencies, learning dispositions and self-care skills. This focus supports children's positive transition to school.</p><p>Assessment and evaluation processes are well established. The outcomes and results form the basis of programme planning. Observations identify children's strengths and interests, and enable teachers to plan relevant learning opportunities. The focus on dispositions extends individual children's learning. Effective evaluation practices enable teachers to reflect on positive outcomes for children and the effectiveness of teaching practices.</p><p>The experienced and knowledgeable centre manager has established a culture of relational trust. Leaders competently support teachers to build the quality of their teaching and children's learning. Staff regularly evaluate the effectiveness of teaching and learning. They access professional development within Wintec and the wider education community. Comprehensive appraisal processes are aligned to the Education Council requirements and Wintec expectations.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified the need to strengthen teachers' goals so they are more strongly aligned to improving outcomes for children, with measurable criteria for evaluation. There is also a need to improve the quality of teachers' evidence in relation to their goals and the practicing teacher criteria.</p><p>The planned review of the outdoor environment is likely to provide more opportunities for open-ended exploration and creativity, and promote increased equitable opportunities to cater for the ages and ability levels of all children. Highly effective, and well-developed self-review practices, including regular coaching and mentoring by leaders, are leading to continual improvement in centre practices and result in positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz @ Wintec completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz @ Wintec will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 September 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h4>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
