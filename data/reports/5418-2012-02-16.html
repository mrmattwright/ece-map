<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Edmonds Smith Street is located in the Woolston/Linwood area of Christchurch. Since the 2007 review, the kindergarten has reviewed and changed its hours of operation to meet the needs of the community. The kindergarten now operates Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association and the kindergarten teachers have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p align="left">Families are warmly welcomed by friendly and caring teachers. Teachers focus on building trusting and inclusive relationships with parents and children.</p><p align="left">Teachers work well with each other and other adults at the kindergarten. They have built strong links with community services and support agencies. The kindergarten has developed as a hub for the community that helps to support positive outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>teachers who support children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop social skills</li>
<li>children who are actively involved in the natural, spacious, outdoor area</li>
<li>the wide range of well-presented learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers, with the support of the education service manager, have made some recent changes to assessment, programme planning and self review practices. The next steps are to build on and refine these processes and to continue to strengthen bicultural practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Edmonds Smith Street was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Edmonds Smith Street.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten vision values every child&rsquo;s contribution to the programme. Teachers foster children&rsquo;s belief in themselves as successful learners now and in the future.</p><p align="left">Teachers aim to create an environment where children and their families are made to feel part of the kindergarten. Children are encouraged to take care of each other, the resources and the learning areas.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Inclusive relationships</h4><p align="left">Teachers foster trusting relationships with children and families. They know children and families well. Teachers and children enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and have fun together. Parents and children are warmly welcomed by friendly and caring teachers. Teachers promote useful ways for parents to share information about their child to support their well-being. Teachers work well together and communicate effectively. They have built strong links with community services and support agencies. They work successfully with other adults and community groups who assist children in the programme. Effective links to local schools help children and their families make a successful start to school.</p><h4>Developing social competence</h4><p align="left">Teachers actively foster children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging. Children are well supported by teachers to develop appropriate social skills to enjoy their relationships with others. Children are familiar with the expectations of the kindergarten that teachers encourage in consistent and respectful ways. Children generally play well with others. Children are confident to share ideas with each other and invite teachers into their play. Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s independence and self-help skills. Children successfully approach teachers and other adults and ask for help. Teachers promote a sense of trust for children and show an interest in what they are doing.</p><h4>Teaching strategies</h4><p align="left">Teachers use effective ways of working that build on children&rsquo;s interests and support their inclusion in the programme. They work with children in calm and unhurried ways. Teachers encourage children to challenge themselves and to keep trying. They celebrate children&rsquo;s success with them. Teachers notice and respond to children&rsquo;s individual preferences, interests and needs. They listen well to children and make good use of questions to build on children&rsquo;s language development. Teachers make good links to children&rsquo;s prior experiences from home to the kindergarten to build on opportunities for learning. Teachers actively take part in children&rsquo;s play.</p><h4>Learning environment</h4><p align="left">Teachers plan learning areas that are well organised and that capture children&rsquo;s interest and involvement in the programme. Children are actively involved in a wide range of learning experiences. Children generally respond well to familiar routines of the kindergarten that provide long periods of uninterrupted time. Attractive and informative wall displays show the learning that is valued and children&rsquo;s participation in the programme. Visual language prompts and literacy experiences are features of the kindergarten. The spacious outdoor space provides many opportunities for children to be involved in physical play and places for children to explore and make their own discoveries. The environment reflects many aspects of the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h4>Building on and refining assessment, programme planning and self review and the use of te reo M&#257;ori</h4><p align="left">Teachers have made some recent changes to assessment, programme planning and self review practices. Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to build on and refine these processes by.</p><p align="left">In assessment:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the practices they will use to build on individual children&rsquo;s prior learning</li>
<li>more clearly show children&rsquo;s progress over time.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In planning:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly showing how individual children&rsquo;s information is used to plan the programme</li>
<li>more clearly describing the intended learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>evaluating teaching strategies and the impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Self review and bicultural practices could be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the processes used for self review so that they more clearly show the impact of reviews on improving the quality of teaching outcomes for children</li>
<li>continuing to provide further opportunities to integrate te reo M&#257;ori into the programme.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the kindergarten is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The kindergarten currently has some children enrolled who have been identified as having moderate to severe special needs. The kindergarten has support through the association&rsquo;s policies and guidelines on inclusion.</p><p align="left">Kindergarten processes guide teachers in supporting children with moderate to severe special needs and their families. This includes a flexible approach to transitioning into the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is experienced in working with children with special education needs. The teachers have well-developed links with local schools that assists children and families during the transition to school process. The kindergarten also has well- established and positive links with specialist support agencies and key people that help them to meet the needs of children with moderate to severe special needs and their families.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Edmonds Smith Street completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>

Since the 2007 review, the kindergarten has reviewed and changed its hours of operation to meet the needs of the community. The kindergarten now operates Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association and the kindergarten teachers have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p align="left">Families are warmly welcomed by friendly and caring teachers. Teachers focus on building trusting and inclusive relationships with parents and children.</p><p align="left">Teachers work well with each other and other adults at the kindergarten. They have built strong links with community services and support agencies. The kindergarten has developed as a hub for the community that helps to support positive outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>teachers who support children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop social skills</li>
<li>children who are actively involved in the natural, spacious, outdoor area</li>
<li>the wide range of well-presented learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers, with the support of the education service manager, have made some recent changes to assessment, programme planning and self review practices. The next steps are to build on and refine these processes and to continue to strengthen bicultural practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
