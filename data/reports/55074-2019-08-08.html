</table><p>Tikokino Playcentre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tikokino Playcentre is located rurally in Tikokino Central Hawkes Bay. The centre provides two sessions weekly for 30 children, including 10 up to the age of two. At the time of this review 24 children were enrolled.</p><p>The centre is administered by Playcentre Aotearoa, Lower North Region and is supported by a regional manager. National policies are in the process of being developed and distributed to all playcentres for discussion.</p><p>The¬†Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, 'whƒÅnau tupu ngƒÅtahi ‚Äì families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this, the centre philosophy highlights respectful relationships as a community of learners.</p><p>WhƒÅnau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children. Curriculum planning and implementation is a shared responsibility. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by a session support staff and centre-elected office holders. A centre support worker and centre administrator regularly visit playcentres to provide professional guidance and support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The January 2016 ERO report identified areas for development for the association and the playcentre. These included: assessment, planning and evaluation; engaging with Playcentre training; building te ao MƒÅori practices; and strengthening knowledge and understanding of self review. These areas still require further development.</p><p>The review was part of a cluster of four playcentres in Central Hawkes Bay.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are active, independent and cooperative learners. They lead their learning and make choices based on their interests, strengths and preferences. Well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas invite children into play.</p><p>Positive relationships between children, peers and adults supports children's sense of wellbeing, belonging and ownership in the centre environment. Young children are nurtured in an inclusive learning environment. The centre has positive links with the local school and transitions processes are being progressed to support children's learning pathways.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are developing areas. Leaders and members identify that knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori needs to be further strengthened.</p><p>A clear process guides assessment, planning and evaluation. Curriculum planning is responsive to children's developing interests. Parents are beginning to work with the goals, ways of learning and outcomes of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These are included in some children's individual learning plans and profiles.</p><p>An internal evaluation framework has been introduced and is in its initial stages of implementation. Members identify the need to further extend their knowledge, practice and use of evaluation for improvement.</p><p>Leaders have undertaken professional development to strengthen individual member's knowledge and understanding of early learning. There is a strong focus on increasing membership, encouraging adult education and supporting new members into centre roles. At a regional level it is timely to review, monitor and evaluate the quality of systems to support provision of this education to playcentres.</p><p>The appraisal process is currently based on annual review of successes and challenges. This requires further strengthening to better reflect roles and responsibilities and respond to building centre support workers and members' capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build members' knowledge and understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include the stories of hap≈´ and iwi, to deepen children's understanding, particularly for MƒÅori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level (Playcentre Aotearoa), priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement national policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal process for employed staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide education for members to build playcentre capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the new regional team actively monitor and evaluate the quality of support provided to playcentres.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tikokino Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Governance, Management and Administration criteria. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring all children‚Äôs workers who have access to children are safety checked in accordance with the Children‚Äôs Act 2014.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7A]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review, Playcentre Aotearoa has provided evidence to show the safety checking of its workers has been undertaken.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>8 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
