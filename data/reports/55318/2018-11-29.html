</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Raureka is an early childhood centre located in Hastings that provides education and care for children from birth to school age, five days a week. Of the 58 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, 41 identify as MƒÅori. Separate spaces are provided for the different age groups within the centre. Children have opportunities to interact between areas, in the recently upgraded indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The majority of teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day centre operation is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports the teaching team. A professional services manager has oversight of curriculum development and delivery, and a business manager supports the centre with administration, licensing, employment and finances.</p><p>ABC Raureka is owned and operated by Best Start Educare Limited. In November 2018, during the ERO review process, it changed its name to BestStart Raureka. BestStart policies and procedures guide operation and provide business management services.</p><p>The November 2015 ERO report identified that building internal evaluative capacity and improving the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation required strengthening. Significant progress has been made in relation to these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A clear vision for the service aligns to the centre's philosophy. The focus is on responding to the needs of priority learners and strengthening collaboration with whƒÅnau and the community. The service's recently reviewed philosophy is underpinned by the vision and based on the MƒÅori principles of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, ≈´kaipotanga and wairuatanga. A collaborative approach to teaching and learning with increased deliberate focus on what this looks like in practice is evident.</p><p>Children are confident, settled and enjoy the company of their peers. They independently seek their own learning experiences through the use of a range of open-ended resources and flexible learning spaces that promote investigation, curiosity and imagination.</p><p>Children benefit from a curriculum where they contribute to decisions that affect them and take on leadership roles. Very young children through to older children demonstrate confidence to play and learn independently and collaboratively. Respectful, trusting relationships between children, educators and families contribute to a calm, settled environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured to become active communicators and explorers. Care routines are unhurried and an enjoyable part of children‚Äôs learning opportunities. Programmes for these very young learners focus on fostering their wellbeing through responsive caregiving.</p><p>There is a collaborative approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. Ongoing discussions occur to develop and improve teaching and learning practices. Observations of children in everyday activities help to build a picture of what they know and what they are interested in. Documenting continuity of children's learning and extension of their emerging interest has been strengthened as a result of professional learning opportunities. Leaders are aware of the need to further strengthen evaluation of planning to show progress over time and make evident, deliberate teaching strategies.</p><p>There has been a deliberate focus on strengthening relationships with parents and whƒÅnau. Their aspirations are valued and contribute to the programme. Learning partnerships are emerging as teachers seek and respond to parent aspirations. Teachers show a commitment to supporting Pacific success for these learners and their families.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are growing their knowledge and understanding of what success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori learners looks like at this service. Appropriate resources, displays and practices that reflect te¬†ao MƒÅori demonstrates that teachers promote and value children's culture, language and identity. Strengthening the bicultural curriculum in children's assessment continues to be a focus.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to achieve positive outcomes. Teachers identify and seek relevant support. They work in partnership with families and external agencies to promote consistent strategies and monitor progress for these children.</p><p>Leaders work together to improve practice and ensure the everyday operation of the service. The centre manager is committed to developing leadership within the team. The head teacher models positive, respectful relationships and leads a collaborative team. Well-developed systems guide centre operation from the organisation level. Teachers are well supported to grow their practice within a robust appraisal process with professional learning aligned to centre priorities.</p><p>A useful internal evaluation framework has been implemented. This contributes to a shared knowledge and understanding of how evaluation contributes to decision making, change and improvement. A next step is to use evaluation to monitor and evaluate the impact of practices on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that important priorities for ongoing development are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Raureka completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Raureka will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</span></p><p>29 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
