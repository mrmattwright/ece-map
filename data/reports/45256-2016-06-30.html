</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2012, this early childhood centre was acquired by the Best Start group. At that time (2014) Best Start operated two services in Alexandra. In 2015 the group merged its two centres into one with the name First Steps Matau. The service now provides education and care for 47 children, including up to 15 children under the age of two. Children under the age of two have a separate inside and outdoor area as well as access to the wider environment. The centre is led by a manager, her second-in-charge and a head teacher who has responsibility for the infant area.</p><p>Significant work by the centre leaders helped ensure a smooth merger of the two services. The leaders successfully united the team of teachers by leading the development of a comprehensive centre philosophy based on key values. Teachers have a shared understanding of the centre's priorities for learning which are based on RIE and Pikler concepts. Teachers consistently work to promote these which include turangawaewae (a sense of belonging), respect, independence, and empowering children to be confident and capable life-long learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a strong sense of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga evident at the centre. Families and children are warmly welcomed and well cared for. Teachers know the children well and place high importance on developing positive, trusting relationships between themselves and families.</p><p>Teachers deliberately foster a calm, peaceful and uncluttered environment for learning that is home-like. Children are confident, settled and engaged, and play meaningfully alone or with others. Teachers are passionate about their work and constantly reflect on ways to deepen their understanding of each child and how best to nurture and support their needs and wants. Teachers are very sensitive to the diverse needs of the children and work deliberately to provide extra support for their learning as required.</p><p>Other features of the centre that promote positive outcomes for children include the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integration of aspects of tikanga MƒÅori, waiata and language in the daily programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wide range of experiences that build and extend children‚Äôs interests both indoors and outdoors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular communications teachers have with parents in a variety of ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ways teachers share knowledge between themselves to purposefully promote and extend children‚Äôs interests and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children in the infant area enjoy lots of music and have access to a wide choice of activities and experiences. The teachers interpret and sensitively respond to their subtle cues. The calm, unhurried and settled environment enhances children‚Äôs wellbeing. Teachers enjoy having parents participate in the programme and value their comments and ideas.</p><p>The Best Start organisation has a range of systems to support developments and improvements at the centre. It provides ongoing professional development for staff and has established regional and online networks for leaders and teachers. There are effective systems to inform Best Start that key aspects of the service are evaluated regularly and that health and safety and other requirements are being met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and teachers know that the priority for the centre now is to consolidate the significant progress made during the past year. They need to ensure the good practices embedded at the centre are maintained and built on and they have a range of useful systems and processes to support this. The next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the bicultural practices that teachers follow are reviewed on a regular basis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving documentation to clearly identify the specific knowledge that teachers have about children's learning, culture and interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the systems used to ensure that all children are planned for regularly over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring the indicators used when developing practice are clear and specific to the focus and help guide the process at all stages.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Matau completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.¬†</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Matau will be in four years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>
