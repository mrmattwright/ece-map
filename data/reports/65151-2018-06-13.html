</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiddies Campus provides full-day education and care for up to 50 children from birth to school age. It is privately owned. The staff are qualified early childhood or primary school teachers.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, the outdoor areas have been further developed and include a separate area for children under two years old.</p><p>The centre supervisor has been building a collaborative teaching team and strengthening the way teachers evaluate the impact of their teaching on children's learning. Aspects of internal evaluation, the centre's strategic planning, and assessment and planning have been strengthened and remain areas for continuing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whƒÅnau are made to feel welcome, well supported and are actively encouraged to be involved in the centre. Teachers use a range of ways to communicate with parents and know the children well as individuals and learners. Children's needs and interests are identified and quickly responded to. Teachers successfully extend children's skills and knowledge through well focused conversation and planned exploration. They interact positively with the children and make the learning fun, safe and engaging.</p><p>Children experience a wide range of activities, in the indoor and outdoor areas. The programme reflects a strong commitment to Aotearoa/NZ's rich bicultural heritage. All children, and in particular MƒÅori children, have many opportunities to learn aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. The wider cultures of children and teachers are also valued and celebrated.</p><p>Children's transitions into, across and out of the centre are well managed. Children with additional needs are well supported and experience positive outcomes. Babies and toddlers enjoy respectful and nurturing interactions with their teachers.</p><p>Parent input into their child's learning is actively sought in a variety of ways. There is a good level of communication between staff and parents focused on children's learning and wellbeing. The expertise of parents and local community is sought to enrich the learning programme.</p><p>The centre supervisor has strengthened teaching and learning practices. Teachers work collaboratively and support each other to extend their professional learning. Good systems are in place to monitor and build teacher capability and for effective operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>show the depth of rich learning occurring within the learning areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assess and evaluate the progress children are making in their learning against identified goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of internal evaluation need to be strengthened so the service knows that its desired outcomes for children are being achieved. To do this the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>simplify the centre philosophy to more clearly show the key valued outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve strategic planning to better reflect the key valued outcomes and how these are to be achieved over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more regularly monitor and review progress in meeting the strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiddies Campus Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiddies Campus Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>13 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
