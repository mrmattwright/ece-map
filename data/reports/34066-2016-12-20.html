</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hillcrest High School Community Child Care, located in Hamilton city, provides education and care for children from three months to school age. This not-for-profit, community-based centre is governed by a board of trustees consisting of parent and staff representatives. The centre operates a mixed-age programme where there are many opportunities for infants and toddlers to play and learn alongside their older peers. It is licensed for 34 children, including eight aged under two years. The centre's multi-cultural roll of 40 includes eight Māori children and ten of Asian descent.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the centre manager has continued in this role. A staffing restructure has led to the appointment of a new team leader in 2015. Most of the teaching team has remained the same.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Leaders and teachers have made good progress in responding to the area for development identified in the 2013 ERO report about strengthening assessment processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hillcrest High School Community Child Care is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that supports their sense of wellbeing and belonging. They enjoy respectful and reciprocal relationships with their teachers and one another. Strong tuakana/teina relationships, where older children support their younger peers, are clearly evident and support the centre's calm and settled atmosphere. A significant part of the programme experienced by older children, particularly in the mornings, is mainly teacher led. This structure limits children's opportunities to follow and extend on their emerging interests. Younger children have more opportunities to engage in self-initiated play.</p><p>Particular strengths of the programme that promote positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>opportunities for safe physical challenge and exploration in the natural outdoor play areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular trips into the local and wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ready access to an extensive range of good-quality resources and equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for parents and community members to share their knowledge and expertise with children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children's transition to school is supported by the close relationships that are being developed with local primary schools.</p><p>Individual portfolios provide an attractive record of children's participation in the programme. Under the leadership and guidance of the new team leader, teachers are increasingly identifying children's learning in these portfolios. To further develop this assessment practice, teachers should consider how they show children's learning progress over time in these portfolios.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy caring and nurturing relationships with teachers. They benefit from learning alongside their older peers and siblings. Teachers ensure that infant's and toddler's care needs are well met. They work in partnership with parents to support each child's individual home routines. Children and toddlers are settled and respond well in calm learning environments.</p><p>Māori children's language, culture and identity is acknowledged and valued. The regular use of waiata, karakia, and teachers' increasing use of te reo Māori, particularly at mat times support this. Strengthening aspects of te ao Māori in the programme has been identified as an area for further development.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They respond positively to children's interests, learning, and care needs. Teachers work well together as a team and model appropriate language structures that support those children who have English as a second language. They ensure that the multi-cultural nature of the centre is recognised, celebrated in the environment, and at special community events. Teachers place priority on literacy and mathematics learning, particularly in the teacher-led parts of the programme. They should now give consideration to further implementing approaches that support children's literacy and mathematics learning opportunities through self-initiated play. Children's sense of culture, identity and belonging are enhanced by positive and responsive interactions with teachers, and their families.</p><p>The experienced centre manager is highly respected by staff and parents. She is very supportive of teachers and families. She is well supported by the new team leader. They work effectively together to lead professional practice. The team leader has introduced a new approach to assessment and planning practices that are supporting teachers to better identify and respond to children's learning and interests.</p><p>Trustees provide supportive governance for the centre. They are well informed about centre operations and have a strong focus on financial sustainability, meeting health and safety requirements and supporting leaders and staff. An appropriate range of policies have been developed to guide centre operations. These are regularly reviewed in consultation with parents and staff.</p><p>Centre leaders are implementing useful self-review processes. However as identified in the 2013 ERO report there remains a need to further develop these practices. Aligning self review to the intent of the centre's philosophy and positive outcomes for children is likely to better enable the leaders and teachers to better evaluate the effectiveness of key aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for centre leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the programme, particularly for older children, to provide greater opportunities for children to follow their emerging interests and engage in sustained uninterrupted play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening self-review processes to enable them to make more informed decisions about centre development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Leaders need to access external professional learning for teachers to support their understanding of implementing a more child-led curriculum and strengthen self-review practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hillcrest High School Community Child Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hillcrest High School Community Child Care will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>20 December 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
