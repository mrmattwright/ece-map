</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikiwi Kindergarten provides interesting and enjoyable educational programmes for up to 40 children in the morning and 30 in the afternoon. Some of the children attend all-day sessions. Children come from a wide geographical area that includes urban and rural settings.</p><p>The kindergarten is located close to neighbouring schools in the Invercargill suburb of Waikiwi.</p><p>Teachers have established meaningful links with these schools.</p><p>The children benefit from child-centred learning projects. Many of their interests are the starting point for these projects. A feature of the programme is the weekly nature-based bush programme for the older children. This programme encourages and allows children to develop their independence, initiative and thinking skills in a natural context.</p><p>The teaching team is made up of six teachers. Their philosophy is to support children to develop skills and attitudes to be life-long learners and active participants in their community.</p><p>Since the November 2010 ERO review, there have been improvements to the indoor and outdoor environments and group programme planning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teachers know the children and their families well. The children‚Äôs strengths, capabilities and family cultures and backgrounds are strongly evident in their profile books. Teachers gather and respond to parents‚Äô views and wishes for their children. They also use meaningful ways for children to share and extend their learning at home.</p><p>Children play and learn in a settled learning environment. They have good friendships with one another and play well for sustained periods of time. They are actively involved in the learning experiences provided and make good use of the wide range of resources. Children show a strong sense of belonging in their kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers are supportive and nurturing. They have useful conversations with children to support them in their learning. They are sensitive to individual children‚Äôs needs and learning styles. They use a range of strategies to ensure children are able to fully participate in the kindergarten programme.</p><p>Features of the programme that support children‚Äôs learning include:</p><ul>
<li>a weekly active-movement programme that focuses on developing children‚Äôs physical skills</li>
<li>early literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>fostering of friendships, independence and confidence</li>
<li>group music and movement sessions.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from group programmes that:</p><ul>
<li>include their ideas and suggestions</li>
<li>develop over time</li>
<li>encompass a wide range of learning areas and contexts, such as construction, drama and art</li>
<li>involve visitors to the kindergarten and outings in the community</li>
<li>make use of parents‚Äô strengths and interests.</li>
</ul><p>There are formal and informal small and large-group times where children have learning-centred conversations with their teachers, and are supported to explore ideas.</p><p>Teachers make good use of local school facilities and often take the children to special events and activities at school. This helps children become familiar with the school environment.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers work well as a team. Since the last review they have implemented deliberate strategies to build effective working relationships and systems for ensuring good communication.</p><p>Teachers have developed the centre vision and redeveloped the centre philosophy. They regularly consider aspects of their work and make improvements to the programme and practices.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long-term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten‚Äôs outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in attractive and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory-support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Waikiwi Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>make clearer alignment from the vision and philosophy to the curriculum and desired outcomes for children</li>
<li>develop planning that identifies the priorities and associated goals needed to achieve their vision and philosophy</li>
<li>develop actions and plans to develop a stronger bicultural curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Records of group and individual planning for children need to show more clearly:</p><ul>
<li>the intended learning</li>
<li>what teachers will do to support children‚Äôs next learning steps.</li>
</ul><p>Evaluations of group and individual planning need to show the difference the teachers have made to children‚Äôs learning. Evaluations should show how the next steps have led to progress over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waikiwi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waikiwi Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
