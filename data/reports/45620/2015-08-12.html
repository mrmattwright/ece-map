</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beginnings and Beyond Quality Preschool Beach Road is located in Papamoa, near Tauranga. It provides all-day early childhood education and care. The centre is licensed for 50 children including a maximum of 19 up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 44 children were enrolled, of whom 19 were identified as MƒÅori, and 3 as Pacific from Samoa or the Cook Islands.</p><p>This centre continues to be led and managed by an experienced owner/director. Since the 2012 ERO review, there have been changes to the leadership in the two age-group areas. These are Teina Ruma for children up to two and a half years, and Tuakana Ruma for children over two years and up to school age. The centre works closely with a nearby centre under the same private ownership.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to give children/tamariki opportunities to explore a variety of learning experiences and build supportive, collaborative relationships with parents, whƒÅnau and the wider community. The centre is committed to respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi and including appropriate tikanga and te reo MƒÅori in the curriculum. Children‚Äôs language, culture and identity are important aspects of centre practice.</p><p>The centre was established in 2011. The 2012 ERO report identified the centre‚Äôs effective management and identified good quality teaching and learning leading to positive outcomes for children. The centre currently employs a high proportion of qualified, registered and experienced staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in both age group areas are well-settled, enjoy their time at the centre, and are actively engaged in their play and learning. They form friendships with their peers, and benefit from the centre‚Äôs positive, welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. The interesting and attractive environments are equipped with quality equipment, furniture and resources. They offer a wide variety of choices, promote creativity, and invite children‚Äôs exploration and involvement. Children also have opportunities for visits in the community, including to local parks, the beach, and neighbouring businesses. They are able to select books fortnightly from the mobile library van. Parents feel welcome, are able to spend time alongside their children, and share home information about their children‚Äôs wellbeing and interests.</p><p>Babies and toddlers in Teina Ruma benefit from a positive and captivating environment for discovery learning, with a strong emphasis on sensory experiences. Teachers respond sensitively to children‚Äôs needs and interests. Children‚Äôs oral language and communication skills are fostered through teachers‚Äô ongoing conversations, which recognise children's gestures, investigations and interactions with others. The indoor and outdoor environments support children to make choices, and develop their physical skills and independence. Babies and toddlers are growing as capable, confident learners. Their transition to Tuakana Ruma is individualised, undertaken at an unhurried pace, and is responsive to the parents and their children.</p><p>Teachers gain an in-depth knowledge of children through positive interactions and communications with children and their parents. They integrate children‚Äôs ideas into their emergent planning and support their choices of activities and experiences. The Kea Kids group for four-year-olds provides opportunities for children to add complexity to their learning in ways that acknowledge their interests and preferences. These experiences, together with their earlier learning, contribute to children‚Äôs confidence and readiness to transition comfortably to school.</p><p>The centre programme is based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, together with children‚Äôs interests and choices, and teachers‚Äô own knowledge and understanding. Literacy and numeracy are integrated in the programme in natural ways. Environmental education is integrated through the care of vegetable gardens, pets, and a worm farm. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are valued by the centre. Children enjoy participating in waiata and himene, and often share their singing at home. Maori perspectives are also included in the programme through routines, celebrations such as Matariki, annual visits to a local marae, and a formal farewell to children moving to school. Teachers provide children with positive guidance that assists them to respect the centre‚Äôs high expectations and manage their relationships with others.</p><p>Teachers identify children‚Äôs learning in assessments that are available in both hard copy and digital portfolios. They provide perceptive records of children‚Äôs engagement and learning. Children enjoy sharing their portfolios and parents especially appreciate the digital resource. They are increasingly commenting on their children‚Äôs learning and progress, and sharing information with teachers about home experiences. Teachers are informally gathering information about parents‚Äô aspirations and goals for their children. They should now consider how well this is working, ensure that parent opinions are regularly obtained, and make certain that teachers‚Äô prompt responses and children‚Äôs growth are visible in portfolios.</p><p>Centre leaders strongly support the vision and philosophy of the centre. They meet regularly, and each month head teachers prepare detailed reports for the director about their areas of responsibility. These reports provide information that is useful as evidence for self review, strategic planning, and appraisal. Teachers have opportunities to take leadership in areas of interest or expertise. Currently, a leadership self-review is being undertaken to evaluate and further define head teachers‚Äô roles in supporting and enhancing teacher capability.</p><p>An increased focus on self review has assisted teachers to develop a sound process for long-term, planned self review. This has resulted in improvements to aspects of the curriculum and centre procedures.</p><p>The experienced director, in consultation with teachers and parents, has developed a sound policy framework that guides practice. Since the 2012 review, the centre has further developed the philosophy to provide more details about the goals and aspirations for children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing. It is now a more valuable resource that could be used to provide guidance and indicators for self review, encompassing aspects of centre operation and development.</p><p>Performance management processes are robust, and provide teachers with honest feedback related to their professional roles, expectations and goals. A range of professional development opportunities has been available to assist teachers to progress their goals and professional capability. The director recognises the importance of continuing to recruit and support highly capable teachers who are able to work as part of a collaborative team committed to valuing and celebrating children for who they are, and what they bring to the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the service should continue with:</p><ul>
<li>the current review of centre leadership, to ensure ongoing development of capability for leaders and teachers and commitment to relevant professional development</li>
<li>the progressive development of the strategic plan to define the centre‚Äôs future goals and actions for development, including an emphasis on teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre now needs to review the content of children‚Äôs portfolios. Attention should be given to managing teachers‚Äô time commitment while recording assessments that achieve the desired outcomes for teaching, learning and evaluation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Beginnings &amp; Beyond Quality Preschool Beach Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Beginnings &amp; Beyond Quality Preschool Beach Road will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 August 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
