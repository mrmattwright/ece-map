</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids Virginia Avenue early childhood complex in Mt Eden provides high quality care and education for children from three months to five years of age. It provides sessional and full day programmes. The complex is licensed for up to 136 children, including 40 under two years of age. Children and teachers come from a very diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. The largest cultural groups are Indian, NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, Asian and MƒÅori.</p><p>The complex consists of five centres that provide age-appropriate play and learning spaces and programmes. Programmes and practices strongly reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These are well aligned with the Kidicorp Ltd vision for effective early childhood care and education. High value is placed on equitable outcomes for all children and their families.</p><p>The recently appointed complex manager has built on the strong foundations of collaboration and team work established by the previous manager. The leadership team of complex manager, assistant manager and head teachers work well together. Their aim is to enhance teaching and learning experiences for the children in their care. Teachers demonstrate a professional and nurturing approach towards children and their families/whƒÅnau. Staffing remains relatively stable and the emphasis continues to be on enhancing professional practice.</p><p>The complex operates under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. Professional and administrative direction is provided by a Kidicorp professional services manager and a business manager. The organisation provides frameworks, policies, support and guidance to develop and monitor consistency of practice. Provision is well implemented and regularly reviewed.</p><p>The positive features acknowledged in ERO‚Äôs 2012 report continue to be evident. Centre leaders responded positively to the priorities for development noted in that report. As a result, they have deepened bicultural practices and built capacity for effective self review. Significant renovations and improvements have improved the indoor and outdoor areas, and resources. This helps teachers cater for the wide range of children‚Äôs interests, abilities and learning styles.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Interactions between teachers and children are underpinned by high levels of care and respect. Partnerships between teachers and children and their families are based on genuine acceptance, respect and a willingness to listen. Children of all ages engage confidently and independently with teachers. Their talk is encouraged, accepted and respected. They respond well to teachers‚Äô high expectations of them as competent, confident learners. They have fun in the well resourced, attractive environment.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of identity, well being and belonging are nurtured through teachers‚Äô culturally responsive practices. Teachers are deepening their understanding of MƒÅori language, culture and identity. Bicultural awareness and appreciation are evident in this service. Children‚Äôs diverse cultures are well reflected in the environment. There is a strong programme of inclusion and support. This enables children who have additional learning needs to play and learn with, and alongside, their peers. Generous support is provided to enable children to attend Topkids Virginia Avenue.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from consistent care giving. Teachers respond sensitively to each child‚Äôs changing needs and preferences. Their developmental needs and interests are a central focus for their individual programmes. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace. Younger children have space and the time to lead their learning.</p><p>The curriculum is based on children‚Äôs emerging interests and dispositions. Teachers look at ways to extend each child‚Äôs learning within the context of their interests. Teachers are becoming more skilled at assessment practices that blend literacy, maths and science with children‚Äôs interests. Learning stories are informative and are a good record of children‚Äôs involvement in the programme and activities. The teaching team plans collaboratively. This planning is clearly displayed for parents and children. It provides a strong stimulus for children to revisit their learning. Teachers and parents consult regularly and well. This provides teachers and leaders with valuable information to improve the quality of children‚Äôs care and education.</p><p>The learning environment is inviting and encourages children‚Äôs exploration. It is regularly reviewed so that it clearly reflects and responds to children‚Äôs emerging interests. The environment offers good opportunities for children to develop their play independently or in groups. It includes a wide variety of natural material and cultural artefacts that reflect the cultural backgrounds of children and their families/whƒÅnau.</p><p>The service actively seeks and uses parent input. Digital records of children‚Äôs learning have recently been introduced. This enables the service to immediately share with parents, poignant moments of children‚Äôs development and learning. This is proving to be an effective way of including parents and their wider families/whƒÅnau in their children‚Äôs learning. Leaders are keen to extend this approach and to increase parents‚Äô knowledge about the significance of early childhood education as the foundation for children‚Äôs future learning.</p><p>Self review is very well used to improve children‚Äôs transition into and within the service and to school. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging, security and familiarity are nurtured well to build their confidence and well being. Children‚Äôs transitions are handled responsively and are timed and paced appropriately for each child and their family.</p><p>A strong focus on continual improvement is evident. Self review is well used to improve all aspects of service practices, management and organisation. The collaborative and inclusive approach to self review is strength. A good example of this is the current review of each centre philosophy, and the overarching complex philosophy. This approach develops shared teacher understanding and collective responsibility for improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Complex leaders and centre teachers have a good understanding of the dual purposes of self review for accountability and improvement. The service‚Äôs strategic direction has clearly defined priorities and goals for high quality care and educational outcomes for all children. Promoting and monitoring children‚Äôs physical and emotional health and safety, is underpinned by strong systems, policies and practices. These are well understood by staff.</p><p>The teacher appraisal process has been recently reviewed and refined. It is being well used to identify appropriate and individualised professional development for teachers, and for the complex as a whole. The process encourages teachers‚Äô critical reflective practice to improve outcomes for children. Developing teachers‚Äô shared understanding of each of the registered teacher criteria continues to be a focus for professional development and discussions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders‚Äô priority to deepen their understanding and appreciation of effective bicultural practices is important and worthwhile. Developing a more in-depth understanding of biculturalism could enhance the quality of self review and potentially become a driving force for improvement and benefit children in the centre.</p><p>Leaders agree that the Ministry of Education documents of <em>Ka Hikitia, TƒÅtaiako</em> and the <em>Pasifika Education Plan</em> could be used to build their knowledge and professional practice. Making the complex‚Äôs commitment to bicultural practices, and to success for Pacific children explicit in documentation, practices and self-review processes would be valuable next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Virginia Avenue completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Virginia Avenue will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
