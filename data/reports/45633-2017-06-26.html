</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Good Beginnings Infants &amp; Toddlers is a privately owned and managed early learning service in central Masterton. It opens five days a week and is licensed for 21 children, including 20 up to two years of age. Children come from a range of cultural backgrounds. Ten identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The owners take responsibility for management and administration. An assistant supervisor leads the programme. Each teacher takes responsibility for the education and care of a small group of children. They are known as the child‚Äôs primary caregiver. Most teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of: meaningful, holistic learning; close links between the centre and homes; and alignment with Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The March 2014 ERO report identified areas for development. These included: strategic planning; cultural aspects of the programme; responsiveness to parent aspirations; and support for children with diverse needs. Progress is evident.</p><p>The owners also operate Good Beginnings Educare Centre that is close by and caters for children from two to five years of age.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from warm relationships with teachers who are sensitive to their cues. They work alongside children, supporting their developing interests and independence. Teachers liaise closely with whƒÅnau to align activities and care routines to those children experience at home. A range of useful information is shared with parents, who are regularly consulted about aspects of centre operation.¬†</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They closely observe individual children's interests that are discussed to inform the group programme. Planned experiences span a range of curriculum areas and are usefully aligned with the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em> Children are offered a rich play-based programme that includes a range of active exploration opportunities. They are regularly encouraged to revisit past learning. ERO and leaders agree that robust evaluation of the programme should strengthen planning for learning.</p><p>Children's transitions into and out of the centre are very well considered. Processes are flexible and individualised. Strong communication and consultation strategies ensure that parents and children are well supported at these times. Regular visits occur to the neighbouring Good Beginnings Educare Centre. Several staff work between the two centres, supporting children's sense of continuity and belonging.</p><p>Children's portfolios record their engagement in the programme. A next step is for teachers to develop a strong cyclic process of assessment, planning and evaluation. Documentation should clearly show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children's progress over time, resulting from the use of intentional teaching strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsiveness to parents' aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how teachers use cultural information to improve learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As this process develops, leaders and teachers should consider how they can draw on partnerships with families to actively promote the educational success of MƒÅori and Pacific children.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are clearly evident in the environment and interactions. Teachers are developing a relationship with local iwi, and have engaged in professional learning to support their implementation of a valuable bicultural programme.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported. Teachers collaborate with whƒÅnau and liaise with external agencies where appropriate.</p><p>Internal evaluations are collaborative and result in improvements. The process should now be refined. Teachers should gather data targeted to specific, measurable indicators. These indicators can then be revisited to measure the impact of changes.</p><p>Teachers meaningfully engage with current research and other professional learning opportunities. A useful appraisal process is established. Teachers are given clear direction and are well supported to continually improve their practice, for the benefit of children.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop and implement a robust cycle of individual assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the planned group programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue developing strategies to promote the educational success of MƒÅori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine the internal evaluation process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Good Beginnings Infants &amp; Toddlers completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Good Beginnings Infants &amp; Toddlers will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>26 June 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
