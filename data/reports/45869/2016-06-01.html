</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE New Plymouth Q2 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare. Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators and nannies to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes. PORSE also supports families and educators with professional development, administration and payroll services. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p><p>Evolve Education Group Limited purchased the service late 2014. With the change of ownership the existing structures for national support and community team management have continued. The senior leadership team report to a new Evolve board of directors.</p><p>PORSE offers two models of education and care: the Home Educator model, where an educator works in their own home; and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works in a family‚Äôs home. PORSE provides a range of training programmes and workshops for home educators, nannies and parents. Of the 99 children enrolled in the network, 19 identify as MƒÅori. This is the first review for this service.</p><p>The PORSE vision is ‚Äòexpanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home‚Äô.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of four home-based networks of PORSE In-Home Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a learning programme that is based on their interests. Educators follow these interests and respond by providing a range of activities. Regular, useful information is provided for parents about their child‚Äôs day. Parent feedback provides evidence of positive relationships between educators and children. Educators work in collaboration with parents as they support the transition to school process.</p><p>PORSE promotes their PlaySchool experience as part of the child‚Äôs overall learning programme. Programme tutors work collaboratively to identify purposeful strategies that help educators promote positive outcomes for children. They actively model how to support relationships with children at PlaySchool and other planned events.</p><p>Educators and programme tutors share a positive working relationship. Regular visits are completed by the programme tutor with a focus on building educator's understanding of and capability for working with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Specific feedback supports the educator to provide a programme reflective of the child's interests. A next step is to support educators in their understanding of identifying the significant learning that is occurring for the child. This information should then be used to plan a programme that challenges children in their play and learning.</p><p>The bicultural approach within a home-based context is developing. Documentation shows educators use of te reo MƒÅori, waiata and karakia. This continues to be an area for ongoing development. PORSE has developed plans to strengthen the participation for MƒÅori children in the organisation. A next step is to develop plans that have specific strategies to show how educational success for MƒÅori children will be promoted. Leaders should also revisit the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017</em> to support them in their developing understanding of working with diverse learners.</p><p>Some progress has been made in developing self review. PORSE managers recognise that deepening their understanding of the review and evaluation process is a next step. A more evaluative and systematic approach to review, that focuses on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice. In addition, managers acknowledge the need to review the philosophy in consultation with parents' and whanau.</p><p>Educators and families are kept well informed of the regular professional development opportunities provided. Development of the appraisal process has been ongoing. It is consistently implemented and identifies professional development needs. There is appropriate alignment of appraisal and practising teacher criteria. Induction processes for programme tutors and educators are clearly outlined in supporting documents.</p><p>Managers are improvement-focused and have some useful systems and processes established to track operational expectations. Better monitoring of the implementation of these systems and practices, including those relating to health and safety, is required.</p><p>PORSE administration systems effectively support educators, programme tutors and coaches in their roles. Strengthening guiding documents and practices relating to the considered use of information and communication technologies and social media, in an educational context, is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for this service are for leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build educator's understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural approach within a home-based context including the focus on promoting educational success for MƒÅori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop internal evaluation as a tool to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the PORSE philosophy in consultation with educators, parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE New Plymouth Q2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
<li>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice:</p><p>PORSE management should ensure that the system for all health and safety documents is consistently completed by all parties.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE New Plymouth Q2 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
