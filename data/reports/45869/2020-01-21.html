</table><p><span>PORSE New Plymouth Q2&nbsp;<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE New Plymouth Q2 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd. It is one of four networks in the New Plymouth/Hawera region. Of the 94 children currently enrolled, 13 are M&#257;ori.</p><p>Two options for education and care are offered: the home educator model where the educator works in their own home; and the nanny educator/au-pair model where an educator works in a family&rsquo;s home.</p><p>In this network three programme tutors, who are qualified and registered teachers, work alongside educators. Their role is to assist educators to implement care and learning programmes for children. Programme tutors are supported by a regional coach who reports to the senior leadership team.</p><p>At the time of the June 2016 ERO review the organisation had been newly sold to Evolve Education Group Ltd. In late 2018, it was purchased by Rainbow Group. There have been some changes in national and regional team management. A national role of curriculum and quality assurance coach has been created and a new regional community representative supports the Taranaki networks.</p><p>The PORSE vision is &lsquo;expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home&rsquo;. A philosophy guiding teaching and learning has been refreshed to better acknowledge a commitment to <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</em> It promotes authentic relationships, environments and learning experiences.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that improvement was required in relation to: internal evaluation; philosophy review; strengthening the bicultural approach with a focus on promoting educational success for M&#257;ori children; and improving assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning. Progress has been made in some areas, while others remain priorities for improvement. An area to improve practice in relation to health and safety records has been successfully addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have opportunities to participate in a programme based on their interests. They regularly socialise with other children while in their educator&rsquo;s care. A wide range of learning experiences within the local community reflects the PORSE commitment to place-based learning and real-life experiences.</p><p>Children of all ages benefit from positive and caring relationships with educators and programme tutors. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> concepts of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, whakamana and kotahitanga are evident across the networks.</p><p>A varied range of communication tools promotes consistency of care between children's homes and their home-based service. Educators and programme tutors work appropriately with families and external agencies to meet children's individual needs.</p><p>On-going observation of children in everyday activities builds a picture of what they are interested in and can do. Some educators and programme tutors use this information well to plan a programme that extends children's learning. New templates assist educators to develop a shared understanding of effective assessment practice. Strategies to ensure that children's learning stories reflect their culture, language and identity require strengthening. Attention should be given to improving monitoring systems to ensure that all children benefit from a curriculum informed by individual assessment.</p><p>Educators are making good progress in achieving appropriate qualifications to promote children&rsquo;s learning. They are well supported by a training programme that takes account of their individual circumstances and learning needs.</p><p>PORSE appraisal procedures support the development of teacher capability. Collaborative leadership is encouraged. The regional coach implements an increasingly rigorous approach to support teachers to grow their knowledge and skills. A quality practice template provides clear foci to further strengthen teachers&rsquo; evaluative capability against the <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession</em>. There is alignment to PORSE beliefs and values. Review is integrated through the appraisal process. Teachers are reflective. Professional learning opportunities are ongoing and informed by teachers&rsquo; goals and service priorities.</p><p>A growing range of resources and workshops supports programme tutors and educators to promote <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> based practices. This is in the early stages. Leaders continue to explore ways to integrate aspects of te ao M&#257;ori into the programme. This was a key next step in the previous report and remains a priority for improvement.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, a new system to improve health and safety practices has been introduced. This encourages educators to evaluate their own performance in meeting regulatory requirements. The new approach has strengthened educators' knowledge and understanding of the licensing criteria and enables programme tutors to focus on how well children's safety and good health are promoted.</p><p>Self review for improvement is established and has led to some positive changes. Staff are beginning to consider how well the curriculum and teaching practices are supporting improved outcomes for children. The use of research-based indicators should assist programme tutors in making rigorous judgements to inform future practice.</p><p>An appropriate governance and management framework guides operation and practice. Leaders are taking steps to streamline policy review. Ensuring all policies are clearly dated and regularly revised to reflect on-going changes is a key next step.</p><p>Systems to monitor PORSE expectations of educators and programme tutors are generally well established, with some recently revised following changes in the organisation. Leaders should ensure rigour in their monitoring of these systems to ensure PORSE values are consistently enacted in practice.</p><p>Leaders are in the early stages of introducing an evaluation process to measure the effectiveness of their governance and management framework. ERO's evaluation affirms this as a key next step for continual improvement. Managers should ensure that the recorded outcomes from this internal evaluation are used to inform decisions aimed at improving service performance and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Network leaders and programme tutors should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve consistency of assessment practice so that the curriculum for all children is informed by regular individual assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, wh&#257;nau and life contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Organisation managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen internal evaluation at all levels of the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> based practice in systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that all policies are appropriately dated and regularly revised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve monitoring systems to ensure that the PORSE philosophy and values are consistently enacted in practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE New Plymouth Q2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai P&#363;tahi Nui</span></p><p>21 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO&rsquo;s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
