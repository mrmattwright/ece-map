</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Top Kids Ngatai Road is an all-day care and education centre located in the suburb of Otumoetai, Tauranga and caters for babies, toddlers and preschool children. The centre is licensed for 60 children including 15 under the age of two, and has a current roll of 65 children of whom 12 identify as MƒÅori. Considerable building upgrades have enhanced the learning environment.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review a new centre manager has been appointed and there has been significant staff changes. These appointments have been well managed by the Professional Service Manager and Business Manager. The centre was formally governed by the Kidicorp organisation, which, since March 2015, has become BestStart and is owned by the Wright Family Foundation.</p><p>The centre has developed a new vision statement and philosophy that focuses on supporting the learning and development of babies, toddlers and young children within a safe, nurturing and respectful environment. Staff are working hard to address the area for review and development identified in the 2013 ERO report related to strengthening the use and understanding of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Policies and procedures are in place to assist with the provision for a safe physical and emotional learning environment for children and staff. The service enjoys positive community support.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The welcoming atmosphere and arrangement of activities and equipment reflect an environment that values children and their families. Teachers work effectively together in the interest of children and have established a constructive climate where children problem solve, take risks and experience success. Children choose their own play and learning, and are engaged in play for prolonged periods. They confidently share their ideas with teachers and other children.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs interests. They skilfully ask questions that encourage children to extend their thinking and model language structures and content. Positive and reciprocal relationships at all levels are contributing to a calm and settled centre atmosphere where children are developing a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Programmes include informal integration of literacy and mathematics learning in the context of play, the development of group skills such as taking turns, listening and sharing. Flexible routines are being developed to promote children‚Äôs independence and responsibility. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices are evident in the learning environment. Staff continue to strengthen the use of te reo MƒÅori so that it becomes a natural part of the daily programme.</p><p>Babies are well nurtured and cared for in attractive, spacious and comfortable environments. A strong emphasis on establishing warm relationships with key teachers and other staff provides a sense of security and belonging. Teachers promote opportunities for babies and toddlers to explore the natural world, outdoor equipment and resources that stimulate curiosity and problem solving.</p><p>The centre manager and second in charge are encouraging a culture of reflective practices and participate in centre self-review practices. They are clarifying teacher‚Äôs roles and responsibilities and developing a collaborative team approach to teaching, planning and aspects of centre operations. A clear, shared philosophy based on identified need and community aspirations is providing individualised programmes focused on children‚Äôs strengths and interests.</p><p>An effective and committed professional service manager and business manager work collaboratively with the knowledgeable centre manager to share an agreed framework for centre governance and direction for the service. They provide support and consistency through a period of significant staff changes.</p><p>Parents spoken to during this review expressed confidence that their children‚Äôs diverse needs were being catered for. They feel well informed through regular e-portfolios, newsletters and informal conversations with staff.</p><p>An appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies and practices contribute to the provision of an emotionally and physically safe environment for children and staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that the next areas for review and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure leadership has a clear understanding of current theory and continue to model collaborative practices that bring the new team together</li>
<li>establish an effective teaching team that shares ideas, works collectively and are supportive of one another</li>
<li>use effective assessment and evaluation practices to plan and implement varied and diverse learning programmes based on children‚Äôs exploration and play</li>
<li>strengthen teachers ability to integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori practices into the daily programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that BestStart and centre management provide staff with access to professional development for the areas identified under key next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Ngatai Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Ngatai Rd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>25 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
