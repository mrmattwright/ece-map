</table><p>BestStart Parton Road¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Parton Road is situated in Papamoa, Tauranga and has been re-licensed for 80 children including up to 16 children under the age of two years. At the time of this review 72 children were enrolled, including 13 who identified as MƒÅori. There are also children from a range of other ethnic groups. The purpose-built centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care in two age-based rooms and a discovery room accessible for the service's older children.</p><p>The centre's recently reviewed philosophy states that "teachers believe in building caring and inclusive learning environments, where each child's knowledge is extended to its full potential". Teachers work alongside children to learn from each other and support tuakana teina relationships.</p><p>Since the May 2016 ERO report there have been significant staff changes and the appointment of a new centre manager and head teacher. A professional service manager and business manager provide support for the centre.</p><p>The service is operated by BestStart, a charitable organisation owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Since the last ERO review of this centre a new Chief Executive Officer has been appointed. Regional and local professional service and business managers oversee the central North Island BestStart centres. Their vision is to work in partnership with families, whƒÅnau, teachers and communities to enable children to achieve their learning potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 15 reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><p>The centre belongs to the Tauranga Peninsula KƒÅhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have positive and responsive relationships with children. They use a range of teaching strategies to engage children in their learning. Teachers extend children‚Äôs thinking through in-depth discussions and open-ended questioning. Literacy and numeracy are naturally integrated in an environment that encourages critical thought, wondering and creativity.</p><p>Teachers maintain a calm and slow pace, supported by personalised routines for individual children up to two years of age. Children have easy access to an environment, that is well resourced and encourages exploration. Responsive care-giving is building a sense of belonging for these learners.</p><p>MƒÅori concepts, knowledge, te reo MƒÅori, values and beliefs are included in the curriculum. This supports MƒÅori children to be affirmed in their language, culture and identity. This also provides all children with an understanding of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa. Teachers provide regular opportunities for children to make sense of the natural, social, physical and material worlds. A next step is to continue to develop the localised curriculum.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is nurtured during transitions in to and within the centre, and when moving to school.</p><p>The service's curriculum effectively promotes positive learning outcomes for children. Children with additional needs benefit from an inclusive environment. Individual planning and assessment are suitably developed and include parent aspirations and individual children‚Äôs goals and next steps.</p><p>Leaders demonstrate a strong commitment to teaching and learning and foster collaborative ways of working. Reflective leadership is contributing to positive centre development, enhancing learning for teachers and promoting opportunities for children.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide centre operation. Self review has an improvement focus and includes ongoing consultation with families and whƒÅnau. A next step is for leaders is to support teachers to build their understanding and use of systematic evaluation practices. Internal evaluations should clearly measure and monitor the impact of practices against intended outcomes for children.</p><p>There is clear alignment between regional strategic direction and centre annual plans. The appraisal process assists teachers to inquire into and strengthen their practice. This process is supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Several initiatives to remove barriers to education, and support children's wellness, promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that leaders continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to know the impact of actions on improved outcomes for learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build the new team culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the local curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Parton Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>31 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
