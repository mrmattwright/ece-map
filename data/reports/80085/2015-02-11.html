</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Childcare (Oamaru) is a large, high-performing, privately-owned centre that has been in operation for five years. It provides care and education for children from three months to school age. The centre manager leads a team of two head teachers, each having responsibility for a different age group. Children from within the town of Oamaru and surrounding district attend. The centre is open from 7am until 6pm.</p><p>The centre provides children with food throughout the day. Meal times are an important aspect of the curriculum as many children spend most of their days at the centre.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre has successfully made further developments to:</p><ul>
<li>self review, which has strengthened the practices</li>
<li>strategic governance and management</li>
<li>processes for planning, assessment and records of learning for children</li>
<li>management systems to monitor and grow the quality of learning and teaching.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Governance and management are strong at this centre. This ensures that all aspects of daily practice are supported to be high quality. The senior leaders are empowering the teachers to use their strengths and develop their leadership skills. The leaders and teachers find the appraisal process encourages useful discussion and drives up teaching practice.</p><p>The manager spends time in the various rooms with the children and teachers, and is well informed about what happens for children in all areas of the centre. The strategic plan is well developed and guides the direction and focus areas for the year.</p><p>Self review is well understood by teachers and leaders. It is done in depth and leads to positive outcomes for children. It is triggered by identified needs. Current research is carefully considered when changes and further developments are made in response to findings. Professional learning and development is highly valued and included in the review process so that teachers are better equipped to support children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Children benefit from an inclusive culture at the centre where their backgrounds and cultures are known by teachers, valued and celebrated. The manager has deliberately sought to appoint teachers with specific links to the Pacific Island community and with strengths in building teachers‚Äô capability in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Throughout the centre the acknowledgement of, and commitment to, MƒÅori is well displayed and strongly evident. There is a conscious effort to introduce all children to cultures other than their own.</p><p>Children take part in a wide variety of interesting learning experiences. These include:</p><ul>
<li>excursions to local places of interest</li>
<li>indoor and outdoor activities with the aim of developing social, emotional and academic skills</li>
<li>early literacy and mathematics concepts integrated within daily programmes</li>
<li>children enjoying caring for centre pets</li>
<li>teachers providing activities of identified interest to children.</li>
</ul><p>Relationships, particularly in the infants‚Äô room, are supportive, positive and respectful and build on children‚Äôs identified interests. Teachers communicate closely with parents. ERO observed caring, nurturing teacher-child interactions. Teachers respond sensitively to children‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues. They provide a well-resourced, calm learning environment.¬†</p><p>The systems for ensuring clear communication are well developed and implemented. Teachers are thoroughly informed about the direction of the centre. Within each room, they have developed philosophies in line with the Little Wonders‚Äô philosophy to show the differing needs of the age groups. Parents are regularly communicated with about their children‚Äôs learning and the strategic focus areas of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that aspects of planning and assessment could be improved. After five years of development, the senior leaders recognise it is timely for them to focus more on reviewing the quality of what happens for children. To ensure that all aspects of centre operations are covered over time it would be useful to adopt a long-term view to planned self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Childcare (Oamaru) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Childcare (Oamaru) will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern Southern Region</p><p>11 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
