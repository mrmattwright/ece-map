</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>South Wellington Montessori School provides early childhood education and care for up to 20 children between the ages of two and a half and six years. The Montessori philosophy, blended with the early childhood curriculum <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, underpins programmes, practices and resources. Children attend the six hour daily sessions for up to five days a week.</p><p>The two teachers have owned and managed the service for nineteen years. They have established strong relationships with families and the community. A diverse range of ethnicities and cultures are represented within the centre.</p><p>Areas for improvement identified in the June 2012 ERO report included self review, appraisal, assessment for learning, and the bicultural curriculum. The teachers have responded well to these recommendations and have engaged in professional learning to support their development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a calm, well-organised environment. They have many opportunities to lead their own learning. They independently access a wide range of Montessori-based equipment both indoors and outdoors.</p><p>There is a strong focus on activities and resources which promote writing, mathematical concepts, physical development and practical life skills. Within the child-led programme, children engage and persevere in sustained periods of learning and play.</p><p>Strong, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children and their families underpin teaching, learning and decision-making. Recent formal consultation with families indicates high levels of satisfaction with approaches to foster children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Centre-wide review and development initiatives have led to increased teacher confidence and commitment to the integration of M&#257;ori language and culture into the curriculum. Teachers incorporate the skills and expertise that wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori bring to the programme. Community contribution has assisted to increase the visibility of te ao M&#257;ori in the environment. Teachers should now consult with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori learners about their aspirations for their children&rsquo;s success as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Children interact positively with each other. They are happily engaged and confident learners. They enthusiastically participate in conversations about their world and their learning.</p><p>Teachers are respectful of children and their learning choices. They skilfully promote children&rsquo;s conversation and make connections to their world. Teaching strategies encourage children to problem-solve and make decisions about their learning.</p><p>The promotion of independence and children&rsquo;s self-management skills is a significant focus within the curriculum. Children take responsibility for themselves, their belongings and the centre environment.</p><p>Teaches have made improvements to the ways they assess children&rsquo;s learning. Families&rsquo; aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning, as well as their home-life experiences, are included in assessment portfolios. Children access and share their portfolios with pride.</p><p>Teachers are developing the ways they document what they notice about children&rsquo;s learning and how they can respond to their interests and needs. They have identified assessment practice as an area for further review and development. This is an appropriate next step and is likely to enhance and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers should also consider how to better reflect children&rsquo;s cultural heritage in assessment practice.</p><p>Teachers support parents and families well as they prepare their children for transition into the centre and on to school. They have developed thorough processes to inform families about centre philosophy and practice. Provision is made for older children to experience literacy extension and leadership opportunities.</p><p>A clear philosophy and vision guide decision-making and approaches to children&rsquo;s education and care. Recently defined values are promoted in the programme and in daily interactions with children and their families.</p><p>The newly developed strategic plan identifies the service&rsquo;s current priorities and is well-aligned to self review and appraisal. Professional learning and development for teachers is closely linked to the strategic direction.</p><p>A well-planned and structured approach to self review leads to centre improvements. This framework has been used well to guide recent reviews and improve the quality of bicultural practice and partnerships with families. Teachers should continue to build their evaluative practice by monitoring the impact of teaching strategies and changes made as a result of self review.</p><p>Processes have been established for teacher appraisal and performance management. A next step is to further strengthen the appraisal process so it better supports teacher-managers to enhance their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the teacher-managers agree that the key next steps are to continue to strengthen processes in:</p><ul>
<li>assessment for learning</li>
<li>evaluative self review, and</li>
<li>teacher appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of South Wellington Montessori School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of South Wellington Montessori School will be in three years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title="">Joyce Gebbie Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>31 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
