</table><p>Centre managers require support to improve the quality of teaching and learning, and to establish effective management, personnel and self-review systems.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akaiti Mangarongaro is a punanga reo (Cook Islands Māori language centre) in Mangere. It was been established to promote children’s use of the Mangarongaro language and culture. It is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 40 children, including up to eight under two years of age. Infants and toddlers are integrated in a mixed-age programme.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Torohata Trust Board. The board employs two centre managers to oversee centre operations and administration, and three qualified teachers. The centre has been in new premises since 2016.</p><p>In 2013, ERO identified teaching and learning, management and self-review as key areas to develop. There has been minimal progress in these areas. The programme for children does not clearly reflect the goals and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Management systems, teaching practices and the learning environment, require improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and social with adults and their peers. They choose from the range of activities provided, play well with each other and have formed positive friendships. Children are familiar with and actively participate in centre routines. Teachers’ interactions with children are positive and supportive.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and approachable. Parents appreciate support from teachers in an inclusive, family friendly environment.</p><p>The programme for children should be based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Managers and teachers need to establish a culture of high expectations and a curriculum that reflects their shared vision and engages children in learning.</p><p>Teachers have identified the need for external professional support to help them implement effective teaching practices. A deeper understanding of theories about early childhood education would help them to improve the programmes for children. They should ensure the programme and teaching strategies are more responsive to children's individual interests, culture and identity and offers a range of engaging and physical activities.</p><p>Teachers have developed assessment practices with a focus on individual children. They provide whānau with regular information about their children's learning. Teachers now need to focus planning on teaching strategies rather than resources and activities. Sharing leadership roles would help them to establish sustainable practices.</p><p>Managers have identified the need to improve the learning environment. The new facility is not well designed to provide high quality programmes for children under two years of age. Setting up the environment in distinct, inviting play areas readily accessible resources, would support children's learning through play. Providing further opportunities for wonder, curiosity and creativity in the programme would increase children's learning.</p><p>Managers are in the process of developing systems to support centre operations. The centre's strategic plan could be strengthened by making links to indicators of effective practice. Managers have yet to establish useful internal evaluation systems to ensure that centre practices align with current legal requirements.</p><p>Policy review should be established to ensure that practices are aligned to current legislative changes. Performance management systems do not meet the requirements of the Education Council or provide teachers with feedback that helps them to improve their practice. Managers and trustees would benefit from external support to establish effective governance and management practices that prioritise children's learning, and actively encourage teachers' collaborative teamwork.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that their next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing more deliberate teaching strategies in connection with the goals and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting children’s exploration, creativity and oral language in well resourced learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving programmes for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using internal evaluation to improve the quality of governance, management, learning programmes and outcomes for children. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akaiti Mangarongaro completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, premises, health and safety, governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning, assessing, and evaluating a curriculum that is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>; responds to the learning interests, strengths, and capabilities of enrolled children; reflects an understanding of learning and development that is consistent with current research, theory, and practices in early childhood education; and encourages children to be confident in their own culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring there are safe and comfortable (indoor and outdoor) spaces for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting a child protection policy that meets the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing an ongoing process of internal evaluation to help the service maintain and improve the quality of education and care for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing suitable human resource management practices, including the implementation of a system of regular appraisal and provision for teacher professional development</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
