</table><p>Precious Kidz Homebased Care¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Precious Kidz Homebased Care is licensed to provide in-home care and education for up to 50 children, including 50 children up to two years. The network is privately-owned and led by the two owners. Most children who attend are of Samoan heritage.</p><p>The service has been operating since March 2017. One owner is the programme coordinator and is a qualified early childhood teacher. The owners work closely to provide systems and support for 10 educators who work in their own homes.</p><p>The Precious Kidz Christian-based mission and philosophy statements guide the service. The philosophy reflects a strong commitment to Aotearoa New Zealand's dual cultural heritage and values children as unique, precious learners.</p><p>Learning through play is promoted and <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is a foundation document for the service. Retaining each child's home language and learning to speak English are acknowledged as important for children's learning, wellbeing and success.</p><p>This is the service's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Service leaders value the diversity of their community. They promote a culturally responsive curriculum for all children. Pacific children and families are deeply valued and supported to experience success.</p><p>Educators are assisted to provide learning activities and safe environments for the children in their care. The small group size allows each educator to develop positive relationships with children and families. Together, educators and the coordinator, maintain portfolios of children's learning for each child. Individual and group learning stories capture children participating in a good range of activities and experiences that promote exploration and learning.</p><p>The coordinator knows children, educators and parents very well. Parents and educators receive useful information that sets out clear expectations of the service and educators. The coordinator continually supports educators to build their resilience and commitment to the service. Educators come together regularly for events, celebrations and meetings. Monthly playgroups include opportunities for educators to learn more about early childhood education and care. Parents are invited to, and often attend, the playgroups.</p><p>The coordinator visits each educator's home at least monthly to help foster children's learning and promote positive educator practice. Ongoing communication between educators, the coordinator and parents results in respectful, responsive relationships across the service.</p><p>Educators have regular workshops to deepen their professional learning and development. The owners have a relentless commitment to building a community of learners within the network to benefit children's holistic development.</p><p>The coordinator purposefully builds educator capability. All educators are encouraged and well supported to work towards completing a Level 4 early childhood qualification. Educators are assisted during their weekly study group by the coordinator. This approach helps to increase educators' confidence and success as learners.</p><p>Service leaders are highly reflective. They are implementing a useful appraisal process, with an external mentor, for the programme coordinator. Service leaders have developed a comprehensive policy and procedure framework. They have used external expertise to help them implement effective internal evaluation processes. There are many examples of evaluation practice across the service, including the outcomes of excursions for children's learning and safety. The collaborative approaches to internal evaluation ensure this is well used to improve systems and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building a deeper understanding of appropriate learning opportunities for children who are transitioning to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the</p>
<ul>
<li>regularity of individual learning stories in children's portfolios</li>
<li>focus on learning and teaching strategies in planning</li>
<li>consistency of assessment, planning and evaluation processes across the service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal process to include regular, documented observations of the programme coordinator's practice, and introducing an annual summary to show how the Standards for the Profession are being met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing the strategic plan to show how service priorities will be achieved each year.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Precious Kidz Homebased Care completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>16 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
