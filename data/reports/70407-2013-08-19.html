</table><p>Aratupu Preschool and Nursery is w<em>ell placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The centre is a service of the Christchurch Methodist Mission. It maintains a close relationship with the mission and support agencies to provide a wrap-around service for children and their families. The centre has a whānau support worker and health-care worker who work closely with families. Sixty percent of the centre children are Māori.</p><p>All teachers are qualified early childhood education teachers. A new head teacher was appointed in 2012. Two new staff were appointed just before this ERO review to replace teachers on parental leave.</p><p>The spacious and well maintained centre buildings include a whānau room that is used by families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy and the work of the service are strongly focused on meeting the needs of the children and their whānau. Priority is given to working with families and community agencies to ensure that all children have the best opportunities to learn and experience success. All centre staff are committed to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, and the provision of a bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Up-to-date policies and procedures provide effective guidance for the recruitment and development of staff.</p><p>A knowledgeable and experienced manager provides effective leadership and continuity for children, staff and families. The new head teacher has had training to support her leadership role. The centre manager and head teacher have established a positive culture in which children are valued, celebrated and recognised for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Centre leaders have high expectations for establishing and maintaining caring and nurturing relationships.</p><p>Centre leaders foster a collaborative way of working with staff and families. They provide regular opportunities for staff to discuss children’s wellbeing and learning.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum is strongly focused on supporting the learning of all children, with particular emphasis given to priority groups, such as infants and toddlers, and Māori children. Staff have shared beliefs about the best ways to support children’s learning. Teachers know about each child as an individual, and the challenges that many of their whānau and the wider community face. Children in the nursery are nurtured and well supported in their development and learning. Routines are flexible and responsive to each child’s needs.</p><p>The centre programme includes a good range of cultural, physical, environmental and musical experiences for children to enjoy. Children’s learning experiences are further extended with regular trips to the local and wider community.</p><p>The programme gives children many choices about how and what they will learn. The nursery and over-twos' outdoor areas have been improved since the 2010 ERO review. They now provide more inviting and stimulating places for children to play and learn.</p><p>Children have regular opportunities to hear and use te reo Māori and to learn about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers make good use of their observations of children to identify their developing interests, attitudes and skills. They record these in attractive and detailed learning journals.</p><p>Staff provide a welcoming and supportive environment for children and their whānau. They relate to the children in positive, sensitive and responsive ways.</p><p>Teachers actively foster children’s language development. They help children to successfully manage their relationships with others and accept the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Teachers benefit from targeted professional development to extend their knowledge of and skills in using effective practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s long and short term plans (strategic and annual plans) emphasise social support for children and their families. These plans need to be extended to include a greater focus on supporting children’s learning.</p><p>Key next steps to improve the consistency and quality of planning and assessment already identified by the centre are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the use of parents’ and children’s perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that Māori children’s culture, language and identity are well reflected in assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Other improvements that are likely to benefit children's learning include:</p><ul>
<li>making the teachers’ actions for extending children’s learning more explicit in learning stories</li>
<li>strengthening curriculum self review by including more planned and in-depth reviews of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aratupu Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aratupu Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
