</table><p>Leataata O Tupulaga O Le Pasefika¬†requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Leataata O Le Tupulaga O Le Pasefika managers and teachers require professional support to improve the quality of curriculum management and implementation, learning environments and provision for children's health and safety.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leataata O Le Tupulaga O Le Pasefika is an all-day education and care service that has been operating since 2002. The centre is licensed for up to 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. It provides bilingual education through gagana and aganu'u Samoa. Its philosophy promotes children's learning, fosters inclusive practices, and includes a commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>The Leataata O Le Tupulaga O Le Pasefika organisational structure is under review. The board currently functions as a management committee, and includes two parent representatives and the centre director. There are 12 permanent staff members. The centre director and five other staff are registered teachers. There are also four support staff, an office administrator and a cook.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified strengths in gagana and aganu'u Samoa, older children's use of gagana Samoa, and skilful use of bicultural practices. Next steps included teachers' planning for individual children's interests and facilitating a more child-initiated programme.</p><p>Good management practices noted in ERO's 2015 report included the establishment of policies and procedures and working relationships with local iwi. Areas for improvement included appraisal systems, internal evaluation and developing an annual plan. ERO recommended that leaders and managers participate in external professional development to support improvements. While some of these matters have been addressed, additional improvements are required.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and show a strong sense of belonging. They have opportunities to explore the environment and become familiar with pese (songs), tatalo (prayers) and leadership opportunities, including leading p≈çwhiri. Some children are fluent speakers of gagana Samoa and are confident to converse with teachers.</p><p>Teachers are friendly and welcoming. They show that they know children and their families well. Teachers are skilful in using and supporting children to acquire gagana Samoa. Some teachers demonstrate high levels of bicultural practice that reflect the dual heritages of Aotearoa.</p><p>There is some provision in the programme to develop children's early literacy, numeracy and science learning. It is timely now for teachers to review the structure of the programme in order to minimise the length of mat times and increase opportunities for child initiated play. Teachers could also review the learning environment and ensure children have access to a wider variety of quality resources that offer more challenges.</p><p>The programme is planned around themes and events that happen in the community. It does not provide children with sufficient challenge. Teachers should focus planning and assessment on children's individual interests and dispositions for learning. This would enable them to evaluate the impact of their teaching strategies on the quality of the learning and outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in professional learning development (PLD) and would benefit from participating together in PLD to develop shared understandings about intentional teaching practices and their impact on children's learning. PLD should also include a focus on strengthening internal evaluation understandings and practices.</p><p>The board has drafted a strategic plan. Board members and staff should continue to review the draft strategic plan to focus more on goals that improve the curriculum and build teacher capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and the board should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide further PLD for teachers to build their capability in planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the draft strategic plan to prioritise improved provision for children's learning, and develop management plans that show alignment between goals and operational systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adapt the service's philosophy to better reflect <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' and managers' understanding of internal evaluation that results in improved teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leataata O Tupulaga O Le Pasefika completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, health and safety, and personnel and financial management. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a curriculum that is consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and supports the learning and development of children up to two years of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of the learning environment and variety of educational equipment and resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety checks, including monitoring of indoor and outdoor environments to identify, eliminate or manage hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records for monitoring children's sleep, nappy changes and other routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safe hygienic practices throughout the centre, including sleeping equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk management processes and records for excursions, ensuring appropriate adult:child ratios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records and regular evaluation of emergency drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>up-to-date personnel and appointment policies and procedures, including police vetting of all non-registered personnel or volunteers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>separate reporting about the expenditure of equity funding.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1-4,7,13, HS17,8,10,11, GMA7, PF25.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. ERO acknowledges the receipt of a plan and actions already underway to address the actions for compliance noted in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>23 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
