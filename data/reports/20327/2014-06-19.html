</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Olive Shoots Early Childhood Centre operates on the Laidlaw College campus in West Auckland. The centre provides education and care for children of staff and students of the college as well as children from the surrounding suburbs. The licence provides full day care for up to 50 children, including 10 under two years of age. The college and the centre work closely together to provide the management and governance of the centre. Families who use the centre are able to choose sessions for their children to match school hours.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre identifies teachers‚Äô commitment to integrating Christian values and principles with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers recognise the Treaty of Waitangi as a foundational document, and embrace the concept of ako, children and teachers learning together, as their aspirational goal for working with children.</p><p>Children are grouped in three large rooms according to age. The younger group has children from three months to two-and-a-half-years. Children move rooms to be with older children as they are ready, and the last room is for children over four years old. Large playgrounds and access to a field alongside the centre provide opportunities for children‚Äôs physical and imaginative play. Better than average ratios of teachers to children enable close relationship building.</p><p>A management committee from Laidlaw College staff provide assistance with financial and personnel management and receive monthly reports on the curriculum and centre events. The comanagers of the centre organise their work time to ensure they are able to support teachers by working with children for some of the week. Most of the teachers in the centre are qualified.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report commented positively on the centre, and recognised the respect with which teachers work with children. ERO suggested that teachers could be more specific in their planning for children, build a more reflective culture, and continue to develop bicultural perspectives in their programmes. These suggestions have formed a framework for teacher professional development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Olive Shoots Early Childhood Centre continues to provide high quality care and education for children. Children are confident and trusting with teachers. They settle easily at the start of the day and show great interest and engagement in their play. They share their thinking and planning with each other and with teachers, revisiting their interests from previous days. Teachers‚Äô contributions and support for children‚Äôs play enable them to extend and enhance their own learning and professional understanding.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy caring relationships with teachers. They are confident to explore their attractive, age-appropriate environment. Children trust teachers to support their endeavours and provide encouragement. Teachers respond to children‚Äôs beginning language and non-verbal cues. Parents are comfortable to stay with their children and talk with teachers. The programme is responsive to the physical and emotional learning needs of these children.</p><p>Teachers provide a wide range of activities and experiences for children throughout the centre. Whole-centre professional development has helped to improve assessment and planning. A major self-review topic is focused on improving learning outcomes for children through focused teaching that supports children‚Äôs interests and strengths. Goals for individual children are displayed and guide teachers‚Äô discussions about next steps for the programme. This new way of working is proving effective for teachers and children. Parents spoken to during this review were enthusiastic about the quality of care and education their children receive.</p><p>Teachers include te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. Children are familiar with waiata, karakia, MƒÅori stories and books with MƒÅori themes. Displays in the centre indicate respect for MƒÅori culture and art. The centre has made special efforts to develop relationships with MƒÅori families and to learn about connections they are able to make within the wider community. A marae visit is planned for later in 2014.</p><p>Teachers learn words and greetings in languages other than English to welcome the families of children who do not have English as their first language. Teachers are aware of the need to continue to find ways of supporting these children to feel pride in their cultural heritage and success in their learning.</p><p>Management of the centre is efficient and effective. The co-managers‚Äô open, collegial management has built a strong teaching team with a shared vision for supporting children‚Äôs and their own learning. The managers have established sound self-review processes that include reflection on the effectiveness of teaching and learning programmes and their own management processes. A focus for 2014 is on trialling new appraisal processes that include continuing reflection by teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the managers agree that the next steps for teachers are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>building on and strengthening bicultural and multicultural practices</li>
<li>refining self review and increasing parent participation in self-review processes</li>
<li>implementing new appraisal systems.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Olive Shoots Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Olive Shoots Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
