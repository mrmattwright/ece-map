</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the second review of the Preschool. The relatively small, homely, purpose-built centre was previously known as Penguins School of Early Learning. Since the last review, the ownership, and name of the centre have changed.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 30 children, including up to 10 children aged under two years. Infants, toddlers and older children are catered for in two spaces with access to child-centred outdoor learning areas.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been reviewed and guides all practices and developments at the centre. There is a strong bicultural and multicultural focus. There is also an emphasis on promoting children's independence, choice and self-management skills.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the centre leader has built a professional teaching team who all share and actively contribute to the centre's philosophy and direction. Self-review processes and bi- cultural practice have been strengthened. In addition, parents and whānau input into children’s learning has increased.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are welcomed into a warm and inclusive culture. Well planned and managed routines help children settle quickly into self-directed play. Teachers' caring, unhurried interactions using children's home languages promotes and fosters children's wellbeing and helps to create a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that is well aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers have recently reviewed and made well-informed changes to the programme. The learning programme builds on children's emerging interests and individual learning dispositions.</p><p>Children engage in sustained collaborative play and show respect for one another. The centre is well-resourced and children have access to a good range of equipment. They have many opportunities to make choices about their play. Teachers encourage children to initiate play with others, establish friendships and build self-management skills. Children's growing social competence, independence and self-management is likely to support them when they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are collaborative and responsive to children’s learning needs. They actively encourage children’s thinking. Children's language, culture and identity are reflected and promoted well in the centre. Te reo and Tikanga Māori are interwoven effectively throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers work well with small groups of children at various times of the day. Staff expertise is used to provide a programme for children transitioning to school. Teachers also offer a programme with additional physical challenge for older children where age-appropriate skills are promoted.</p><p>Children approaching school entry get the opportunity to regularly make their own school lunch as part of developing their self-management skills. This approach has contributed to the centre recently receiving a healthy heart award. Children's early literacy and numeracy understandings are promoted throughout the programme. Teachers are aware of the need for the programmes for children transitioning to school, to reflect the centre's philosophy and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>A recently appointed team of teachers work alongside the centre manager to meet the needs of children aged under two years. Infants and toddlers experience an atmosphere of quiet, respectful, responsive care. Children have good access to age appropriate play equipment that provides opportunities for individual choice. There are very good systems in place for teachers to keep parents well informed about their child’s day.</p><p>The centre has identified the need to continue to involve parents and whānau with their children's learning. Parent feedback is regularly sought and information from parents is being used by teachers to shape and enhance the programme. Stories about children's learning are now being documented online and give parents up-to -date information about children's learning experiences. Parents can also share children's emerging interests with teachers on line, as they surface.</p><p>The centre manager maintains knowledgeable and capable governance and oversight of the centre. The policy framework and management planning are sound. She accesses support from external agencies with governance as necessary. Teachers participate in effective ongoing professional development to provide best practice in early childhood education and to make ongoing improvements to centre practices.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes have been strengthened. Good systems for self-review are in place. The centre has recently reviewed bi-cultural practices and health and safety, the outcomes of these reviews are becoming increasingly evident in centre planning and operations. A new staff appraisal system was introduced in 2016. Teachers could benefit from on-going professional development to effectively use this new on line system of documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for the centre include, continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>link programme planning with the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grow the leadership capacity of teachers, particularly in the under two area of the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' evaluations of learning in children's on line learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>provide support and guidance for teachers to ensure recent changes to the appraisal system and the practicing teacher criteria are effectively embedded.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of the Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of the Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 April 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
