<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Karori Kids Incorporated is an all day education and care facility licensed for 22 children, including one child aged up to two. It is situated in Karori, Wellington and governed by a parent committee operating as an incorporated society.</p>
<p>The centre manager, who is also the supervisor and administrator, is delegated responsibility for day-to-day management. At present, all children enrolled at the centre are over 2 years old and come from a range of cultural backgrounds. None identify as Maori.</p>
<p>The centre's vision is to 'provide quality education and care within a family environment in the heart of the Karori community'. This is underpinned by its mission 'to inspire courageous investigators within a secure, nurturing learning community'.</p>
<p>Karori Kids' philosophy statement, developed in partnership with families, emphasises the importance of celebrating children's successes, maintaining respectful, caring relationships, growing children's ideas and knowledge, and encouraging curiosity and problem solving. It respects and celebrates Te Tiriti o Waitangi and other cultures.</p>
<p>The February 2014 Supplementary ERO review was positive. Good progress had been made since the 2013 ERO report. It affirmed the next steps identified by the centre manager to further develop assessment for learning, evaluate practice in relation to the philosophy, and continue to explore ways to provide a curriculum that values the language, culture and identities of M&#257;ori children.</p>
<p>Since the 2014 ERO review a new teaching team has been appointed. Most teachers are fully registered. They are participating in professional learning and development to introduce an inquiry approach to learning that is clearly linked to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum statement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Karori Kids Incorporated is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. A family-like atmosphere is apparent, together with many aspects outlined in the philosophy statement. Diversity is valued and celebrated, and te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are woven into the programme.</p>
<p>Children happily engage in a range of self-initiated learning activities. They enjoy creative and imaginary play as they explore the well-resourced environment. Children are actively involved in learning and sustain play for a considerable period of time. They are developing as confident, competent learners.</p>
<p>Children are curious and approach teachers and other adults to ask questions and share knowledge. Teachers readily respond to their needs and participate in the learning activities. Relationships within the centre are warm, positive and respectful. Through children's learning inquiries, there is further opportunity to develop programme planning, assessment and evaluation, including for children with special needs and abilities.</p>
<p>Teachers know the children and their families well. Children's learning is clearly visible in centre displays. Families contribute to the programme through discussions with teachers and the use of digital technologies that give them easy access to their child's learning stories and photographs. The manager acknowledges the need to document each child's learning journey to show progress over time and feedback to families about the aspirations they have for their children.</p>
<p>Children are well supported when they transition to school. Teachers have worked with other centres and the local school to share practices. The centre's 'thunderbirds' programme for older children encourages their problem solving and self-help skills and competencies, together with literacy and numeracy. School visits support the transition process.</p>
<p>The centre manager provides good leadership and promotes collaborative teamwork. The recently introduced teachers' inquiry approach is well documented. Teachers are gaining a good understanding about this approach through coaching and professional development. It includes good guidelines for appraising teachers' practices and these are appropriately implemented.</p>
<p>Strong, knowledgeable leadership is provided by the chairperson of the parent committee. The centre's vision, mission and philosophy guide all operations. Strategic and annual plans are displayed in the centre and the related actions are regularly monitored to measure progress. Clear understandings about governance and management roles are apparent.</p>
<p>The centre manager, teachers and the parent committee are improvement focused. Aspects of the centre's operations have been informally and formally reviewed. The manager acknowledges the teaching team has yet to develop shared understandings about internal evaluation to strengthen this process.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO affirms the next steps identified by the centre manager to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>continue developing programme planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gain shared understandings about internal evaluation and how to best document planned evaluations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Findings from internal evaluation should help teachers and the parent committee identify what is going well and next steps for improvement towards achieving the centre's vision, mission, goals and philosophy.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karori Kids Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Karori Kids Incorporated will be in three years.</p>
<p>Joyce Gebbie</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ng&#257; Pou Here:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p>
<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
