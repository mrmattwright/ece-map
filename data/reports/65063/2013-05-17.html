<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Prebbleton Childcare and Education Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the April 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>relationships and interactions among managers, staff, families and children</li>
<li>how well the philosophy and curriculum support children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>how well the programme reflects the unique place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua and provides all children with the opportunity to appreciate New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage</li>
<li>progress in implementing the action plan and effective use of external support to bring about necessary improvements.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Prebbleton Childcare and Education Centre is one of three centres in Prebbleton owned and operated by the same managers. This centre caters for children from three years to school age. The staff are qualified early childhood teachers or in training as early childhood teachers. Many staff have worked at the centre for a number of years. A new supervisor was appointed in February 2013.</p><p>The managers and staff have made significant progress since the 2012 ERO review. The managers have shown considerable leadership and commitment to improving the centre culture and the quality of learning and teaching. Teachers responded positively to the report and have taken a number of important steps to improve relationships and the quality of the curriculum. The action plan developed with ERO has helped the centre to clarify and plan improvements. Professional development has also assisted managers and staff to make the necessary improvements. The centre is now much better placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The 2012, ERO review identified that relationships between the managers, staff, families and children needed to improve. The supervisor and staff needed to establish a more welcoming environment for children, families and centre managers.</p><p>At the time of the 2012 ERO review, the centre philosophy was no longer relevant to the staff. Each teacher had her own beliefs and values about children&rsquo;s learning and welfare. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New&nbsp;Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, was not evident in the programme. The supervisor and teachers acknowledged that they needed a better understanding of this document to use it effectively to support children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p>In 2012, New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage was not evident in the programme. The supervisor and staff had little knowledge or understanding of the ways that they should support M&#257;ori children and their families in the programme and acknowledge their culture.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Relationships between staff, children, families and managers have improved significantly. The new supervisor and teachers warmly welcome children and families to the centre. Teachers now spend considerable time with children. They listen to children, make suggestions and help children to play cooperatively with each other.</p><p>Teachers value and respect the support that managers provide. The managers and teachers made good use of an external facilitator to help them begin to resolve their relationship issues. The manager&rsquo;s appointment of a curriculum mentor has been well received by teachers. The mentor has high expectations, provides considerable support and models good teaching practice. ERO observed consistent teaching practice. Teachers and children appeared happy. Teachers were interacting positively with children and each other.</p><p>Managers and teachers are in the early stages of redeveloping a centre philosophy based on their values and beliefs for children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing. They are now consulting with parents before fully integrating this philosophy into the curriculum and teaching practices.</p><p>The centre supervisor and teachers have significantly improved the range of resources available to children and the presentation of the indoor and outdoor areas. The spaces are inviting and able to be accessed easily and independently by children.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are increasingly evident in the programme. The supervisor provides valuable guidance to the teachers and children about respectful bicultural practices. Staff appraisal goals and professional development opportunities are closely linked to staff continuing to improve their knowledge and skills in this area of the curriculum.</p><p>Managers have high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and improving the quality of teaching. Under their leadership, comprehensive plans have been developed. These plans began with the ERO action plan. The plans now give clear direction for achieving the centre&rsquo;s vision for high quality learning and teaching. There are clear links to a programme of regular curriculum review, staff appraisal goals and professional development opportunities.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the areas for further improvement include the supervisor and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>more effectively implementing <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> in the programme</li>
<li>establishing assessment and planning practices that successfully support children&rsquo;s learning and high quality teaching</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of curriculum self review and regularly undertaking reviews to continue to improve learning and teaching.</li>
</ul><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
