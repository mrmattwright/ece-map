</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Plum Tree Preschool, in Silverdale, offers sessional and full day care and education. It is licensed for 25 children, including six children under two years. The centre operates as two separate rooms, in an adapted house, catering for different age groups. The owner has recently purchased land next to the property to develop as larger playground areas and car parking for the centre.</p><p>The centre works closely with the nearby Plum Tree Preschool Millwater and both centres operate using the same administrative and management systems.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is based upon Christian beliefs. Teachers aim to provide children with meaningful learning experiences that supports their transition to school. They have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and valuing of all cultures.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report noted the welcoming and caring environment for children and their families. The centre manager and staff responded positively to the report’s recommendations for improvement to management processes and programme implementation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, have a strong sense of belonging and a positive attitude towards learning. They approach teachers with trust and affection when requiring reassurance or assistance. Children are happy, have fun and play cooperatively. They are socially competent and show respect for others.</p><p>Teachers provide a nurturing, friendly environment where children learn with support from attentive adults. Teaching practices facilitate children's exploration, language development and engagement with learning. Infants and toddlers benefit from individualised care and responsive attention from staff. Programmes and routines are flexible to cater for these young children’s developmental stages and parent preferences.</p><p>Teachers have recently been reviewing the way that resources and the environment are set up to promote children’s interest and learning. Children now have very good access to outdoor areas that allow for a range of engaging activities. Good use is made of the available indoor and outdoor spaces. Teachers nurture, promote and specifically plan for children's physical and emotional wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers have continued to develop planning and assessment practices that guide curriculum programmes. There is a balance of structured and child-led learning. The curriculum is underpinned by Christian beliefs and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Planning approaches are flexible, allowing teachers to respond to children’s interests alongside topic-based planned programmes. Planning is well documented and evaluated and visible for children and parents.</p><p>Teachers integrate te reo me ngā tikanga Māori into the programme. Teachers are keen to continue to enrich their bicultural practice. This has the potential to foster Māori children’s identity as Māori, while enabling all children to experience and learn about New Zealand’s bicultural setting.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers value parental and community involvement. Parents/whānau receive good information about their child’s learning and development. They are encouraged to contribute to the centre programme and join in events. There is a high level of parent satisfaction and appreciation of teachers and the programme.</p><p>The centre owner/manager is actively involved in the centre, provides professional leadership and is supportive of the teachers. She demonstrates strong, purposeful management focused on building the centre’s physical environment and teacher effectiveness. Teachers have leadership opportunities through their individual centre responsibilities. The centre manager and the supervisor regularly meet with the managers of the Millwater centre. Good systems to support teacher professional learning and self review are often carried out across both centres.</p><p>An efficient framework of administrative, personnel and support systems guides centre operations. Personnel provide regular professional development for leaders and staff to grow in their roles. Useful processes for internal evaluation are followed to monitor licensing requirements and teaching effectiveness. These processes appropriately include staff perspectives and ideas. Clear expectations in relation to the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em> should help guide teachers as they further develop and document their reflective practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified appropriate development priorities that include further:</p><ul>
<li>developing teachers' use of the environment and resources to provoke children's interests and extend their learning</li>
<li>developing teachers' reflection on the impact of teaching practice on children's learning</li>
<li>fostering parent partnership to support and broaden children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders could also continue to enhance self review with a clearer focus on identifying the effectiveness of centre systems and processes using indicators of success. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Plum Tree Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices the centre manager must ensure that all non-registered staff are vetted by the police every three years. At the time of this external evaluation there was one staff member who did not have a current police vet.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Plum Tree Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 May 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
