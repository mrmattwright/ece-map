</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergarten Wakatipu is located in central Queenstown. It provides education and care for up to 40 children attending up to six hours a day, five days a week. Children come from an increasingly diverse, and at times transient community.</p><p>The kindergarten is led by an experienced head teacher. The teaching team have a culture of shared leadership where all teachers contribute their skills and strengths. The kindergarten is now governed by the Canterbury/Westland Kindergarten Association, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten receives regular support from an Education Service Manager (ESM).</p><p>The good practices noted in the 2014 ERO report have continued to be sustained. The teachers have made good progress in deepening bicultural practices, as recommended in the 2014 report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three kindergarten reviews in the Canterbury/Westland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers form respectful, reciprocal and responsive relationships that support children's learning and wellbeing. Teachers are intentional in way they work with children and help them to think, problem solve and extend their interests.</p><p>The teachers have carried out significant work to improve bicultural practices. Children experience enriched bicultural programmes and practices. Teachers have used professional learning and development to develop their own knowledge and implement a culturally responsive curriculum. They have been considered and intentional in the way they have built their own capabilities and culturally responsive practice. Together with children they have learned a kindergarten mihi, karakia and waiata. Teachers have plans in place to continue developing their cultural competencies.</p><p>Children’s culture and language are acknowledged and well supported in the programme. Teachers carefully engage with families' language and culture to make the kindergarten more meaningful for children. This is evident through children's learning records for international families, and increasingly for Māori children.</p><p>Children's learning and wellbeing are supported by varied and interesting programmes based on the principles and strands of Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum. The carefully designed learning environments provide children with opportunities to explore and be challenged. Teachers have made changes to the programme and their practices to support the diverse needs of children attending. Children learn about mathematics, literacy and ICT in meaningful ways.</p><p>The teaching team work well together and share leadership responsibilities. A next step is to further deepen their knowledge and understanding of current theories of learning and development, and teaching to support evaluation of programmes and practices. The ESM and teachers have identified that a next step is to continue to find ways for children to be involved in decision making.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is currently under review, and is displayed for parents' comments. Teachers now need to work collaboratively with whānau to redevelop and refine the philosophy to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify desired outcomes for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align with identified curriculum strengths.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have developed useful systems to plan for individual children and assess their learning over time. Records of learning show that they are responding in greater depth to parents' wishes for their children's learning. Teachers make good use of ICT to share children's learning and play with parents and wider whānau.</p><p>The teachers and ESM identified that emergent and group planning continues to be a work in progress.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of inquiring into their teaching practices as part of appraisal. A next step is to embed the appraisal process and continue to develop teaching as inquiry.</p><p>Teachers have continued to develop internal evaluation practices. The next steps to strengthen internal evaluation are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focus the evaluative question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and make better use of indicators to guide the evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate to show how the indicators have informed and enriched programmes and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten receives effective support from the Canterbury/Westland Kindergarten Association. The association provides a useful strategic and operational framework for the kindergarten management. The strategic plan contains a strong commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and expectation for the kindergarten to enact this in practice. Kidsfirst Kindergartens Wakatipu receives ongoing, targeted and well-planned professional learning and development and is well supported by the ESM.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are for the head teacher and teachers, with the support of the ESM to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and build teachers' understanding of current theory and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed appraisal and teaching as inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refocus the philosophy and use this to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Wakatipu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Wakatipu will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>9 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
