</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scuola Montessori (15th Avenue) is a privately owned education and care service located in Tauranga. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 10 under 2 years of age. There are 54 children enrolled, 7 of whom identify as Māori. A significant number of children are from other ethnic backgrounds. Parents can access sessional or all-day care. Children learn and play in two separate age-based areas. Leaders and teachers work in partnership with Scuola Montessori in Waihi Rd. The centre was opened in October 2014 and this is its first ERO review.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by close partnerships between teachers and parents, and striving to do the best for children. Teachers aim to provide an environment that is home-like, peaceful, loving and safe. They endeavour to recognise and provide opportunities to nurture children's love of learning and responsible citizenship.</p><p>The owner fulfils the role of head directress and a new deputy head directress has recently been appointed. Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The majority have a Montessori Diploma.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Responsive, reciprocal and respectful relationships among teachers, children and their families promote a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children are engaged, and sustain play and learning through a wide range of activities. They work independently or with peers, and older children often support younger ones. Children benefit from a broad, rich curriculum, with particular strengths in literacy, mathematics and science. Children are becoming more confident and competent explorers, and are able to have fun as they play and learn.</p><p>The curriculum incorporates a strong Montessori approach as well as <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Grace and courtesy are integral to the programme, building children's respect for others and the environment. Most teachers have a sound understanding of Montessori and implement strategies to support children's learning. Their learning is also complemented by the knowledge of early childhood qualified teachers.</p><p>The programme is planned to allow children to choose, self extend and follow their own interests. There is a good balance of teachers' standing back to allow children to work uninterrupted, and engaging with children to support the development of their knowledge, skills and understandings. Teachers foster children's ability to be self-managing and independent learners. They are responsive to children with diverse needs and implement appropriate strategies to engage them in learning. All children are well supported to develop social competency and capability to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children learn in calm, quiet, well-resourced environments. Learning areas are uncluttered and easily accessed, in line with Montessori philosophy. The programme incorporates visits to the wider community and regular celebrations that allow whānau and families to share in children’s learning and success.</p><p>Children under two years of age benefit from respectful and caring relationships with teachers. Regular interactions between teachers and parents ensure consistency and continuity of care between home and the centre. These young children are well engaged and are able to make choices about their learning and play. They are settled and confidently explore the interesting, supportive learning space.</p><p>Children's progress through the Montessori curriculum is effectively tracked and monitored, allowing teachers to identify next steps for learning. Learning stories explain and celebrate learning for parents. These stories should be strengthened by more clearly and systematically documenting individual progress over time and including responses to parents' aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teachers use te reo Māori to give simple instructions and follow basic tikanga Māori. Children enthusiastically participate in waiata and karakia. Leaders and teachers agree that strengthening te ao Māori is an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Processes for transition into and within the centre are responsive to the readiness, development and needs of individual children. Time is allowed for them to become familiar with the new learning space. The centre programme promotes the development of knowledge, skills and dispositions to support transition to school. The centre has established useful relationships with nearby Montessori schools and is strengthening interactions with other local schools. Children experience positive transitions, supporting their wellbeing.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children's learning and centre activities through a variety of means. Teachers acknowledge and make good use of the skills and expertise of parents to enhance the curriculum. Parents have the opportunity to have input into regular policy reviews and an annual survey. The centre has developed effective partnerships with parents.</p><p>The head directress oversees both Scuola Montessori centres. She is well supported by a deputy head directress in each centre. The centre manager completes documentation and regulatory requirements, allowing leaders and teachers to focus on teaching and learning.</p><p>The owners have a sound policy framework in place for both centres to guide practice. Spontaneous self reviews of procedures lead to improvements in practice and outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are currently participating in professional development that is assisting them in the development of a process for planned and strategic internal evaluation. Teachers participate in a good range of professional development, including a diploma in Montessori philosophy. A meaningful appraisal process encourages teacher reflection and leads to improvements in practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre now needs to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic planning to clearly identify the centre's priorities and associated goals towards achieving its vision, particularly in relation to curriculum areas and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes, in particular the inclusion of targeted observations, with constructive feedback and feed forward about the effectiveness of teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is also a need to continue developing teachers' confidence and capability to broaden and deepen bicultural practice across the curriculum, including local iwi history and stories. This should develop the identity of Māori children in the centre more fully and provide non-Māori children with a better understanding of the rich cultural heritage of New Zealand.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scuola Montessori (15th Avenue) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scuola Montessori (15th Avenue) will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>14 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
