</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Old MacDonalds Rural Education &amp; Care Centre is a new centre located in Newstead, on the outskirts of Hamilton. It is open between 7.15am and 5.30pm and is licensed for 74 children, including up to 32 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review 102 children were enrolled. The centre offers three aged-based rooms, with the opportunity for children to move between the areas, in a new building and extensive rural grounds.</p><p>The centre is managed by the owner. The teaching teams have varying levels of early childhood experience and include primary trained teachers and untrained kaiako. There have been changes in staffing including leadership and teaching roles since opening. The Ministry of Education provided professional development and assistance, as a new centre. The facilitator was then contracted by the owner in June 2017 to provide her and the teaching team with ongoing pedagogical leadership, mentoring and support. A new staff and education manager has been appointed in January 2018.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre aims to make a difference in the lives of children and families with real, whole and heart-centred education and care.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Old MacDonalds Rural Education &amp; Care Centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The spacious, rural environment strongly supports children to explore and learn through play. Children have ready access to both indoor and outside areas. They learn about their natural world, life cycles and how to care for and respect living creatures. Curriculum experiences include:</p><ul>
<li>supervised access to a range of different farm animals</li>
<li>vegetable gardens, orchard, paddocks and, for older children, regular trips to a nearby bush area.</li>
</ul><p>Through recent professional learning and development, teachers have responded to evidence- based research and as a result recently changed their approach to a more child-led curriculum. Children now have freedom to choose, follow their interests and lead their learning.</p><p>Māori and other children experience elements of a bicultural curriculum. These include an annual Matariki celebration and hangi, natural resources, learning about legends and pepeha. Teachers incorporate the skills and expertise that Māori whānau bring to the service. Māori teaching perspectives are in the early stages of development. Teachers and leaders recognise the importance of increasing the use of te reo Māori in the programme. This is needed to assist in strengthening the bicultural perspectives and increase all children's knowledge and understanding of New Zealand's dual heritage.</p><p>Children's learning and dispositions are captured in rich, narrative learning stories. These are available for children and whānau to revisit in individual portfolios and in a digital format online. Teachers have recently explored the use of a Māori framework to assess children's learning. There is more work required by teachers to fully embed this process. Further consideration should now also be given to the documentation of planning, evaluating the progress of children's learning over time and capturing and celebrating the language, culture and identity of all children.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years' experience responsive caregiving through strong and secure attachments to a primary care teacher. Teachers understand the concept of aroha, including compassion, respect and connectedness. Feeding and sleep rhythms are individualised.  Infants and toddlers have the freedom to explore their indoor and outdoor environment and have opportunities to play and learn alongside older siblings. These young children's care needs are well met in a calm and settled environment.</p><p>Teachers and leaders establish strong, respectful relationships with children and their whānau. Children’s rights to express a point of view and be involved in decisions that affect them are upheld, and they are increasingly empowered to take responsibility for their own wellbeing. There is a range of attentive teaching practices that respond to children’s interests and provide valuable learning opportunities. Children with additional learning and health needs are well supported. Transitions into and within the centre are individualised in response to each child's readiness and parents' aspirations. Leaders and teachers have made links with local schools and are strengthening transition-to-school partnerships. Children develop a sense of belonging and confidence through trusting relationships with adults at the centre.</p><p>Leadership is underpinned by relational trust, critical reflection and valuing partnerships. Teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles.  Leaders and teachers have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>A well-understood vision and philosophy guides all aspects of centre operation. The strategic appointment of a pedagogical leader has supported the staff to focus on improvement in learning and teaching through a time of change. Comprehensive self-review processes are well embedded and are leading to improved learning outcomes for children. Teachers feel supported and valued and have a shared ownership of the strategic direction and philosophy for the centre. Closer alignment of the annual plan to the strategic goals is likely to promote a more focused approach to centre and curriculum development. Generous provision of professional learning and development supports teachers to more fully implement the centre's philosophy. Children benefit from a governance focused on quality systems, practices and continual improvement. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Old MacDonalds Rural Education &amp; Care Centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>fully embed the new assessment process and strengthen the recording of planning and evaluation of children's learning and development to show progress over time, and capture the language, culture and identity of all children</li>
<li>strengthen the bicultural curriculum and increase use of te reo Māori to further support Māori children's sense of belonging and identity as successful learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Old MacDonalds Rural Education &amp; Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practise centre management need to continue to closely monitor health and safety procedures. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Old MacDonalds Rural Education &amp; Care Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</p><p>19 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
