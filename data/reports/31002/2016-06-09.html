</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Arohena Playcentre is a parent-led centre that experiences strong community support. It is located in attractive rural surroundings next to Arohena School. The centre aims to offer a service where parents are involved in providing quality early childhood education for children.</p><p>The playcentre operates under the umbrella of King Country Playcentre Association to provide education and care for children from birth to school age. Centre members receive ongoing support and advice from a centre support staff member employed by the association. The centre provides two morning sessions weekly. It is licensed to for 25 children to attend, including a maximum of 10 children up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 17 children were enrolled, of whom six are identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre caters for a diverse community of parents, who are mostly employed to work on local farms. Parents share responsibility for centre management and leadership. Since the 2012 ERO review, parents have continued to complete playcentre education courses that enhance their understanding of children's learning and their role as parent educators. Bicultural perspectives have been considerably strengthened. Self review has had a greater focus, and has led to the playground being extended and improved. The centre has also continued to be involved in community events.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the King Country Playcentre Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the positive, family-like culture of the centre. They are involved in a wide range of interesting and inviting activities and experiences for play and learning. They enjoy playing alongside others, developing friendships and extending their social skills. Children aged up to two are included in the programme. Their mothers and whƒÅnau are well supported by other adults, who enjoy interacting with babies and young toddlers.</p><p>Parents work alongside children who are encouraged to follow their interests. Children's oral language is supported by conversations, as parents listen to their ideas and prompt their thinking and problem solving. Literacy and numeracy are natural parts of the programme. Children particularly enjoy books read to them at morning tea time, and have easy access to equipment and resources that help them to explore their ideas.</p><p>Parents benefit from their participation in playcentre activities and events as they become part of the playcentre and wider district community. They receive up-to-date information about the nutritional needs of children that helps them to make informed choices about their children's food. Children's health and wellbeing is promoted through parents' provision of healthy food for morning tea and the active play encouraged in the redeveloped outdoor playground.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to including aspects of MƒÅori as an integral part of the programme. The skills of parents who are fluent speakers of MƒÅori contribute to the natural integration of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. Adults have provided costumes and equipment for children's waiata and kapa haka performances within the centre.</p><p>The centre has a close relationship with Arohena School that supports children's transition from the centre. Playcentre children visit the school and attend school events, and senior school students visit the centre as part of their studies.</p><p>Children each have an individual portfolio containing regular entries that identify children's participation and learning during their time at playcentre. They document a variety of activities and events, in and beyond the centre. Some examples show the development and progress of their learning and interests. Experienced parents contribute to some portfolios.</p><p>Parents plan and evaluate the programme for each term. They recognise the benefits of allowing children to lead, follow their interests and choose their own activities. At the end of each session the programme is evaluated by the supervision team to provide direction for the next session's activities.</p><p>Strong leadership is provided by centre and community personnel. The centre president has undertaken training that has given her an understanding of playcentre philosophy and policy. A long-serving community volunteer provides support to develop the environment and its focus on meeting the social and educational needs of parents and their children. Leaders have taken a sensitive approach, which has encouraged parents to undertake playcentre parent education courses. The association supports this process through the provision of on-site talks and assistance with course work.</p><p>The centre's strategic plan reflects the goals of the association and developments within the centre. The centre has extended the number of families attending the centre to improve its sustainability. There has been an emphasis on developing the parent cooperative culture of the service and the capacity of new members to contribute their skills. Centre members need to continue to encourage each other to be involved in centre decision making as they grow in their understanding of children's early learning.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association continue to provide good quality governance and management for this centre. The association provides comprehensive policies and guidelines, and employs a centre support person, who assists families to operate the service in the best interests of children and their parents and whƒÅnau. The benefits of</p><p>this support would be made more evident if a process was introduced to provide formal reports on the quality of centre programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre agreed that next steps for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>adding written annotations on children's art work that record their ideas and stories and recognise how their skills are developing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for older children, writing assessments of their progress in developing early literacy and numeracy skills in individual portfolios.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Arohena Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Arohena Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>9 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
