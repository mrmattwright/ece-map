</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kuiti Playcentre is a parent-led centre located in Te Kuiti, providing education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for a maximum of 30 children, including 15 children up to two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 16 children enrolled, two of whom identify as MƒÅori and two of Cook Island descent. Currently there are three mixed-age sessions a week, led and managed by parents committed to the playcentre and its philosophy.</p><p>The playcentre operates under the umbrella of King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA). The centre is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF), which provide the centre with effective governance, strategic direction, management support and adult education programmes. The centre's practice is based on the guiding principles of the NZPF philosophy. These principles include a commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi and values productive partnerships with MƒÅori.</p><p>The programme places strong emphasis on children and parents learning together through play, in a safe and supportive environment. Members aim to build a strong sense of belonging in the community for children and adults and assist children to develop as socially competent and confident learners.</p><p>This centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and responded well to the areas identified in the 2013 report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the King Country Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in learning and play activities that cater for a wide range of interests and ages. They have many opportunities to choose and explore their interests alongside parents and whƒÅnau. They enjoy playing alongside others, developing friendships and extending their social skills.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are fully integrated into all aspects of the programme. Their mothers and whƒÅnau are well supported by other adults, who enjoy interacting with each other's children in a family-like environment. The mixed-age sessions encourage older children to learn patience and tolerance as they play alongside the younger children. Tuakana-teina learning is evident through older role modelling oral language, physical challenges and social competencies.</p><p>Children benefit from respectful and reciprocal relationships in an environment where parents and families know each other well. The high ratio of adults to children enables rich oral language and opportunities where children's talk is encouraged, accepted and respected. Adults listen to and extend children's vocabulary, and use open-ended questions to further develop their language development and communication skills.</p><p>Children have access to all resources, which empowers them to initiate their own play and explore their ideas. Mathematics is promoted through meaningful and interesting opportunities that enable children to experiment, investigate and problem solve. Children's early literacy skills are fostered through actively participating in storytelling, developing a love of books, and through creative and imaginative play. Mat time provides flexible routines as well as providing time for families to enjoy music, singing and dancing together.</p><p>The outdoor area is spacious, attractive and deliberately planned to offer physical challenges for all age groups. Parents set up the environment to invite children to practice their gross motor skills and redesign the environment to sustain their interests and extend their play. A next step for the centre is to have a planned approach to further build on the concepts about the natural world, linking this to children's interests. This approach should further enhance their understanding of science concepts.</p><p>Te reo MƒÅori is being included in the programme as parents build their knowledge and gain confidence. Centre members are engaged with ongoing professional development provided by the Maniapoto Marae Trust to continue to build their knowledge, understanding and daily use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to ensuring smooth transitions to school and is currently part of a Ministry of Education initiative 'Curriculum and Transition to School'. This initiative is focused on further strengthening relationships between parents and schools and developing transition packs for parents and children.</p><p>All adults are currently engaged in playcentre education programmes that empower them to actively take a positive and more confident role in the development and education of their children. Parents plan and evaluate the programme regularly. They recognise the benefits of allowing children to lead their learning and choose their own activities. A next step is to review the planning and evaluation process, and build on the strong examples in the centre that show how parents are adding complexity to individual children's ideas and interests over time.</p><p>Members maintain a collaborative approach to leadership. Self review is well understood and valued. Leaders use this to develop a strategic plan to guide ongoing development and improvement. Regular playcentre meetings include reflective discussions that lead to improvements for children's play and learning. There is a positive approach to succession planning, fostering emergent leadership, building on individual strengths and supporting those in new roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association continue to provide good quality governance and management for this centre. The association provides comprehensive policies and guidelines, and employs a centre support person who assists families to operate the service in the best interests of children and their parents and whƒÅnau. The benefits of this support would be made more evident if a process was introduced to provide formal reports on the quality of centre programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The playcentre and ERO agree that the next steps for the service are to work with the association centre support person to review and strengthen the purpose of individual portfolios to ensure they clearly identify children's learning and progress, and allow children to revisit and share their experiences.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kuiti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to legislative and health and safety requirements. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the outside shed provides accessibility to resources for children as well as meeting the health and safety standards and regulations (regulation 45)<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kuiti Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>5 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
