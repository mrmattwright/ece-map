<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Green Island Kindergarten is one of 22 kindergartens that are under the umbrella of Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). The kindergarten is across the street from the Green Island Primary School. The teachers, with the support of an active parent committee, have spent the last year settling into a new purpose-built facility on the kindergarten site. Since this development they have a larger teaching team and are licensed for a greater number of children from 8:30am to 2:30pm daily.</p><p align="left">The rebuild process over the past 2 years has strengthened relationships with kindergarten families and the community. Children have settled well into the new environment. The kindergarten is attractive and inviting. Children are familiar with kindergarten routines and enjoy the use of a wide range of resources and equipment.</p><p align="left">Just prior to ERO&rsquo;s visit the final member of the permanent teaching team had been appointed. Since then teachers have focused on developing the culture of the kindergarten and finalising systems to support and monitor children&rsquo;s learning. Some review practices have helped teachers see what they need to do next.</p><p align="left">Features observed that benefit children include:</p><ul>
<li>the warm, supportive relationships children and families have with the teachers</li>
<li>the teachers&rsquo; learning conversations with children that support and promote children&rsquo;s sense of belonging, social skills and independence</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; support for and promotion of the children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the spacious child-friendly learning environment</li>
<li>the way children play cooperatively together, are enthusiastic about their learning and engage meaningfully for long periods of time.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The teachers and senior advisors are aware of the kindergarten&rsquo;s next steps for review and development. These include better planning for individual children and making the teachers&rsquo; role more visible in documentation, bicultural development and self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Green Island Kindergarten provided documentation to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined. ERO focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Green Island Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">The new environment required a number of changes to the kindergarten&rsquo;s routines and procedures. Teachers have been working with the new team members to establish these and build shared understandings about programme development and teaching practice.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Settling into the new facility. Since moving into the new building the teachers have reviewed policies and procedures and undertaken relicensing. They have been working on ways to have more involvement from parents in the learning programme. Teachers have revisited the assessment process and how they document learning. They have planned and begun to implement M&#257;ori perspectives and bicultural practices. They are beginning to establish self-review processes and practices that work for them as a team and that support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Learning and teaching.Children benefit from the friendly, welcoming environment the teachers have created for them and their families. Teachers have meaningful conversations about learning with parents and gather information about parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children. The children are becoming familiar with New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage as teachers implement planned strategies to achieve objectives around biculturalism.</p><p align="left">Other aspects of teaching and learning at the kindergarten that promote positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>the way teachers use the children&rsquo;s interests to build their social skills and how they provide a range of experiences and activities where social skills can be put into practice</li>
<li>the variety of effective teaching strategies used to empower children, promote leadership and build the children&rsquo;s independence</li>
<li>the teachers&rsquo; use of questioning to promote children&rsquo;s thinking, problem-solving and decision making, and to give teachers an understanding of the child&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers act as facilitators of children&rsquo;s plans and ideas. They are skilful in supporting dramatic play and extending literacy and mathematical learning. Children value, enjoy and seek to be involved in literacy and mathematics related activities.</p><p align="left">The group learning focus at the time of ERO&rsquo;s visit was respect. Teachers consistently promote this learning by integrating it through the day and across curriculum areas.</p><p align="left">Learning stories show teachers know children&rsquo;s interests and support and extend these. A common learning focus is children&rsquo;s social development. Stories show that teachers encourage the development of leadership skills and promote children&rsquo;s creative development. Profile books capture the child&rsquo;s voice and show progress with learning. Some evaluations of learning also include the role of the teacher and the way they contributed to the learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The teachers have made good progress settling into the new environment. With the appointment of permanent staff, many of the new systems and processes are only now being embedded. However, with support from Dunedin Kindergartens senior advisors, these systems may be effective in supporting and promoting children&rsquo;s learning. The teachers are aware of their next steps. These include:</p><ul>
<li>planning and evaluating programmes to promote individual learning</li>
<li>extending bicultural practices and the further integration of Maori perspectives</li>
<li>strengthening self-review practices, including the development of a schedule for review that covers all aspects of operation and teaching and learning over time, the review of the kindergarten philosophy and the review of all aspects of the afternoon programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Green Island Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The kindergarten is across the street from the Green Island Primary School. The teachers, with the support of an active parent committee, have spent the last year settling into a new purpose-built facility on the kindergarten site. Since this development they have a larger teaching team and are licensed for a greater number of children from 8:30am to 2:30pm daily.</p><p align="left">The rebuild process over the past 2 years has strengthened relationships with kindergarten families and the community. Children have settled well into the new environment. The kindergarten is attractive and inviting. Children are familiar with kindergarten routines and enjoy the use of a wide range of resources and equipment.</p><p align="left">Just prior to ERO&rsquo;s visit the final member of the permanent teaching team had been appointed. Since then teachers have focused on developing the culture of the kindergarten and finalising systems to support and monitor children&rsquo;s learning. Some review practices have helped teachers see what they need to do next.</p><p align="left">Features observed that benefit children include:</p><ul>
<li>the warm, supportive relationships children and families have with the teachers</li>
<li>the teachers&rsquo; learning conversations with children that support and promote children&rsquo;s sense of belonging, social skills and independence</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; support for and promotion of the children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the spacious child-friendly learning environment</li>
<li>the way children play cooperatively together, are enthusiastic about their learning and engage meaningfully for long periods of time.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The teachers and senior advisors are aware of the kindergarten&rsquo;s next steps for review and development. These include better planning for individual children and making the teachers&rsquo; role more visible in documentation, bicultural development and self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
