</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators @ Waipa Christian Kindergarten is a privately owned education and care service located in the Waikato township of Te Awamutu. It caters for children between the ages of two and five. It is licensed for 40 children. There are currently 48 children on the roll, six of whom are Māori. The centre operates two rooms, one for children between two and three and one for those from three to five. The centre operates a full day service from 8.00am until 4.00pm each week day.</p><p>An effectively documented philosophy and learning model are underpinned by Christian beliefs and the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. The philosophy states that 'children are uniquely created in the image of God, full of wonder and potential, constructing their own knowledge.'</p><p>The Centre is governed and managed by Creators Educational Trust, which owns and operates a number of early childhood services in Hamilton and the Waikato. Day-to-day operations are led by an experienced manager who is well supported by the trust. Most teachers at the centre are fully qualified.</p><p>The centre is two and a half years old and this is its first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive, nurturing relationships with teachers, who respect their rights and talk with them about decisions that affect them. They benefit from a learning model that emphasises the centrality of the child, the value of listening to children's talk and discussion, as a way of promoting their ongoing exploration of the world. Children are provided with rich experiences that promote key competencies such as working collaboratively, higher order thinking and good oral language. Children also have many opportunities to solve problems and experiment. Children's knowledge and learning is extended through experiences that promote sustainability, social and self-managing skills, which are delivered though a Christian world view.</p><p>There is a useful framework to guide teachers to notice, recognise and respond to individual and groups of children. Individual learning plans for children, developed in consultation with children and parents, create the potential for teachers to respond meaningfully to each child's strengths, interests, and development priorities. An inquiry approach to the teacher-led component of the curriculum provides teachers with a framework for developing provocations and projects for children that encourage them to explore their world and develop their thinking. Children are given many opportunities to revisit their learning via attractive individual learning portfolios and high quality teacher produced resources. Smooth transitions for children turning five are promoted by a close relationship between the centre and the neighbouring school.</p><p>Teachers value the contribution of parents and whānau, and provide many opportunities for them to become involved in the daily programme.</p><p>A clear strategic vision for the centre is evident, which recognises the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand and states a commitment to equity and social justice. Children are developing knowledge and understanding of New Zealand's dual cultural heritage.</p><p>Trust leaders have developed well thought out processes for building the organisational culture of the centre. These include a strong induction programme, regular mentoring, and focussed professional development. A comprehensive, high quality policy framework provides guidance for teachers in all aspects of centre operations.</p><p>Self review and teacher performance appraisal have been linked in a way which strengthens both processes, and ensures that all staff have the opportunity to be involved in creating initiatives leading to improvement. Children are benefiting from the outcomes of self review particularly in relation to the learning environment, music, and the natural world.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Strengthen planning for individual children by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing learning partnerships with parents to more meaningfully contribute to children's goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening systems for monitoring and tracking how teachers are responding to children’s goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that responding to children’s goals is a central component of programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reporting more intentionally on children’s progress against their goals in learning portfolios.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Continue to strengthen the inclusion of Māori perspectives and knowledge in the daily programme by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing a bicultural framework to underpin the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>researching ways in which Māori perspectives of the child and development that can be incorporated in to teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a systematic approach to the teaching of local iwi, community history, and traditions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review ERO observed teachers operating in a more teacher directed, whole-group approach to programme delivery. It is now time to revisit the centre philosophy and learning model, with teachers, and develop clear, agreed expectations for how the individual child-led aspect of their philosophy is fully enacted. In addition, leaders need to support teachers to be more accountable in delivering the curriculum that is clearly expressed in the philosophy.</p><p>Strengthen teacher performance management by including an observation component to the appraisal system which also includes high quality formative feedback.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators @ Waipa Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creators @ Waipa Christian Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato / Bay of Plenty</p><h3>19 June 2017</h3><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
