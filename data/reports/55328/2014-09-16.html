</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paikea Kindergarten provides six-hour education and care Monday to Thursday for up to twenty children between two and five years old. It is located in the district of Whangara, Gisborne. The teaching team of two experienced, fully registered teachers is supported by two teacher aides.</p><p>This is a first review for Paikea Kindergarten. This early childhood service was previously known as Paikea Preschool. In September 2013, Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) took over the governance of the preschool. Paikea Preschool had a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>A new kindergarten facility was erected on the grounds of Whangara School. Information, resources and children‚Äôs journals of learning were respectfully incorporated into the new kindergarten, building on the richness of the preschool‚Äôs past.</p><p>Since opening, the association has provided professional support for teachers focusing on assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to the philosophy which is reflected in teaching practice. It is supported and understood by the wider community.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the association. Two senior teachers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergartens in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, their whƒÅnau, family and the community are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten‚Äôs well organised learning spaces. Children are invited to explore individually or in self chosen groups, to wonder and to be creative. A sense of belonging is clearly evident.</p><p>MƒÅori children are very well supported to achieve success as MƒÅori. Teachers demonstrate a high level of commitment to consulting whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children and involving them in decision-making and curriculum implementation.</p><p>Teachers appreciate and clearly understand family aspirations and expectations for each child. They work with families in responsive and deliberate ways to support progress and success.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value that language, culture and identity are key to the development of self worth. Using local te reo MƒÅori and tikanga practices, children learn through culture.</p><p>Bicultural aspects of the curriculum are highly evident. Teachers' close connection with the wider community, whƒÅnau, hapu and iwi strengthens their knowledge of te ao MƒÅori, preparing them to teach more effectively.</p><p>Teachers articulate and demonstrate that children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for what they know. Children play and learn within a curriculum that is responsive to individual requirements for toddlers and young children. Routines are sociable occasions and provide a clear framework for the day.</p><p>There are many opportunities for children to be leaders. They support each other through wellestablished tuakana teina relationships. Staff deliberately work with children to challenge their learning through meaningful conversations and interactions.</p><p>Group planning is responsive to children‚Äôs interests and used to provide extension to the programme. Assessment, planning and evaluation are well understood. Children‚Äôs progress over time is illustrated in the ‚ÄòJournals of Learning'. Teachers continually strengthen the way they include whƒÅnau in assessment practices.</p><p>Literacy learning is thoughtfully integrated. Children‚Äôs mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use these concepts in everyday life. Teachers‚Äô commitment to reflect on the mathematics programmes should further strengthen children‚Äôs mathematical learning.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are fully accepted and supported by adults and other children. All children are observed as happy and successful. Where appropriate, teachers liaise with external agencies.</p><p>Pacific children‚Äôs individual identity is valued and supported by teachers incorporating their language and culture into the programme.</p><p>The head teacher's collaborative leadership is improvement focused. ERO agrees that continual learning about self review should support ongoing improvements for children.</p><p>Transition to school processes are fostered through children‚Äôs friendships and engagement in school activities planned to enhance their confidence and security as they near school age. Leaders have appropriately identified that they should continue to strengthen this process over time.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust guiding documents and comprehensive policies</li>
<li>clear expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations including health and safety practices</li>
<li>strong leadership</li>
<li>professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound supporting processes for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association and use this information to inform decision-making. They should also support teachers to build their evaluative capacity to regularly inquire into the effectiveness of their practice to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Since the first ERO cluster review of kindergartens in the association, the appraisal process has been reviewed. A revised approach is beginning to be put into practice and formal documentation is developing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that the key next step is to refine evaluative practices.</p><p>The association's key next step should include undertaking formal strategic self review at association level.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paikea Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paikea Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>16 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
