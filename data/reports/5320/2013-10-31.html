</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Irmgard Ritchie Kindergarten is located in Upper Hutt and caters for children aged from two to five years. It is an all-day centre and licensed for 40 children. At the time of this review 48 children, including 11 MƒÅori, are enrolled</p><p>The teaching team comprises a head teacher, four teachers and a teacher aide.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) governs the kindergarten effectively, and provides senior teacher support. The association is committed to maintaining 100% of teachers being qualified. Clear policy guidelines outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operations.</p><p>The philosophy celebrates the cultural diversity of New Zealand. The teaching team values an environment where children actively explore alongside others. Teachers plan programmes where children can learn about social relationships, respect for others, self-help skills and being flexible in today‚Äôs changing world.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. This review is part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is highly evident in practice. The team values and provides a welcoming and challenging environment where children actively explore alongside others.</p><p>Teachers establish strong partnerships with families who contribute to the programme. Teachers have identified that while they seek and respond to the aspirations of parents for their children when planning and writing learning stories, they need to be more consistent. ERO‚Äôs external evaluation affirms this as a next step for development.</p><p>Since the May 2010 ERO report, there has been a significant improvement in assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Staff are participating in the association assessment project and note the impact of the different assessment tools used. Planning is appropriately based on noticing and documenting children‚Äôs learning and interests. Teachers show well how they will support and encourage children to extend their learning. Evaluations clearly identify what went well and inform next steps for planning. Attractive visual displays communicate the programme to parents. Portfolios provide a clear record of children‚Äôs learning. Frequent links between stories track this learning. Next steps are well identified. There is a high level of parent and child input.</p><p>Children engage in a programme where their experiences are extended beyond the immediate environment. Regular trips into the wider community and visitors to the kindergarten reflect parent aspirations and increase children‚Äôs knowledge of the local and wider community. Early literacy and numeracy feature strongly in the programme.</p><p>As an outcome of review, the environment is well maintained and presented. Well-considered and resourced activity areas promote uninterrupted free play, invite exploration and allow children to challenge themselves. Learning through the natural world is valued.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum supports MƒÅori children to learn about their language, culture and identity. Te reo MƒÅori, tikanga and culture are celebrated through te reo sessions run by a parent and strongly supported by teachers. Teachers have identified what success for MƒÅori, as MƒÅori means to them as a team. They are working positively to provide a programme that reflects a focus on this.</p><p>Successful strategies to support Pacific children are integrated into the programme. Children are greeted in their own language. Teachers incorporate Pacific cultural resources, celebrations, music and posters into the curriculum in meaningful contexts.</p><p>Children with special learning needs are well supported. Teachers in partnership with parents prepare individual learning plans. Sound goals are set and regularly monitored. Routines and practices are reviewed to ensure children participate in the programme at their own level with suitable resources. External agencies are appropriately involved in planning.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective teaching strategies. Questioning is well used to promote thinking and extend play. Teachers set problems for children to solve, build on their home experiences and prior learning, and model language of play. Children are encouraged to lead their own learning and set personal goals.</p><p>The head teacher provides effective leadership. The strengths of each team member are valued. Teachers are encouraged to be innovative, engage in professional discussion and take on opportunities for leadership roles. Association strategic and annual plans guide development. They regularly monitor progress of their own goals. Ongoing use of evaluation and rigorous self review sustain and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well targeted, ongoing support and guidance to teachers. They promote regular professional development opportunities and useful systems that are focused on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The 2012 appraisal process was well implemented with feedback to teachers that affirms good practice and identifies areas for ongoing improvement and development. Goal setting for the recently implemented 2013 appraisal has been completed and linked to professional development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Irmgard Ritchie Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Irmgard Ritchie Kindergarten will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>31 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
