</table><p>Le Malelega a le To'elau ECE Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Le Malelega a le To'elau ECE Centre is a community based, bilingual Samoan centre. It is governed by The Fountain of Knowledge Trust Board. The centre provides care and education for up to 50 children, with a maximum of 15 children up to 2 years of age. Most of the children identify as Samoan.</p><p>The philosophy acknowledges the importance of children learning through their Samoan culture and language in play. It acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi and MƒÅori as tƒÅngata whenua. Supporting children's holistic development using <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and fa'a Samoa, is valued.</p><p>The board employs an administrator, financial manager, and six qualified teachers, including the executive director and professional service manager (PSM). Most of the teaching team are new since ERO's 2015 review, and are recent graduates. The board has delegated the executive director to oversee centre governance and management. The PSM provides curriculum leadership and practice for the teaching team.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified areas for development in emerging leadership, and the use of internal evaluation to improve the programme. The board has responded well to these areas for development. Staff turnover has identified other priorities for the new team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a programme that is embedded in the centre philosophy and supports their sense of belonging and wellbeing. They learn the values of fa'aaloalo (respect), alofa (love) and tautua (service) through gagana and fa'a Samoa. Children use te reo MƒÅori and learn aspects of tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Leaders ensure that children with additional learning needs receive very good individualised support, with parent, teachers and external agency involvement. Children's social competence, oral language, and physical development are well supported in a positive environment.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' self-help skills and sense of belonging, are well promoted through primary caregiving and consistent routines. Adults provide nurturing and caring interactions in a calm setting. Teachers support children's transitions well. Infants and toddlers have good opportunities to explore at their own pace, to play alongside their peers, and to interact with the older children.</p><p>The PSM provides curriculum leadership, and modelling of effective teaching practice to develop a shared understanding of the centre vision and philosophy. Teachers access a variety of relevant external and internal professional learning and development (PLD). Leaders are supporting teachers to develop their reflective practice, and are poised to undertake staff PLD in <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and Reggio Emilia. This should support the team to strengthen the learning programme in response to individual children's needs, and to extend their learning through play. A planned review of the centre environment should also support this goal.</p><p>Leaders very effectively promote and contribute to the centre's community and the early childhood profession nationally. They have good links with the local school's Samoan bilingual unit and contribute to bilingual forums. Leaders implement meaningful teacher appraisal processes and continue to build teachers' capability in intentional teaching and reflective practice. They agree that they should strengthen teachers' induction programme and appraisal links to the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p><p>The board is very effective in its role. The executive director reports regularly to the board, and implements strong processes of internal evaluation to identify centre goals and sustain ongoing improvement. The board make good use of parent voice to inform internal evaluation, and are implementing plans to upgrade the outdoor environment. The centre has relevant systems and processes for health and safety management.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that priorities for improving outcomes for children include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve the learning environment through professional learning to increase children's learning opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote intentional teaching and reflective practice to increase teachers' capability to respond to and extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen learning-focused partnerships with parents.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Le Malelega a le To'elau ECE Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>11 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
