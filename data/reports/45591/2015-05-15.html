</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Le Malelega a le To‚Äôelau ECE centre is a bilingual Samoan centre in Mangere, Auckland. It has been operating since 2010 under the Fountain of Knowledge Trust Board. The centre is a modern, purpose-built building on spacious grounds that also accommodate a further, separate early childhood facility. The centre provides separate indoor and outdoor spaces for the children who are under three and for those over three years of age. The centre environment is attractive, inviting and strongly reflects its unique Samoan character.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 50 children, including a maximum of 15 children up to the age of two years. The centre mission statement and philosophy embraces children‚Äôs success. It does this by developing children‚Äôs sense of identity and emphasising children‚Äôs Samoan culture and language. The centre values children‚Äôs holistic development. It provides a child-sensitive, interactive programme. The philosophy is strongly evident in the centre‚Äôs practice.</p><p>The experienced centre manager and supervisor are long serving staff. Together with the board and staff they share a commitment to the underpinning philosophy of the centre. There is a culture of high expectations for children and staff. The board supports high quality professional development for staff and maintains a high percentage of qualified teachers. Qualified staff have the assistance of four teacher aides and an administrator.</p><p>This is the second ERO review of Le Malelega a le To‚Äôelau ECE Centre. The board and managers have embedded the strengths evident at the time of the 2012 ERO review. There has been very good progress in the areas that were identified for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing care in a calm and relaxing environment. They are comfortable in their surroundings. Teachers are flexible in their responses, constantly interact with the babies and have a good knowledge of them and the toddlers. Children enjoy variety in their play, including indoor and outdoor experiences and opportunities to mix with older children.</p><p>Children show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They are well supported to settle. Teachers liaise closely with parents to provide appropriate care and to support children‚Äôs transitions into the centre, through the centre and on to school. Teachers are respectful of children‚Äôs choices and follow their lead.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô professional development has had a positive impact on improving outcomes for children. Play is valued as key to children‚Äôs learning. Teachers use interactive teaching approaches and provoke children‚Äôs exploration and thinking by setting up the environment to encourage play. Staff and children have fun in the process of learning. Teachers emphasise developing children‚Äôs oral language and social skills. They recognise the value of continuing to review how well the programme supports children‚Äôs complex play.</p><p>Children engage in play that builds on their interests. They spend much of their day exploring a range of play areas. There is a commitment to providing children with high quality equipment and resources. Children have many opportunities to lead, talk about and revisit their play. Teachers integrate literacy, numeracy, science and some te reo MƒÅori throughout the programme. Continuing to strengthen the bicultural curriculum will help reflect the unique place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p>The centre manager and supervisor provide effective curriculum leadership. Children‚Äôs records of learning increasingly show how children have progressed in an area of interest. Parents contribute ideas to the programme. They also provide feedback in their children‚Äôs learning portfolios. The teaching team collaboratively plan, assess and evaluate the programme. They should continue to build on the very good models of teaching practice within the centre. This will assist them to strengthen team capability and develop shared curriculum leadership.</p><p>A culture of continual improvement is promoted by centre managers. They are supporting teachers to develop their understanding of self review. Teachers are increasingly reflective about their practice and this is contributing to a more robust process of appraisal. Teachers review the curriculum using an inquiry approach to improve their teaching practice. Their professional development is relevant to the centre‚Äôs philosophy and strategic goals. Teachers are committed to engaging in research-based learning about effective bilingual teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The Trust works collaboratively to govern the centre and it aims to provide a high quality service for children and their families. It implements sound planning that is informed by self review. Appropriate documentation including policies, procedures and strategic and annual planning, form a framework for the operation of the centre. There are good systems and processes in place to assure the board of the centre‚Äôs strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that the next steps for the centre include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the use of self review to make ongoing improvements to the programme</li>
<li>emerging leadership amongst teachers</li>
<li>the extent to which the programme reflects the bicultural principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Le Malelega a le To'elau ECE Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Le Malelega a le To'elau ECE Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>15 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
