</table><p>ABC Parklands with the support of BestStart managers is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Parklands is owned and operated by the BestStart Group. The service provides full-day education and care for up to 50 children aged from three months to school age. Infants and toddlers have separate indoor and outdoor areas. A preschool room caters for older children.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been significant staffing changes. This includes teaching staff, a new centre manager and most recently a new BestStart Professional Services Manager. At the time of this review, the centre was actively recruiting new staff. The staff changes have impacted on the service's ability to fully address the recommendations outlined in the 2013 ERO report.</p><p>The centre manager manages the day-to-day operations. There is a team leader for the nursery and an acting team leader in the preschool. A BestStart business manager and BestStart professional services manager visit regularly to support the service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six centre reviews in the BestStart Group in Canterbury.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre leader, with the support of the BestStart managers have created a centre culture that supports a teaching team that is collaborative and motivated.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have used a framework for ongoing evaluation and development of aspects of the centre's programmes and practices. For example, there are now smoother transitions for children between the nursery and preschool. Service leaders and the centre manager have identified that the framework for internal evaluation needs to be strengthened to be more effective.</p><p>This includes being more evaluative (asking "how well...?") and making better use of indicators at all stages of the evaluation.</p><p>The centre philosophy affirms the importance of respectful relationships and this is evident in practice. Learning records show teachers fostering positive relationships with children and their whānau. With staff changes it is timely to review and redevelop the philosophy to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly state the centre's desired outcomes for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include key Māori values relevant to the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The philosophy could be used more meaningfully to guide curriculum decisions and internal evaluation.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a small group size that enables a calm and settled atmosphere. Teachers have responsive, nurturing relationships with the children. Parents and teachers regularly share information about children's changing needs. Teachers use this information to create individualised routines. Recent professional learning has led to a programme that increasingly:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>is responsive to the learning and care requirements of infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fosters and supports children's interests and active exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognises children's diverse cultural backgrounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes opportunities for children to hear te reo Māori, waiata and experience tikanga Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The mixed-age grouping in the preschool allows older children to support and care for younger children as they play and learn. Teachers have adapted the programme to better respond to the increased numbers of younger children. As a result of parent feedback, the outdoor environment has been enhanced with equipment that provides greater physical challenge for children. Learning records show teachers knowing and responding to children's interests, fostering friendships and supporting them as they prepare to transition to school. A wide range of community and cultural events are celebrated. These are used to create a sense of belonging and community for children and whānau within the centre. Teachers include some te reo Māori. They are aware that this is an area to further develop.</p><p>The centre leaders and BestStart managers have been improving systems for planning, assessment and evaluation for groups and individual children. They agree this still needs to be further developed and strengthened.</p><p>Planning for individual children needs to show more clearly how teachers have worked in partnership with parents to determine the next learning steps for their children, and show how learning progresses over time. Teachers need to clearly identify priorities for learning in group planning and the strategies they will use to support this. They should ensure evaluations show what learning has occurred and how effective the experiences and strategies have been in supporting learning.</p><p>There are well-developed systems and processes in place to help services achieve the BestStart’s expectations for high quality education and care. This includes regular monitoring and support for the quality of practice (identifying what is going well and what the centre needs to do next to improve). A strengthened appraisal system leading to greater reflection is in place and would be further enhanced by making links to Tātaiako (cultural competencies). Professional learning is promoted at all levels of the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree the next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify the service's desired outcomes for children's learning within the philosophy and use this to guide curriculum priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation by using an evaluative question and use relevant indicators to guide the evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the new appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Parklands completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Parklands will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu Southern</p><p>14 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
