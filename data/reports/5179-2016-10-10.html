</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Huntly operates under the umbrella of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). The kindergarten is licensed to cater for 40 children from two years to school age. A high proportion of children enrolled are Māori. The kindergarten is open from 8.45am to 3.00pm, five days a week.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, staffing has remained consistent. Teachers have responded positively to the areas identified for improvement in the 2013 ERO report. They have reviewed and significantly improved the learning environment. Teachers have participated in professional development and as a result, strategically reviewed the bicultural programme and ways to affirm Māori children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is based on the concept of whanaungatanga and child-initiated play. Teachers value working in partnership with parents and whānau. The environment provides equitable learning opportunities for all children.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the CNIKT. The trust’s strategic direction sets out the service’s vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust works positively to provide equitable opportunities for families by extending its hours of opening and working with them to support appropriately, and are very responsive when needed.</p><p>Compliance and regulatory requirements are well monitored by professional leaders. Policies and procedures support the kindergarten to meet regulation requirements and management expectations. The professional leaders work alongside head teachers to support them in their leadership roles and provide guidance, and mentor teachers as part of the appraisal process. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>Personnel matters are well managed. The trust has undertaken a long-term review of teacher appraisal in consultation with teachers. This is enabling them to respond to the expectations of the Education Council and increase the depth of teachers’ reflections about their practice. The trust has also responded effectively to the Vulnerable Children’s Act, and is well placed to complete required changes to policies and practices for the protection of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergarten - Huntly is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children are capable learners. They are encouraged to develop independent care skills, to make decisions, and take informed risks. Children are developing independent care skills and confidence to lead their own learning. There are extensive opportunities for children to engage in sustained and complex learning. Teachers notice children's interests and very skilfully respond to potential learning opportunities. Intentional teaching strategies encourage children to problem solve, reflect and inquire. Through active exploration and discovery children have unrushed time to develop their knowledge, understanding and thinking skills.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics, and other curriculum areas are effectively interwoven into children's play. The environment is purposefully prepared to stimulate children's curiosity and interest. Children can revisit prior learning and build on their own understanding and knowledge about their interests.</p><p>Children and their whānau are warmly welcomed into a homely and inclusive kindergarten environment. Transitions into the kindergarten are sensitively managed, flexible, and meet individual children's emotional needs. Children have close, trusting, and respectful relationships with their teachers and peers. Values of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga strongly underpin the kindergarten culture and promotes a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for each child and their whānau.</p><p>Tuakana-teina relationships among children is providing them with leadership responsibility, and encouraging them to share their knowledge with one another. Children's social development is well supported by teachers. They provide children with social coaching, which helps them develop positive communication skills and to be socially competent. Children consistently hear and receive positive feedback from teachers who encourage them to share their ideas, develop and learn dispositions that they can transfer into other learning contexts.</p><p>Children's learning is further enriched by adults who come in once a week to facilitate kapa haka. Te reo and tikanga Māori is naturally integrated throughout the daily programme, modelled, and practised by teachers. The culture, language and identity of Māori children is valued, and children are developing a sound understanding, and knowledge of te reo Māori. Teachers have identified an area for future direction, which is to further develop their knowledge and understanding about culturally responsive assessment. Teachers are in the early stages of undertaking an action research project that involves inquiry into ways that support Māori children's cultural, language and identity.</p><p>Trips to the local and wider community provide more exciting and enjoyable experiences for children and parents to participate in and support their child's learning journey. Teachers have developed a good relationship with the local school and they join children in visits to events and performances. Older children's transition to school is supported by assessment summary sheets that highlight the learning children take with them from their kindergarten experiences. Teachers encourage families to share these with the new entrant teacher to support their learning pathway to school.</p><p>Child assessment portfolios show a rich picture of children's growth and learning over time. Mutually respectful relationships and open communication among teachers and parents benefit children's learning. Parents often stay and engage in their child's learning and play. Some families' access on-line portfolios and this provides additional opportunities for them to contribute to their child's learning.</p><p>Leadership at the kindergarten is highly effective and promotes a climate that puts children and their families first. Children are celebrated for what they bring to their learning. Teachers are reflective and inquire into their practice, with a focus on ongoing improvements to the curriculum and their practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Huntly completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Huntly will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>10 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
