</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kimberley Childcare Centre Greenlane is located in Greenlane, Auckland. It is one of two Christian-based services managed by the Kimberley Trust. The centre provides all-day care and education for up to 40 children, including up to 15 under two years old. Nutritional daily meals are provided for children.</p><p>A regional manager has responsibility for the overview of the two Kimberley Trust centres. Leadership restructuring has included newly defined roles for the centre manager and head teacher. Existing staff have been appointed to these roles.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes the development of children as creative, capable and competent learners. It aspires to encourage children‚Äôs curiosity, exploration and problem solving skills through inquiry approaches. The centre has a strong commitment to respecting and working alongside parents/whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre's 2013 ERO report identified many areas of improved practice relating to centre management and programme planning since the previous review in 2009. These improvements have been sustained. The 2013 ERO report also recommended a continuing focus on improving the programme provided for children and on increasing staff and whƒÅnau involvement in self review and strategic planning. Work in these areas continues.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed at the beginning of the day. Children are settled and well cared for. Teachers have positive relationships with children and their families/whƒÅnau. Children have good opportunities to play together and develop their social skills.</p><p>Children are friendly, confident and enjoy being in the centre. They engage in long periods of uninterrupted play. Children have easy access to a wide range of resources and are able to make flexible use of the environment.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from caring teachers who promote a calm and peaceful environment. Education and care routines are appropriately individualised, and children are well supported in their early language development.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children and support their play. Teachers identify children‚Äôs interests and plan activities to extend and support these interests. They now need to focus on what children‚Äôs interests mean for their learning and plan in ways that encourage increased levels of complex play and problem solving, particularly for older children.</p><p>Teachers make links to the children‚Äôs home experiences and provide an inclusive programme where all children develop a sense of belonging. The diverse cultural background of children and staff are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers could now build further on this cultural diversity to broaden and further enrich the programme.</p><p>Staff promote bicultural awareness through te reo MƒÅori, group activities and festive celebrations. Teachers are developing a good understanding of mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori and provide opportunities for children to speak te reo MƒÅori.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to plan activities and resources that reflect children‚Äôs interests and to document their time at the centre in portfolios and learning records. Parents value these records and enjoy accessing the recently introduced electronic portfolio. This is increasing their contribution to planning for their children's learning.</p><p>The regional manager has identified the need to develop and distribute leadership in the centre. She is committed to ongoing improvement to teaching practices and outcomes for children through the provision of regular professional learning opportunities for staff.</p><p>Governance of the centre is effective. Strategic and annual plans guide centre operations. Well established systems, policies and practices are in place to help protect the health and safety of children and adults in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that next key steps for the centre include further:</p><ul>
<li>building the centre's leadership capability and capacity</li>
<li>using current research and professional development to deepen teachers‚Äô evaluation of their practice and to promote ongoing improvements to teaching and learning</li>
<li>strengthening self-review processes through more in-depth reflection on the outcomes of reviews to guide the centre's development</li>
<li>developing teacher appraisal processes to align with Education Council requirements.<b>¬†</b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kimberley Childcare Greenlane completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kimberley Childcare Greenlane will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 April 2016¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
