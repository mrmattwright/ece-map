</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Dreamers opened in 2015. The centre was previously known as Ragamuffins. It provides full-day early childhood education and care for children over two years of age. The centre serves a diverse and multicultural community in Onehunga. This is the first ERO review of the centre under new management.</p><p>Since the centre changed ownership there have been major improvements inside the centre and in the outside environment. There have also been changes to teaching staff. A new head teacher and an assistant manager have been appointed. The staff includes five teachers, three of whom are qualified teachers. A cook prepares meals on site.</p><p>The new owners have a strong commitment to providing a high standard of education and care. They have been proactive in addressing the areas of concern from the Ragamuffins 2014 ERO report, and have focused on improving health and safety. Staff have attended professional development to strengthen their skills in supporting children's social competence and in self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are eager to learn and engage in play. They have fun, and have a strong sense of belonging. Children have good opportunities to make choices about their learning. The outside environment is well used by children to develop their physical skills and engage in sustained play. Children are able to express their creativity and imagination through art, music and dance. Science, literacy and mathematics concepts are also encouraged in the programme.</p><p>Respectful and caring relationships underpin the centre’s welcoming and relaxed tone. Centre leaders and staff look for ways to involve parents and make connections with the local community. Parents/whānau receive good information about their children's learning and are encouraged to join in, share ideas and provide feedback about centre programmes and events.</p><p>Teachers are affirming and supportive of children’s ideas and play. They know children well and encourage them to converse and play cooperatively. There is good support for children to maintain their first languages with some teachers using, and encouraging children to use, their home language. Children are also building their competence in the English language. Teachers provide children with good opportunities to make choices in the programme.</p><p>The play-based philosophy of the centre and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, underpin the programme for children. Teachers' interactions with children are kind and responsive. The environment is well resourced, clean and carefully maintained. Appropriate consideration is given to the preferences of toddlers. Teachers could provide greater challenge and complexity by making better use of available equipment. Centre leaders are aware that they should develop bicultural practices and strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Centre leaders have a strong commitment to developing a culture of teacher reflection and collaborative practices. Centre operations are guided by a clear vision, and sound management and administration practices. Leaders are aware that self review could be strengthened to be more evaluative and collaborative. A more evidence based appraisal process aligned to <em>Practicing Teacher Criteria</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> would support teachers to reflect and further enhance their own professional practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve outcomes for children, centre leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen centre operations so that strategic planning is more focused on educational outcomes and clearly linked to annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adapt and personalise existing policies so that they specifically match the centre's context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore ways to strengthen internal evaluation to increase its focus on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support teachers to respond to children’s individual emerging interests and ideas in planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide more opportunities for centre leaders, teachers and children to develop knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Centre leaders should access external professional development to strengthen teachers' collective understanding of child focused assessment and planning and improve the quality of teaching.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Dreamers Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice centre leaders should ensure that policies and procedures are aligned with the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Dreamers Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 April 2017  </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
