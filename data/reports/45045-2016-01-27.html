</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids Welcome Bay receives comprehensive governance and management support from BestStart Educare Centres (formerly Kidicorp), a charitable trust. BestStart education and care centres have a shared vision, purpose and values, designed to provide positive outcomes for children. This centre‚Äôs philosophy is based on building strong and reciprocal relationships, fostering respect and trust amongst family and whƒÅnau. The individuality of babies, toddlers and young children is recognised and valued in a supportive nurturing environment for education and care.</p><p>Topkids Welcome Bay is a purpose-built centre catering for children from 3 months to five years. There are two age-based rooms: Koru for babies and toddlers and Kahikitia for children over two years. A third room, Kauri is under review from management, but continues to provide a programme for four year olds each morning, using the Be School Ready principles. There is a designated head teacher for the babies and toddlers, and the centre manager leads the programme for the older children. Teachers know the children well and are familiar with their routines.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 50 children, including 20 up to the age of two years. The current roll is 66, with children of MƒÅori descent being the predominant ethnicity. The centre provides all-day and sessional care and education for babies, toddlers and young children from 7.30am to 5.30pm.</p><p>The centre manager is longstanding in the role and she is responsible for the overall day-to-day management and leadership of the centre. The majority of the teachers are fully qualified. Support staff, including the office administrator and the cook contribute to children‚Äôs wellbeing and the smooth running of the centre. Children receive nutritious morning teas and lunches.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review there has been a significant upgrade of the centre‚Äôs outdoor environments for learning. The professional services manager is continuing to work with the centre manager to address the areas identified for development in the 2012 ERO report. These were to strengthen the programme and teaching practices to empower children as learners. Teachers are receiving ongoing professional development, led by the professional services manager in collaboration with the centre manager.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs recent reporting history with ERO has been positive.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>BestStart Educare Centres has well developed systems to support centre operations, and to promote development. Business and professional services managers provide strong guidance and support to the centre manager. The centre‚Äôs strategic plan is reflective of the Trust‚Äôs focus on developing environments and leadership capability in ways that are most likely to contribute to positive outcomes for children. The Trust places high priority on the professional learning and development of its staff.</p><p>The professional services manager (PSM) is providing well informed professional leadership for the centre. She liaises closely with the centre manager, regularly observes the programme and provides evaluative reports for each teaching team. The PSM recognises that making these reports more explicit would be beneficial for the centre manager and teachers. This should provide them with clear direction, enable them to work collaboratively to review and refine the programme, and build teaching practices that are focussed on children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Professional learning and development is ongoing, accessible and relevant for teachers. It is closely aligned with the centre‚Äôs developing appraisal process. Teaching staff develop specific and measurable goals. There is an expectation that they will inquire into the effectiveness of their practice, document evidence of their progress, and there are ongoing opportunities for teachers to meet with their appraiser and share examples of good teaching practice. When fully implemented the centre' appraisal process is likely to bring about high levels of professional growth for leaders, teachers and support staff.</p><p>Teachers are committed to the development of trusting and reciprocal relationships. These are well developed and highly evident in the life of the centre. Parent voice is highly valued. Leaders and teachers are increasingly seeking different ways to connect with family/whƒÅnau to engage them in their children‚Äôs early education and care. The use of digital technology to involve and inform parents is a recent development. Leaders acknowledge the need for further parent in its use. Teachers find daily opportunities to talk with parents and share important information about their children‚Äôs care and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They are vigilant and responsive to children‚Äôs care needs and respond to the cues and non-verbal language of babies and toddlers. Practice is respectful of children‚Äôs individual differences and the centre manager is modelling an inclusive approach to children with special needs.</p><p>The centre manager, with support from the PSM, is working collaboratively with teaching staff to develop a more learner-centred curriculum. Features of the current curriculum are:</p><ul>
<li>the priority placed on developing children‚Äôs social competencies</li>
<li>the focus on developing children‚Äôs dispositions, in keeping with <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>the consistent recognition and valuing of the language, culture and identity of MƒÅori children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers now need to work on recognising the learning that is occurring, and develop responses that are likely to lead to meaningful and sustained play.</p><p>The newly developed outdoor environment is designed to support a more learner-centred curriculum/programme, and has engendered a new sense of pride in the centre‚Äôs surroundings.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leading the change: The centre manager, professional services and business managers recognise the need to work together and articulate a shared willingness and vision for the way forward as follows:</p><p>The centre manager will engage in relevant professional learning and development, and work with teachers to develop their understanding of current best practice for learning and teaching.</p><p>The focus areas for development will be closely aligned with teachers‚Äô appraisal goals and inquiries.</p><p>The centre manager will lead an inclusive process of curriculum review that affirms what is working well, takes account of parent aspirations, and leads to the development of a programme that is responsive to the emerging interests, needs and abilities of all children.</p><p>This change process should build teacher capability to provide more positive learning outcomes for as capable and confident learners.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Welcome Bay Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Welcome Bay Rd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>27 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
