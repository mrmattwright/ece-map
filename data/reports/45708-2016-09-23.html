</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre is licensed to provide education and care for up to 80 children, including 20 under two years of age. The purpose built centre opened in 2011. The facility has three separate play spaces for infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers.</p><p>The centre is privately owned and managed. A number of changes in staffing has impacted on the centre's ability to sustain improvement initiatives. Reorganisation of the leadership structure has improved consistency and stability for children and staff. This year the owner has taken on the role of centre director in the centre and an experienced head teacher is mentoring teachers. Together with a newly appointed Education and Practice Manager and a Centre Administrator the management lead nine qualified teachers and four unqualified staff. An experienced head teacher is also mentoring teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy has recently been reviewed. This review is ongoing as new centre staff are employed and inducted, and as all teachers develop shared understandings of what the philosophy looks like in practice.</p><p>The 2013 ERO evaluation found that review and change had been an important feature of centre practice. Teachers and children were benefitting from professional development in planning and assessment. Continued progress in these early developments were the priorities for improvement. This review finds that the owner and centre management have begun to implement some useful strategies to strengthen the sustainability of the centre and to improve progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre are confident and articulate. They enjoy opportunities to make friends and to develop their social competencies. Learning environments are well resourced, attractive and welcoming to all children. Literacy, maths and the natural world are included in the programme and children are encouraged to be creative. Teachers provide environments and resources that encourage meaningful and enjoyable exploration. The youngest children experience a calm and settled environment where the pace of the day is unhurried.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and children are warm and supportive. Adults provide caring and nurturing interactions. Teachers are respectful and responsive to children. Parents are warmly greeted and this supports children's sense of belonging.</p><p>There are some good models of assessment and planning to improve consistency of practice throughout the centre. In the best examples, assessments provide good records of children's individual learning and builds the child's identity as a successful learner. Teachers value and seek the contributions of parents to programmes. Children's home languages and cultures are well supported.</p><p>The management team leads an effective process of internal evaluation to drive improvement. There is a commitment to building teacher's understanding of teaching as inquiry that contributes to positive outcomes for all children. Management should continue to develop team relationships and shared understanding by implementing a cohesive plan to build teachers' emergent leadership.</p><p>Management have planned strategically for teachers to improve their bicultural practices. Teachers use some basic te reo, karakia and waiata in the programme. Consideration could be given to professional development to deepen teachers' knowledge of te ao Maori, and supporting an authentic local curriculum.</p><p>A staff appraisal process has recently been established. Centre management are aware of the need to continue to strengthen the process to align with the requirements of the Education Council. The centre continues to endeavour to recruit and retain qualified teaching staff. Centre policies and procedures have recently undergone review and development. The 2013 ERO review identified the need to implement an appraisal and personnel policy and procedures. Aspects of these procedures have recently been developed and management are continuing to fully address these matters.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and centre leaders agree that their priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>for teachers to access professional development to improve their implementation of a bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build collaborative ways of working towards the strategic goals and the enactment of the centre vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to recruit and develop competent teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to ensure all policies and procedures required to meet <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em> and <em>Early Childhood Education Curriculum Framework</em>, are established.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to human resource management. To meet requirements the service‚Äôs managers must develop and implement a policy which outlines suitable human resource management practices including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>selection and appointment procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>job/role descriptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>induction procedures into the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system of appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a definition of serious misconduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discipline/dismissal procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres, 2008; Governance, management and administration; professional practices: GMA7.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Camrose Kids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
