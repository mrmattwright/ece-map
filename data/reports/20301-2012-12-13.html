<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Flanshaw Early Childhood Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre operates under an effective external management organisation and a governance committee. This committee includes the principal of Flanshaw Road School and parents from the centre community.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Flanshaw Early Childhood Centre is one of two community not-for-profit centres operating in the grounds of Flanshaw Road School. The centre caters for children between three and five years of age. Children are from the local area and generally go on to the adjacent primary school. Teachers successfully transition children from the centre to the school.</p><p>A strong teaching team and effective leadership impact positively on the quality of the programme for children. The shared understanding teachers have of their professional practice promotes meaningful and well considered outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy clearly outlines a commitment to promoting children&rsquo;s positive self image with an emphasis on respectful relationships. The philosophy prompts teachers to provide learning opportunities that are inviting and challenging within a visually pleasing environment. The Review Findings</p><p>Teachers and children enjoy respectful and friendly relationships and interactions. Children settle easily, playing together in friendly, cooperative and inclusive ways. They talk freely together and friendships are evident. Teachers have developed successful partnerships and communication with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Centre managers support teachers to build their professional knowledge and expertise through shared professional development. Teachers also adapt current theories of early childhood education to suit children at this centre. Teachers plan the programme together using assessment and planning practices that reflect current professional development.</p><p>Teachers have worked together to enhance bicultural practices. Active participation by centre and school wh&#257;nau has helped to strengthen the recognition and implementation of tikanga M&#257;ori. Te reo M&#257;ori is used well by some teachers in the context of their work with children.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s settled and sustained play is supported by high quality resources and the thoughtful arrangement of play areas. Children choose from a wide range of appropriate activities and experiences that teachers provide for them, including information and communication technologies (ICT). Changes to the environment enable the centre to provide an inclusive programme for all children.</p><p>Well established review processes promote consistency and reflect the focus on the development of the centre and teaching practices. Teachers should continue to make self-review processes meaningful as a way of monitoring and improving learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre managers and ERO agree on the next steps for centre development. Managers recognise the advantages of continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>develop processes for programme planning and assessment to more clearly show teachers&rsquo; understanding of children and their dispositions as learners</li>
<li>strengthen bicultural provision and practices in collaboration with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>reflect further on ways of strengthening the programme for Pacific children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also agrees there is value in planning to:</p><ul>
<li>implement self-review processes that include critical reflection by teachers about how children learn, and systems of documenting that record outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Flanshaw Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>13 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
