</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Grow and Learn Early Learning Centre is a privately owned service situated in Elsdon, Porirua. The centre offers all day sessions for up to 40 children, including 10 aged up to two years. The¬†licenseeowner manages the centre and leads a team of 5 teaching staff. This is the service‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on 'kotahitanga; making all welcome to share their experiences, skills and knowledge, where teachers strive to create a passion for learning and offer opportunities for children to be independent, explore and know it is their place'.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be independent learners in a calm, respectful and unhurried environment. Routines are responsive to the mixed age group and support children to develop independence and self-help skills. Children engage well in sustained play together. They are curious and enjoy the many opportunities to make choices and contribute to the programme.</p><p>Teachers foster children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. They provide support appropriate to children's ages and stages of development. Tuakana teina practice is evident with older children supporting younger children.</p><p>Respectful, responsive and nurturing care giving contributes to infants and toddlers developing a positive sense of themselves. The specific needs of infants and toddlers are recognised and well catered for. They have unrestricted access to an environment which encourages exploration.</p><p>Relationships with families and whƒÅnau are based on mutual respect and trust. Regular conversations between teachers and parents help connect children‚Äôs home and centre experiences and learning. Teachers continue to seek ways to gain feedback from whƒÅnau about their children's learning.</p><p>Teachers know children well and respond to their interests. They are guided by children's play and use conversations to support investigation and extension of ideas. Children's profile books are attractive records of their time at the centre. Teachers capture and celebrate learning and achievements through well-documented learning stories. Family and whƒÅnau experiences are included.</p><p>The principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> successfully influence the service's curriculum and are evident in practice. Children actively lead their own learning and participate in decision making. There is a strong emphasis on developing and extending children's literacy and numeracy skills. Ongoing team discussions, based on observations, effectively influence programme planning. Strengthening assessment practices to clearly show the way teachers respond to children's learning and to show progression of learning over time is a next step.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and beyond are sensitively managed and responsive to the needs of each child, their family and whƒÅnau. Teachers have begun to build a relationship with the local school. This helps to make the process of starting school a positive experience for children and their families. Teachers recognise it is timely to consider developing stronger relationships with local schools to further support children's transitions from the centre.</p><p>Inclusive practices support children‚Äôs cultures and identities, and cater for those with additional learning needs. The centre's relationships with external agencies contribute to timely interventions to help children's participation and enjoyment in their learning.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are successfully reflected in the environment and teaching practice through manaakitanga, kotahitanga and aroha. Teachers are developing programmes that affirm MƒÅori children's language, culture and identity and have identified the need to make links with the local iwi to strengthen educational success for MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre manager values the knowledge and skills teachers bring to teaching and learning. They work collaboratively as a team to improve learning outcomes for children, their families and whƒÅnau. Centre operations are guided by management with a focus on some shared leadership opportunities. The centre manager acknowledges the need to further delegate roles and responsibilities to build teacher capability and support professional growth for teachers.</p><p>Supporting professional practice is well considered and aligns to the service's strategic and annual priorities for development and teacher appraisal goals. It is timely to strengthen the consistency of the implementation and documentation of the appraisal process. The centre manager needs to ensure the process is followed to support teacher growth and to meet legislative requirements. She is yet to be appraised.</p><p>There is a useful framework to guide centre self-review. Teachers work through a systematic process of review to inquire into the effectiveness of programmes. A recent review on literacy and numeracy has contributed to improved outcomes for children and whƒÅnau. Teachers are well positioned to strengthen this process by inquiring more deeply into and evaluating their practices for ongoing improvement to all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grow and Learn Early Learning Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h4>Non compliance</h4><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve personnel practices in relation to the appraisal of all teaching staff.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Grow and Learn Early Learning Centre Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
