</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gladstone Park Early Childhood Centre caters for up to 46 children from three months to five years of age. Younger children, up to the age to two, are grouped together and have valuable opportunities to play alongside their siblings and older peers for parts of the day. The service offers full day and sessional education and care with an emphasis on working respectfully with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>This centre is one of two centres operated and managed by the Parnell Community Trust. The Trust continues to provide governance, administration and professional support services. The centre is located at the edge of a public park and has a spacious environment for children to explore.</p><p>In January 2014 the ERO report highlighted ongoing concerns with the leadership and management of the centre including self-review practices and the quality of the programme provided. Teachers were also required to increase their responsiveness to children to improve the quality of education and care.</p><p>Since then, a new centre manager and several new staff have joined the teaching team. External professional development and support provided by the Ministry of Education has supported leaders to address the areas for improvement. The new Trust CEO has also provided leadership support to assist the new centre leader to promote more positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has made very good progress in improving the quality of education and care for children. Children benefit from positive interactions with teachers that support their confidence and feeling of belonging at the centre. They settle quickly. Younger children benefit from the sense of security and comfort provided by caring, responsive teachers.</p><p>Teachers now have a positive and optimistic teaching approach. They are working as a team to better support children's learning by encouraging and affirming children. The more positive working environment is helping to promote a culture that is child centred and family friendly. Teachers are collaborating with children to develop a programme that is engaging for the children. Children are better supported to make choices and decisions about their learning.</p><p>Leaders are continuing to extend opportunities and resources for children to experience a broader and more meaningful curriculum that challenges their thinking. Continuing to review the structure of the programme to offer children further opportunities to sustain or revisit their play is an area for further consideration. Finding ways to provide more complexity and challenge in the under-twos' environment is also an agreed priority.</p><p>Planning makes more effective use of children's interests to inform the programme. Children's individual portfolios are increasingly providing a record of their learning throughout the programme. Continuing to improve the consistency and quality documentation of individual children's learning and seeking more parent input should further strengthen planning and assessment practices.</p><p>WhƒÅnau have more opportunities to participate and offer their input through improved consultation and communication. Teachers are responding to parent aspirations for older children by providing time together to work collaboratively and explore their ideas in relevant ways.</p><p>The centre is well led. The centre manager, team leaders and teachers work effectively as a team. Centre leaders and Trust senior managers acknowledge the importance of continuing to build leadership capability across the centre. Self review is now well established and focussed on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The Parnell Community Trust provides effective governance and management oversight to centre leaders. The Trust strategic plan provides long-term goals for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that, to continue to improve outcomes for children, it would be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>find ways to distribute teacher leadership roles in order to enhance children's literacy, mathematical and science exploration within meaningful play contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the ways teachers respond to children' home language, culture and diverse background, providing further opportunities to develop children's bilingual language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use strategic planning to consolidate centre improvements and use measurable indicators to evaluate centre progress toward meeting goals that enhance children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen performance management processes and the quality of teachers' evidence to meet Education Council requirements relating to teachers' practising certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gladstone Park Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that items that could fall and injure in the case of an earthquake are secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>find ways to maintain the adequate spacing of cots and beds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the shade over the outdoor play area, particularly for children under two.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gladstone Park Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
