</table><p>Pelorus Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children up to the age of five attend this preschool from a wide geographical area. The service's location next to a primary school enables sharing of facilities that benefits children. The preschool's outdoor environment was substantially improved in 2015 to provide better facilities for children.</p><p>An elected parent board provides governance of the centre. Staffing at the centre has mostly remained stable. The service is licensed for 30 children, many of whom attend on a part-time basis, especially in the under-two area.</p><p>A significant strength of the preschool is its positive relationships and support from the community. Many resources that are valuable for children's learning have been made and donated by community members. Other examples of community support include annual fundraising that is used to improve resources for children.</p><p>The preschool is part of a local education cluster that is focused on positive outcomes for children. Although improvements are evident in some areas identified in the 2012 ERO report, further development is needed in other areas such as self review and governance.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from the preschool's culture of care for the wellbeing of children. Preschool leaders and teachers know children and their families well and have systems in place to keep them well informed.</p><p>The preschool provides a wide range of learning experiences for children. They have many opportunities to follow their interests and engage in creative and collaborative play for extended periods of time. Programmes include and reflect the local environment. This provides considerable potential for children’s exploration, learning and enjoyment.</p><p>Teachers in the under two area provide good care and a useful range of indoor and outdoor opportunities for early learning development. Children's sense of belonging and confidence to explore the environment remain a key focus of the care and support that teachers provide.</p><p>Centre programmes and activities provide some opportunities for children to learn about te reo and tikanga Māori. Preschool leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that an important priority now is to improve practices in this area.</p><p>Children with particular social or learning needs receive very good support and care at the centre. Centre leaders readily access external support where necessary and teachers work collaboratively to meet children's diverse needs.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about their children and centre activities. They are welcomed at the centre and have ongoing opportunities to give feedback about their children's learning.</p><p>The centre's board uses well-documented processes and systems that promote sustainable governance practices. Trustees communicate well with staff and maintain positive relationships with the community. The new appraisal system introduced in 2016 reflects a number of improvements. Centre leaders should ensure that they include relevant reporting information to the board about the impact of the new system on teaching practices and outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have made progress since the 2012 ERO review in their understanding and use of self review. They agree with ERO that further improvements could include strengthening the evaluative nature of spontaneous and planned self review. Identifying the impact of teaching strategies on children's learning would provide information about approaches that are having the greatest impact on children's wellbeing and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree with ERO that the key priorities for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that regular board training includes effective ways of building governance capacity and self-review practices</li>
<li>make sure that there are clear board expectations for reporting requirements from centre leaders, such as risk assurance management</li>
<li>continue to build capability and expertise in self review across all leaders and teachers</li>
<li>improve assessment practices to strengthen the way children's learning and next steps are identified, including the specific strategies teachers will use to support and extend learning</li>
<li>further develop te ao Māori in centre programmes, practices and environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the onsite stage of the review, ERO found that some aspects of the centre's risk management procedures and practices needed to be improved.</p><p>The board and centre leaders must fully comply with all aspects of health and safety practices related to excursions out of the centre [Criterion HS17].</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pelorus Community Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>6 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
