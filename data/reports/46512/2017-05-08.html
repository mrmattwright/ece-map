</table><p>Shining Star Educare is a newly established service. Leaders are still developing systems to operate the centre effectively, particularly in relation to management, documentation and the quality of learning experiences for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Shining Star Educare is a privately owned, Pacific service in a renovated villa in Otahuhu. The centre opened in 2014 and is still in the early stages of development. The owner has employed an external adviser to help establish administration and management systems</p><p>The centre provides full-day education and care for up to 33 children, including up to 10 under two years old. Age groups are often mixed but the younger children also have a designated indoor space for withdrawal when appropriate. Most children on the roll and all staff have Tongan heritage. The owner has expressed a vision to offer an inclusive service that brings together and values Māori and Pacific cultures and traditions.</p><p>Four of the staff are qualified teachers although three, including the owner, still have provisional teaching certificates. They have participated in some professional development workshops. There are plans to provide support for staff to further develop programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states that the owner and staff aspire to providing a safe, nurturing and stimulating environment that enables children to become competent and capable learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner and staff have very positive relationships with families, some of whom travel distances to use the centre. Families appreciate the sense of belonging they have in a centre that supports their Christian values as well as their cultural heritage and languages.</p><p>Children have a sense of belonging in the centre. They connect with friends, have positive relationships with teachers and respond well when adults support their play. Children enjoy the outdoor environment where they often engage in group play and enthusiastically participate in music and movement as well as other physical activities. They would benefit from more opportunities for complex play that encourages them to think and explore their own ideas.</p><p>Teachers consistently work alongside children and encourage their involvement in activities. Adults' interactions with children are positive, often integrating te reo Māori or Tongan language in their conversations. They include the small number of infants and toddlers in group activities while also enabling them to play with infant resources. Teachers could now evaluate the quality and impact of the formal literacy and numeracy tasks that they lead at mat times. Children would gain much better understanding of these concepts in meaningful play contexts.</p><p>Teachers have developed a planning format that helps them to identify resources and activities that could support children's current interests. There is limited focus on children's individual strengths and interests. As a result, learning stories capture children's involvement in programme activities rather than assessing their individual progress and dispositions to become capable, independent learners. As part of their planned professional development teachers could also include a focus on strategies to support children's oral language development.</p><p>The environment is not yet fully developed. The owner is in the process of extending the licence to include an additional building and a greatly extended outdoor playground. In the interim the outdoor space is confined, has no sandpit and a limited range of play options for children.</p><p>The owner has successfully opened up the interior of the centre to provide more spacious rooms. However, these spaces are not well organised to enable children to independently access a sufficient variety of good quality equipment and resources. Teachers should consider how their expectations for children's learning will be supported by the environment and their teaching strategies.</p><p>A challenge for the teaching team is to develop a shared understanding about how to achieve the goals identified in their philosophy, and how they will know when they are successful. The owner and external adviser have begun documenting strategic planning, staff appraisals and policy development. Processes for self review are largely informal.</p><p>The owner acknowledges that documentation must be improved to enhance the management, administration and leadership of the centre. Steps the owner and staff team could take to improve centre operations include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a process for implementing the new strategic plan, including an alignment with teachers' appraisal goals and professional development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording all staff meeting minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre's philosophy to ensure it reflects a shared vision for the centre and guides practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the team could consider ways to further share leadership responsibilities. This would help the owner in her roles as the centre leader, manager, and a rostered trainee teacher. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and their adviser agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhancing the quality of teaching strategies and learning experiences for children to extend their thinking, foster their oral language and develop complexity in their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the provision and organisation of the environment to ensure children always have good access to adequate resources, and to all traditional early childhood play areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing teachers with professional development that will support them to improve planning assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing rigorous, documented processes for regular, spontaneous and strategic self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that practices, procedures, resourcing and documentation meet expected standards before extending the centre's licence.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Shining Star Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the owner should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review health and safety practices, equipment and records to ensure appropriate standards are maintained and legal requirements are met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promptly review policies in response to law changes and ensure they are signed and dated. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management of the centre. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular teacher appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintaining current police vetting for all non-certificated staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and updating policies to incorporate the requirements of <em>The Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, GMA7A.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Shining Star Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
