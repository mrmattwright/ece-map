</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Beehive Childcare Centre is a small rural centre that provides full day education and care for up to 30 children, including 5 less than two years of age. The centre is located in the grounds of the Lifeways Ministry Trust, in Snells Beach and was previously known as LIFE Childcare Centre-North. At the time of the 2010 ERO review it operated as Kidzway Childcare and Learning Centre.</p><p>In mid-2013 the centre changed ownership and was relicensed as The Beehive Childcare Centre. The centre operates independently of the Lifeways Ministry Trust. The new managers maintain close connections with the Trust and have sustained the Christian focus as an integral part of their philosophy and centre operations.</p><p>Since the 2010 review centre managers have improved the environment, and management planning. The under two area is now on the same level as the older children allowing easier access to the outside area. Professional development has supported teachers to improve positive guidance and teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre managers have a strong commitment to provide a good quality service and develop a culture of teacher reflection and ongoing improvement. A clear strategic plan and vision guides centre operations. Sound systems for self review and accountability have been established. The centre's philosophy statement is well documented and understood by the centre‚Äôs community. Teachers‚Äô professional capabilities and leadership are fostered through ongoing professional development.</p><p>Children are confident, play cooperatively and communicate well. They have a strong sense of belonging and a growing respect for themselves and others. Children have good opportunities to make choices about their play. Teachers support children to develop their physical skills and early science, literacy and mathematics concepts in the well resourced environment. Children are capable, caring and sociable learners.</p><p>Responsive and caring relationships underpin the centre‚Äôs welcoming tone. Centre managers and staff value parental and community involvement. Parents/whƒÅnau receive good information about their children's learning and are encouraged to take an active part in the centre programme and events.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive individualised, nurturing care in an attractive appropriately resourced area. Toddlers have good access to the outdoors, time with older children and a wide variety of activities. There is a relaxed atmosphere and teachers are attentive and responsive to infants‚Äô needs and preferences.</p><p>Children actively engage in play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. Teachers are affirming of children‚Äôs ideas and supportive of children‚Äôs play. However, teachers could extend child-initiated play and foster more challenging learning experiences. Teachers could also further develop conversations with children to promote their independent thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p><p>The Christian philosophy of the centre is evident and interwoven in the programme for children. Warm relationships, respectful interactions, and increasingly, <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, underpin the programme. Centre leaders are keen to develop bicultural practices and more child-led assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Centre managers are aware that self-review could be strengthened to be more evaluative, collaborative and child focused. External professional development would assist them to develop robust self review to guide improvements to teaching practices and the educational programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>deepening teachers' understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> and promoting child initiated learning</li>
<li>reviewing how biculturalism is enacted in ways that promote MƒÅori language, culture and identity</li>
<li>developing assessment and planning processes that show how children‚Äôs individual interests are noticed, responded to and extended over time</li>
<li>reviewing how well the ‚ÄòGet Ready for School‚Äô programme aligns with the centre philosophy, and <em>Te WhƒÅriki.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Beehive Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice centre managers should implement formal, clearly documented appraisal processes to assist teachers to enhance their teaching practices.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Beehive Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
