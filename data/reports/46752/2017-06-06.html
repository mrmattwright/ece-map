</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Inspiring Minds Montessori Pre-School is a privately owned service close to the central business district of Palmerston North. The centre has operated for two years. It is licensed to provide education and care for up to 28 children aged over two years. Attending children come from local suburbs and surrounding rural districts.</p><p>The centre owner has overall responsibility for governance and management. Her focus since opening the centre, has been to develop relationships with teachers, whƒÅnau, children and local schools. She is supported by three qualified and two unqualified teachers. Most teachers have a Montessori qualification.</p><p>The philosophy, due to be reviewed later this year, reflects preschool practices that are based on Montessori philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>This is the first report for Inspiring Minds Montessori Pre-School.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently participate in a programme that promotes curiosity. They are regularly consulted on the planned programme. The learning environment is well resourced with a range of appropriate learning resources, including specialist Montessori learning materials. These support children to choose, experience challenge and revisit prior learning.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and science concepts are part of children's daily learning. Friendships are encouraged and independent focused play is a regular occurrence. The outdoor environment is well developed to promote children's physical skills and understanding of the natural world.</p><p>A focused group time provides opportunities for children to become familiar with languages of participating children through song and storytelling. Parents are encouraged to participate in a termly whƒÅnau session to work and play alongside their children.</p><p>Teachers are intentional in the way they recognise and respond to opportunities to engage with and extend children's learning. They use a range of strategies to support children in sustained play. Staff are respectful of children's decisions and rights to express their points of view.</p><p>Currently, children's portfolio documentation is inconsistent between teachers. To improve practice teachers' should ensure that all stories:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include clear assessment and evaluation that draws on planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respond to parent and whƒÅnau aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make visible the child's culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Review is regularly undertaken and leads to improvement. The process is collaborative and includes parent and whƒÅnau voice. Strengthening evaluation by inquiring into areas of practice and assessing the impact of any changes made is a next step.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is managed with care as they transition into the centre. Teachers support parents to settle their child according to needs. The leader is proactively developing relationships between the centre and local schools. Developing clear processes for children's transition to school has been identified by teachers as an area for development. The current self¬†review is informing this process. A next step is to develop and implement a robust procedure to support children and their families in this transition.</p><p>The manager has a strong commitment to the provision of quality outcomes for all children, and building and supporting the teaching team's professional practice. The strategic plan effectively guides centre activities. Progress towards this plan should now be regularly evaluated.</p><p>Teachers take full responsibility for the education and care of children with diverse needs, ensuring they participate fully in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. Teachers have attended professional development to further refine and enhance their practices to support all children's needs.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are clearly evident throughout the environment. Children's cultures, languages and identities are valued. Culturally significant events are celebrated. Teachers and leaders actively participate in professional development to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori. A next step is to embed this new learning.</p><p>All staff participate in an annual appraisal process. Regular observations of teacher practice occur. Teachers are highly reflective. Use of <em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em>, and consideration of the purpose of evidence in relation to the Practising Teacher Criteria is likely to add value to the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review/internal evaluation practices, to more clearly identify the impact of teaching on learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>processes to support children and their families transition to school.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Inspiring Minds Montessori Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Inspiring Minds Montessori Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>6 June 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
