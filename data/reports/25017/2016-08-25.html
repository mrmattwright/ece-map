</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Howick provides education and care for up to 50 children, including 15 children under two years of age. The centre is located in the Howick Recreation Leisure Centre. Many of the families who use the facilities also use this service. The centre provides casual, part-time and full-time education and care. Five of the eight staff are fully qualified teachers.</p><p>Since the centre’s 2014 ERO review, managers have addressed areas of concern and non-compliance identified by ERO. There have been staff and leadership changes and a new head teacher has been appointed. Targeted professional learning and development has resulted in significant improvements. The good quality practices that were noted in the 2014 ERO report remain evident. As a new team, teachers are developing consistent and cohesive practices to maintain ongoing improvement.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy has been reviewed in consultation with parents. Working with whānau to create a solid foundation that nurtures children’s interests and holistic development is an integral part of the philosophy, which is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and includes an organisational belief that ‘active bodies have active minds’.</p><p>Kauri Kids Howick is one of ten early childhood centres that are owned by and operate within policies and framework of the Auckland Council. The Auckland Council delegates management responsibility to the Childcare Services Manager. The centre’s head teacher works closely with a newly appointed curriculum manager, who visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four Kauri Kids reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre have fun, play cooperatively, and are confident in their environment. Most are aware of the centre routines. Infants and toddlers enjoy a sense of belonging and benefit from nurturing interactions in their separate space. There is respectful care for babies and they are free to explore in their spacious environment.</p><p>A newly appointed centre head teacher has led many of the recent improvements to curriculum, the environment and health and safety. She has implemented a change management approach that affirms teachers’ capability and encourages further development. An established self-review process is in place and supports staff to make ongoing improvements. Centre leaders are aware that self review is an area to be further developed.</p><p>With the support of the curriculum leader, teachers have established a system of planning to guide programme implementation. The planned programme is becoming more responsive to children’s interests, dispositions and strengths. All children now have learning portfolios with learning stories that show their individual interests. Teachers are now beginning to evaluate the outcomes of their planning. A teacher is responsible for the bicultural programme and all teachers are developing their confidence in te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers have successfully focused on team building and working collaboratively. They have an increased sense of ownership of their practice and goals. They should now consider how to increase the documentation of children’s ideas and how these ideas impact on planning and programme teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions are warm and affirming, and support children’s play. Their next challenge is to support children to extend the complexity of their play.</p><p>Teachers benefit from the head teacher’s strong leadership. The Auckland Council also provides leadership and professional development opportunities for teachers. There is a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures, administration and professional support.</p><p>Self review is established and becoming more focused on improving outcomes for children. There is a shared vision and clear direction guided by the strategic and annual plans. A rigorous appraisal system has been implemented that aligns to the strategic plan and teacher goals. Teachers’ appraisals identify appropriate professional learning needed to support their development.</p><p>The Auckland Council has good systems to guide centre management and governance and to maintain ongoing improvement and ensure accountability. There is also a robust system in place to monitor health and safety practices and ensure all centres meet legislative requirements. The Auckland Council has a strong commitment to implementing bicultural practices and responding to community needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the focus on learning and building a cohesive team culture</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen and embed the bicultural programme and promoting children’s language, culture and identity</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation using indicators of good practice.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Howick completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Kids Howick will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer<br>Northern</p><p>25 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
