</table><p>Kauri Kids Howick¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Howick is one of 11 Kauri Kids community-based childcare centres owned by the Auckland Council. It operates out of the Howick Recreation Leisure Centre and is licensed for full-day education and care for 50 children, including 15 children under two years of age. The centre caters for children from the multicultural community. A non-permanent head teacher, who is supporting the centre for a short time, leads the long-serving teaching team comprising of six qualified and two unqualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy of the organisation is based on setting an environment that empowers children to lead their own learning. Strong emphasis is placed on building partnerships with whƒÅnau based on trust, respect and the best interests of each child. <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti O Waitangi</span> and <em><span lang="mi">Te WhƒÅriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, are recognised as guiding documents.</p><p>There are two separate large indoor and outdoor spaces for children to play. Although the infants and toddlers are accommodated in separate areas, they regularly mix with older children at the start and end of the day.</p><p>The Kauri Kids Centres are managed centrally by Auckland Council. Kauri Kids, as part of Auckland Council, provide a governance and management framework, and support personnel to assist the centres. An ECE operations manager is responsible for the overall operation of the Kauri Kids services. The head teacher in each service reports to the centre manager of the facility where the service is based.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2016 report noted how children had fun, played co-operatively and interactions were affirming. These aspects of good practice continue. The report recommended that the centre strengthen internal evaluation using indicators of good practice. Although some aspects of effective internal evaluation have been sustained, this is an area that requires further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Auckland-wide Kauri Kids organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is highly evident in practice. Trusting, respectful and nurturing relationships between teachers, children and families are highly valued. Children have a strong sense of belonging. They settle quickly and engage with a wide range of open-ended materials that encourage imaginative play in a well-resourced environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from learning in a small group with a high ratio of adults. They are well cared for and happily play alongside one another. A wide range of resources encourage children's role play of daily life tasks and opportunities to develop oral language.</p><p>Older children enthusiastically collaborate and take many opportunities to enhance their investigative skills within the large indoor and outdoor areas. They lead their own learning, uninterrupted, which encourages children's sustained play and interests. Children's individual learning portfolios provide meaningful evidence of children‚Äôs play.</p><p>Teachers know children well, fostering their sense of wellbeing and supporting them to grow their social competence. Children‚Äôs preferences are respected. It would be useful for teachers in the over two years area to consider ways of engaging children in more meaningful conversations to encourage children‚Äôs oral language and thinking.</p><p>The new head teacher has developed positive relationships with the staff and is committed to ongoing professional learning and development (PLD).</p><p>The ECE operations manager effectively oversees the centres. She implements appropriate processes to increase head teacher communication and develops a shared understanding of the philosophy. Kauri Kids provides a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures and a robust appraisal process. Internal evaluation frameworks are now being established.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>For ongoing centre improvement and to enhance children's learning, the ECE curriculum manager and head teacher agree they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase teachers‚Äô understanding of their role in planning for children‚Äôs more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teacher capability in evaluation, to measure the impact of their practice on children‚Äôs learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps for the governing organisation</h3><p>It would be beneficial for Kauri Kids to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to offer leadership PLD and provide opportunities to enhance the leadership skills of head teachers and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen educators' use of planning, assessment and evaluation processes for ongoing children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to identify how well new initiatives have impacted on learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure children have opportunities to experience and enhance their language, culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Howick completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>6 April 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">NgƒÅ Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
