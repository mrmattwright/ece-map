</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Elizabeth Avenue Childcare Centre is a privately-owned service located in Upper Hutt. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 37 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. Of the 52 enrolled, eight children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments provides opportunities for exploration and collaborative play for infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers. There is a natural world emphasis with a wide range of resources to support learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights the importance of respectful interactions, children's interest leading the curriculum, and the provision of a safe and nurturing environment.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Staff are continuing their professional learning and development in bicultural practice and internal evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children are highly engaged and active in their learning. Nurturing and purposeful relationships are well established between children and teachers. Interactions are positive and respectful. Strong manaakitanga enhances and fosters a whƒÅnau-based centre where each member is respected and valued. These factors support positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children follow their interests and explore their ideas. Challenge to children's learning is offered and supported throughout play-based experiences. Teachers know children well and their whƒÅnau, their interests and their preferences for learning. A high level of respect for the child's home life is evident throughout adult-child conversations.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is highly evident in practice. The planned review of the philosophy should help to develop stronger links to how the centre focuses on and enhances positive outcomes for children. Developing expectations for teacher practice and reflection should further improve outcomes.</p><p>Children experience a well-considered and broad curriculum. The emerging interests of individuals and groups are used effectively by teachers to plan the programme for learning. This is used to help guide and support learning dispositions and provide opportunities for challenge and extension.</p><p>Children‚Äôs learning stories effectively capture their stages of development and learning journeys during their time at the centre. Parent and whƒÅnau aspirations are the basis for all narratives. Teachers are highly responsive to these. They recognise, celebrate and extend the child's learning in response to these aspirations.</p><p>Teachers value and promote te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Children confidently use te reo MƒÅori in everyday activities. It is timely to review how effectively they recognise, incorporate and celebrate the bicultural uniqueness of Aotearoa. This should then better inform appropriate teaching strategies to enhance outcomes for MƒÅori children as well.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach to responding to children with diverse needs. A supportive, team approach identifies how best to meet the needs, extend the learning opportunities and enhance the successful journey of the child at the centre and beyond. A focus on empowering the child, parents and whƒÅnau in responding to diversity is highly evident.</p><p>The visiting teacher focuses her reports on building teachers' capability and their understanding of an evaluative approach to improve outcomes for children. Continuing to explore these with the teaching team should help to ensure all teachers have a shared understanding and are applying this information. Incorporating inquiry and evaluation into the appraisal process should help to strengthen it and foster high quality reflection on the impact teachers' practice has on enhancing children's learning.</p><p>The centre is focused on further improving the quality of education and care through systematic self review. The findings are effectively informing change and are being used to build leadership capacity. There is clear alignment to the strategic direction of the centre. Continuing to improve the links between the strategic and annual plan with policies, appraisal, and professional development should help to enhance clear communication to guide practice in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree the next step for improvement is to use internal evaluation to:</p><ul>
<li>develop indicators of high quality teaching practice expectations in alignment with the centre philosophy</li>
<li>build MƒÅori success and strengthen biculturalism through a culturally responsive curriculum</li>
<li>review policies and procedures for clarity and alignment to practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elizabeth Avenue Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Elizabeth Avenue Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
