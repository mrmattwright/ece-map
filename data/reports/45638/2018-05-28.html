</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Samoana Early Education Development (SEED AA3) was established in 2011. It is one of two aoga amata owned by a family business that has served the Porirua community for 15 years. The SEEDS AA3 service is licensed for 44 children, including 14 children up to 2 years of age. Most of the 35 children on the roll are Samoan. There are smaller groups of children from other Pacific groups, and a few MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ children.</p><p>The aoga philosophy affirms the importance of children's cultural backgrounds and home language. It also notes the importance of children's play in a caring learning environment based on Christian values.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that Samoan language and culture and Christian values underpinned the aoga philosophy. This continues to be a strength. The 2015 ERO report also included actions to be taken to meet licensing requirements. Managers have responded well to these requirements. They have reviewed their assessment practices and implemented new internal evaluation processes. Recommendations to implement improved personnel management practices have also been met.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, capable learners with a strong sense of place and belonging. They play in a spacious environment that promotes cooperative and independent play. The Samoan culture and identity are valued. Children have rich opportunities to hear gagana Samoa in songs and prayer, and through their interactions with adults.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy a warm, caring environment. They confidently explore their own well-resourced space and often join the older children for song and music experiences. Teachers engage well with the young children, nurturing their language and learning through their interactions.</p><p>The team of qualified teachers fosters and values respectful relationships. Inclusive practices ensure that children with additional learning needs are well supported. Wall displays reflect children's participation in a variety of science, literacy and maths experiences. Teachers should now consider strategies to extend children's learning in the context of their play.</p><p>Teachers have made good progress in how they notice, recognise and respond to children's interests. They are collaborative and plan programmes that support children's strengths and learning. Children have access to portfolios to revisit their prior experiences and learning. Displays on walls celebrate the cultures of all the children. MƒÅori perspectives are integrated into children's play and learning experiences.</p><p>Targeted professional learning has impacted positively on building the aoga management and curriculum practices. Leaders are developing internal evaluation processes that are increasingly focused on improvement. Internal evaluation should now include reflection on improving the quality of programmes for children.</p><p>The aoga is managed by a well qualified governance team that oversees the two services. Leaders have a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and cultural values of the centre. It is timely to revisit the philosophy and include <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, into the curriculum statement. The aoga amata has robust systems, policies and practices which have strengthened the service. Leaders could now focus on developing a strategic plan that includes goals for improving the quality of teaching, leadership, resources and property.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Aoga managers and leaders agree that the next key steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to help teachers to challenge and extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the quality of resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher planning and evaluation to better document children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing teacher and leadership capability to implement quality assurance systems that lift the quality of the curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Samoana Early Education Development Services (SEEDS AA3) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Samoana Early Education Development Services (SEEDS AA3) will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
