</table><p>ERO recommends external support to strengthen governance, management systems and teaching practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Samoana Early Education Development Service (SEEDS AA3) is located in Elsdon, Porirua. The centre was established in 2011 and is one of three services owned by a family business. The service provides education and care of children aged from birth to school age. A key feature of the service is the Samoan language and culture, and Christian values underpinning the service‚Äôs philosophy.</p><p>The centre is managed by a governance team that represents the three services. Each service has a manager and two team leaders, one for the up-to-two age group and one for the children over two years old. Three of the eight staff are registered teachers.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience many opportunities to hear Samoan language through prayers, songs and their interactions with adults. Families are encouraged to participate in their child‚Äôs language learning. Samoan culture and identity are valued. These features are strengths of the centre.</p><p>There are times during the day where teachers engage well with children and relate to them in nurturing, caring and affirming ways. At other times their practices are of a more supervisory nature.</p><p>Managers agree that positive relationships are the key to successful early childhood experiences. Centre managers have recently networked with community providers to support families‚Äô understanding of health issues. This initiative should be beneficial for children‚Äôs wellbeing and for promoting their readiness for learning.</p><p>Teachers supervise children well. They provide some fun play activities for children to choose from in the indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers could improve children‚Äôs learning experiences by encouraging them to talk about their play and extending their learning.</p><p>The centre continues to develop its education and care programme. As part of this work, the centre director has documented a comprehensive philosophy and self-review model that is based on a Samoan cultural context. In order for these documents to be useful, staff now need to develop a shared understanding of what they mean for their daily practice in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further improve outcomes for children, ERO‚Äôs review findings indicate that centre managers should access external support to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen management systems to provide clear, well monitored guidelines for centre managers</li>
<li>help staff develop shared understandings of best teaching practice and to improve the assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>establish self-review practices that focus on promoting positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>ensure centre programmes include recognition of the place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Samoana Early Education Development Service (SEEDS AA3) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to police vetting, self review and curriculum implementation. To meet requirements the service's managers must:</p><ul>
<li>support teachers to provide a responsive curriculum that is consistent with <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>develop effective, ongoing self-review practices for evaluating all centre operations</li>
<li>implement effective human resource management practices, including documented selection and appointment processes, police vetting, job descriptions, induction, appraisal, professional development, misconduct, discipline and dismissal procedures.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1-4; PF20; GMA 4,6,7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Samoana Early Education Development Service (SEEDS AA3) will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>16 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
