</table><p>Young &amp; Amazing¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Young &amp; Amazing is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 95 children, including 35 aged under two years. Infants and toddlers have separate indoor and outdoor play spaces. Older children are grouped according to age, in two separate rooms with access to a shared outdoor play space. The roll includes small numbers of MƒÅori children, and children from a wide range of diverse cultures.</p><p>The centre is owned by an experienced early childhood teacher. She leads a team of nine qualified teachers, including a head teacher in each room. A consistent group of teachers, some in training and some unqualified, are employed in each room as full-time teachers or relievers, and to cover teachers' breaks. An externally appointed curriculum mentor and leader works alongside the teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre is strongly focused on providing enriching environments to support children's learning. The bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand is valued. Teachers commit to working together with families to support children to be confident in their culture, language and identity. <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is acknowledged as a guiding document.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report acknowledged teachers' respectful and caring interactions with children. It also noted the well-presented learning environments, and the way the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and children's cultural identities were celebrated. These positive aspects of practice have been maintained. Areas for development included assessment, planning and evaluation, self review and the alignment of teachers' appraisal goals with the centre's strategic vision. There have been improvements in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive and respectful relationships with adults. Children settle to play quickly and appear relaxed in the centre environment. Their easy access to learning resources encourages them to investigate and explore their surroundings.</p><p>Consistent staffing supports the wellbeing of all children. Children confidently approach teachers to share their ideas and discoveries, or for comfort. Teachers know the communication styles of infants and toddlers very well. They work at the level of these younger children and follow their home routines. Effective teaching strategies support children to develop social competence. Older children play well together, sustain their play and demonstrate they can manage social situations.</p><p>Children's cultures are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers proactively and regularly integrate te reo MƒÅori into centre routines. Leaders and teachers show a commitment to strengthening their bicultural practices through ongoing professional development.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to ensure positive outcomes for children. They make considered decisions about the layout and content of the learning environments. Many become partners in children's play and provide resources that encourage children's more complex thinking. Teachers model creative language and new vocabulary well.</p><p>Programme planning documents individual children's interests. Teachers deliberately plan experiences to support children's learning. They could now focus on recording each child's individual learning more clearly in assessment portfolios.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau share information about their cultures and their aspirations for their children's learning. This information could be used to support the continued development of partnerships with whƒÅnau that focus on children's learning.</p><p>The service is well managed with a strong focus on the wellbeing of children and their whƒÅnau. A consultant has worked with the centre owner and teachers for a sustained period of time, carefully guiding teacher practice. It is timely now to consider further leadership opportunities for head teachers to continue to build their knowledge and skills in this area.</p><p>An effective process for internal evaluation has been established. Relevant topics are investigated by the four teaching teams. There are some good examples of the process in action. These could be shared across the team to support consistent good quality practices. Ongoing documentation of progress towards meeting strategic goals would more accurately guide the centre's future direction. A framework of policies and procedures guides centre practices and a review cycle has been established.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop programme planning and assessment processes to ensure a rich curriculum is documented for each child, in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and implementing a process of programme evaluation based on the impact of teaching practice on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Young &amp; Amazing completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>9 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
