</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE is administered by NgƒÅti Ruanui Tahua Limited, which is a subsidiary of Te Runanga o NgƒÅti Ruanui situated in Hawera. The centre is an all-day kaupapa MƒÅori-based early learning service licensed for up to 40 children, including 10 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 28 tamariki on the roll, with 21 identified as MƒÅori.</p><p>Day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the centre manager, who also supports the teaching team.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report identified concerns around the service's capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Improvement was needed in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management and appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre received targeted support through a Ministry of Education (MoE) funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE developed a plan to address the key areas requiring improvement, in consultation with the MoE. Limited progress has been made in addressing concerns.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki experience warm and respectful relationships. Teachers are kind and responsive. They work collaboratively to support children's participation and learning. Literacy, mathematics and science are integrated in the programme in suitable play-based ways.</p><p>Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are highly promoted and well established in the service. Teachers use both te reo MƒÅori and te reo PƒÅkehƒÅ in their learning conversations. Waiata MƒÅori are a regular and enjoyed part of the programme. Whakapapa and whƒÅnau aspirations are well known and valued in the centre.</p><p>Teachers have accessed professional learning and development to support their approach to planning for learning. The impact of this learning has yet to result in improved understanding and a sustainable process.</p><p>The learning programme requires enhancing particularly in relation to provision:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>of opportunities for children to be creative and expressive and persist in their play over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of sufficient staff to meet toddlers' needs, particularly at meal times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for children requiring additional learning support.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have worked with an external provider to develop a framework for undertaking self review. However, their practice has not been sustained over time in relation to supporting decision making about teaching and learning.</p><p>Staff have developed an appropriate appraisal process that contributes to teachers' growth and development. Key next steps for strengthening this process across the teaching team should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provision of focused observations of teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning the centre manager's appraisal process with professional teaching requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updating the appraisal guidelines to reflect current practice and consistency of implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service has a strong commitment to whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi. Leaders and teachers recognise the importance of providing a learning kaupapa that is influenced by the aspirations that NgƒÅti Ruanui iwi have for their tamariki and mokopuna.</p><p>Establishing clear, specific, and measurable strategic goals that focus on improving outcomes for tamariki's learning requires development. Strengthening systems and processes that enable the centre manager to report on the service's performance against its strategic priorities is needed. This would enable management to make informed decisions for resourcing for learning and staffing requirements.</p><p>Key areas requiring further development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the learning programme for tamariki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resourcing to support teachers to plan and implement the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for teacher development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>management and leadership of the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clear, specific and measurable strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems for reporting to governance and management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing understanding of the purpose and use of internal evaluation for improvement to teaching and to children‚Äôs outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to: curriculum; governance and management and health and safety. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning needs, their interests, whƒÅnau, and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of self review helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a system in place for the recording of emergency drills carried out and evidence of how evaluation of the drills has informed the annual review of the service‚Äôs emergency plan. <em>(Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: C2; GMA6; HS8)</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Over the last six months the centre has gone through a large number of staffing changes. As a result of this management should continue to evaluate the impact of these changes on staff and children's learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui ECE. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Puawaitanga o Ngati Ruanui will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting) Te Tai Pokap≈´ - Central Region</p><p>24 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services.</a></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
