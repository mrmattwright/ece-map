</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindy Cottage Childcare is a well-established service that provides full day programmes in a home- like environment in Mairangi Bay, Auckland. It is licensed to provide for up to 38 children, including up to 12 children aged under two years. The community attending the centre is predominately NZ European/PƒÅkehƒÅ and Chinese, with a small number of children who are MƒÅori or of other ethnic backgrounds. A team of seven teachers, led by the centre manager, results in good staff-to-child ratios.</p><p>The indoor learning area has separate dedicated spaces for babies and children aged under two and a half years, and for children aged from two and a half years to school age. The recently upgraded outdoor activity area is shared by the two age groups. This provides children with opportunities to play for periods of time in mixed age groups.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on creating an environment where children are ready, willing and able to learn. Links to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are identified along with the team‚Äôs commitment to successfully meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse community.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report commented on the warm and caring interactions between teachers and children. The centre has continued to build on the findings of this report, sustaining existing good practices, strengthening centre appraisal and self-review processes, and developing a greater bicultural focus.</p><p>Recent professional development focusing on programme planning further promotes ongoing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm and respectful relationships are evident between children, parents and staff. Unhurried parent and staff interactions help foster children‚Äôs sense of wellbeing and belonging. Older children display independence and involve themselves in self-directed play activities. These self management skills should assist children when they transition to school.</p><p>Children can access a wide range of resources and have many opportunities to make choices about their play. Children enjoy exploring the play areas and socialising together. Teachers are now considering ways to deepen the complexity of play and children‚Äôs thinking in the learning programme.</p><p>Children aged up to two years are settled and comfortable with their teachers, and benefit from warm interactions with a dedicated carer. The open-plan indoor environment allows younger children to be visually connected with the older age group.</p><p>The centre provides a formalised transition to school programme for older children. Centre leaders are mindful of the need to maintain a balance between formal and informal play-based learning opportunities and they plan to review this transition programme.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of resources in the programme. Teachers working with both age groups could now consider ways to present and use equipment to maximise children‚Äôs interests and further challenge their thinking.</p><p>There is a good mix of experienced and recently qualified teachers who work well together. They readily communicate with each other and respond quickly to children‚Äôs needs. Most teachers have been with the centre for many years, and know the children, families and community well. Teachers acknowledge and reflect children‚Äôs cultures. Bilingual teachers effectively support some children and families in their first language.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme together, focusing on learning dispositions that reflect the strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Some teachers skilfully use rich conversations and careful and responsive questioning to prompt children‚Äôs thinking. Centre leaders and teachers are aware that continuing to deepen all teachers' conversations with children is likely to enhance their learning.</p><p>Additional to children‚Äôs assessment portfolios, stories about children‚Äôs learning are now being documented electronically. This development gives parents increased information about their children‚Äôs experiences and learning. This could also help the centre to further strengthen parent and whƒÅnau partnerships.</p><p>The centre has a strong bicultural focus that continues to be an integral part of the centre‚Äôs strategic plan and professional development programmes. Some staff integrate te reo MƒÅori confidently in conversations with children. The centre continues to use the strengths of parents and whƒÅnau to support MƒÅori content in the programme.</p><p>The centre benefits from capable administrative management. The owner and centre manager meet regularly and work well together. Management planning is sound and places an emphasis on the continued professional development of staff. This has had positive impacts on self review practices and teacher appraisal, and on supporting centre leaders and teachers to make ongoing improvements to centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders have identified the following next steps for centre development:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a teacher responsible for overall curriculum leadership</li>
<li>planning for learning experiences that will further challenge children‚Äôs thinking</li>
<li>reviewing the impact of the afternoon ‚Äòschool room‚Äô programme</li>
<li>using the most effective aspects of the afternoon programme throughout the day</li>
<li>considering ways to further develop partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Cottage Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindy Cottage Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
