</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Mount Maunganui provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is arranged into two separate areas, one for infants and toddlers (P≈´keko Nest) and one for older children (Kea Room). Transitions between these areas are based on children's readiness and parent preferences. At the time of this ERO review 67 children were enrolled, including 20 of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>The centre philosophy aspires to provide an environment that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>is calm, safe, respectful and homely, which celebrates individuals and unique cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develops children's sense of belonging as they learn alongside one another, having opportunities to be creative, expressive and develop independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offers spontaneous and intentional teaching and learning experiences, where the 'Be School Ready' initiative is interwoven throughout the inquiry-based curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is loving and caring, where kaiako build relationships with parents, family and whƒÅnau, inviting them to share in their child's learning journey.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare, which provides policy guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management. Professional guidance and development for staff is provided through appraisal which includes teacher inquiry, internal reviews such as the Quality Education and Care audit (QEC) and professional learning opportunities. The centre is supported by both the BestStart business manager and professional services manager, who work collaboratively to enhance centre leadership and growing teachers‚Äô capability to implement ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô. They also support the implementation of centre specific vision and strategic goals. These goals cover staffing, finances, curriculum, resource and premises, communication and consultation with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>Since ERO's previous review, centre leadership has remained constant. However, there have been significant changes to the teaching team, including new head teachers in both rooms. In the last 12 months there has been significant centre-wide professional learning development about curriculum design and implementation, including teachers' practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre receives high levels of support and informed guidance from the BestStart professional services and business managers. Within BestStart there are well-developed, self-review systems that contribute to a culture of improvement. Managers have recognised the need to review leadership structures and capabilities within the centre. This review is likely to result in a better informed and collaborative culture of learning for children, teachers and the parent community.</p><p>Recent philosophy and curriculum review have contributed to teachers' greater understanding of underlying principles of the philosophy. Observable teaching practices now include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>noticing and responding to children's interests, strengths and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inclusive, respectful interactions and positive guidance strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intentional teaching that adds depth to learning when teachers are involved in children's self-initiated play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased awareness and understanding of MƒÅori language, culture, and whƒÅnau and iwi aspirations for tamariki MƒÅori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment and teaching practices in the P≈´keko Nest that are underpinned by parent aspirations, teachers' understanding of children and the values of aroha, manaakitanga and whanaungatanga.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These noticeable shifts in practice are supported by ongoing professional sharing that is leading to more reflective practice to enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers develop positive and respectful relationships with children, their parents and families. These relationships are supporting children's wellbeing and sense of belonging. In keeping with the centre philosophy teachers understand the importance of reciprocal sharing of information to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Review of the centre environment is contributing to the quality of the curriculum. Improved layouts, equipment and resourcing are enabling children to make choices, set their own challenges, and engage in sustained and more complex play. In the P≈´keko Nest children benefit from the calm and secure environment where there is space and time for them to lead their own learning.</p><p>The centre gives priority to promoting children's health and physical activity. These aspects of children's positive growth, development and learning are evident in the provision of nutritious food and the programme experienced by children.</p><p>Teachers are providing many meaningful opportunities for children to experience early literacy and mathematical learning. They actively listen to children, acknowledge their verbal and non-verbal communication, and model good oral language. Children's love of books, stories, singing, and interest in numbers and mathematical concepts are actively fostered by teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has a well-documented appraisal process that closely aligns to BestStart expectations. Further work, development and learning with teachers is now necessary to consistently implement the teacher inquiry aspect of the process.</p><p>A critical priority for the centre is to establish effective centre-wide leadership. It will be important to grow the collective capability of the new leadership team to lead learning for the centre.</p><p>Review of the centre philosophy by the leaders and teachers is needed to lead to a shared understanding and expectations for teaching and learning across the centre. This is likely to result in a more cohesive centre-wide approach to teachers' practice, curriculum implementation and continuity of learning for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Mount Maunganui completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Mount Maunganui will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>23 May 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
