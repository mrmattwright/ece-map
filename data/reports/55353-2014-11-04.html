</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Seven Dwarfs Childcare Centre is a community based early childhood centre in Hastings, Hawke&rsquo;s&nbsp;Bay. It is managed by a community trust. The programme and teaching practices are influenced by the Rudolf Steiner philosophy. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for up to 20 children, including eight up to two years old.</p><p>The centre was placed on a provisional licence by the Ministry of Education in April 2013. A full licence with a roll increase to 20 children was granted in August 2013.</p><p>Since the June 2012 ERO report, the centre has undergone extensive refurbishment of both the indoor and outdoor environment. Areas of non-compliance and recommendations relating to building maintenance and repair, teaching practice and children&rsquo;s access to resources have been addressed. Other recommendations, including those in relation to assessment of children&rsquo;s learning and self review still require development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of Seven Dwarfs Childcare Centre is highly evident in practice. Teachers show they value the Rudolf Steiner curriculum approach and are committed to young children's wellbeing. A carefully considered and resourced environment contributes significantly to the promotion of the Steiner philosophy.</p><p>Well-established routines are responsive to children&rsquo;s rhythms and enable them to anticipate significant events during the day. These include arrivals, daily activities and meal times. Children interact positively with their peers and adults. Relationships are highly respectful in a calm centre environment.</p><p>Children show care and concern for one another. They play together cooperatively. Staff are responsive to their needs. Unhurried conversations support children&rsquo;s interests and curiosity. Infants and babies are nurtured and form close attachments with their key teacher. Children with special needs are well supported.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practices to support children&rsquo;s learning are developing. Since the previous ERO review, teachers have had external support to grow their knowledge and understanding. New assessment and planning frameworks are being developed. This includes enacting the Steiner philosophy in response to parent feedback. Teachers recognise the need to continue to strengthen their assessment and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning. ERO agrees this is an appropriate next step to help teachers more purposefully respond to individual and group interests.</p><p>Self review is in the early stages of development. Leaders understand the value of self review as a tool for continuous improvement. There is a cycle of policy review to guide centre operations. Self review is used to inform resourcing and environment decisions. A key next step is to strengthen the use of self review for curriculum and teacher practice.</p><p>Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre. Their aspirations to educate their children in a Steiner philosophy provide partnership opportunities to support consistent approaches at the centre and home.</p><p>Bicultural practices are woven throughout the rhythms of the day. Teachers have not yet developed a shared understanding of success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori. A key next step is for centre leaders and trustees to take a more strategic approach to determining what this will look like at Seven&nbsp;Dwarfs Childcare Centre.</p><p>Specific consideration should be given to reflecting the language and culture of Pacific children and their families in the programme.</p><p>Staff appraisal is developing. A useful process has been introduced. At the time of the ERO review a full cycle had not yet been completed. With robust implementation, the process is likely to support teacher growth.</p><p>Centre leaders show a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. They have given priority to determining how <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, can be woven throughout a Rudolf&nbsp;Steiner philosophy. They have accessed external support to grow their leadership skills. Trustees should provide strategic support to help them continue to develop their leadership capabilities. This should help to reflect the centre&rsquo;s priorities and promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>success for M&#257;ori, as M&#257;ori</li>
<li>provisions for Pacific children and their families</li>
<li>centre leadership to support ongoing improvements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Seven Dwarfs Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Seven Dwarfs Childcare Centre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>4 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
