</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Sprouts Montessori Pre-School is a small privately owned education and care service located in Whakatane. The owners provide effective governance, management and leadership of the service through clearly defined roles. The principal has overview of the philosophy and leads curriculum implementation and teaching practice. The business manager oversees financial, property and human resource management.</p><p>The centre roll of 51, includes 26 MƒÅori children and others from diverse cultural backgrounds. Two age-grouped classrooms and shared outdoor play areas cater for children from 9 months to school age. Through the centre philosophy, each child is viewed as a special and unique treasure needing to be recognised for who they are. The philosophy aims to support children to be confident, independent and capable learners. The centre follows the Montessori Method of teaching and learning, interwoven with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 review the centre owners and teachers have made significant progress in areas for development related to, consistently implementing the Montessori approach, leadership, relationships, appraisal and professional support. Centre owners recognise the need to continue to build the quality of strategic planning and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The intent of the centre's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children have many opportunities to focus for sustained periods of time on interests of their own choosing. Skilled, responsive teachers work alongside children, giving them time and space to set challenges and solve problems in a calm and respectful environment. The classrooms are well presented with graduated equipment and materials that add complexity to childrens' learning, promote their independence and build their early literacy and mathematical knowledge. Teachers nurture children up to 3 years in a home-like setting. Older children enjoy taking responsibility as tuakana, including younger children in their play and learning routines.</p><p>The curriculum is well designed to provide rich learning experiences for children. Priority is given to making links with the wider community and promoting childrens' self-care and good health. Routines are well established, managed and understood by children, while being flexible and responsive to individual children's care and learning needs. Strong positive and trusting relationships are evident among teachers, families, whƒÅnau and children. Transitions into and within the centre, and school are well planned and sensitive to each child's readiness. Parents express appreciation for the strong sense of wellbeing and belonging that is fostered through genuine relationships and thoughtful routines and transitions.</p><p>Teachers embrace opportunities to acknowledge the identities, languages and cultures of children and their families. Centre management and teachers value and integrate aspects of MƒÅori culture that promote success for MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau. They demonstrate an ongoing commitment to building their knowledge of te reo MƒÅori and culturally responsive teaching practice. There is a strong emphasis caring for Papatuanuku and learning about the natural world in real-life contexts. Families and whƒÅnau make a significant contribution to enriching the curriculum and childrens' learning.</p><p>Teachers gather a wide range of information about children's learning and development in individual assessment journals. These are regularly shared both with families and children. Teachers use this information effectively to plan learning experiences for the group and individual children.</p><p>The teaching team is professional and collegial. They clearly articulate in-depth understanding of, and commitment to, the Montessori Method of teaching and learning. Teachers enthusiastically participate in relevant and good quality professional learning and development and share current research with one another. Centre owners value and promote teachers' professionalism, provide ongoing feedback about practice and foster links within the wider education community. Children and families benefit from the way teachers continually grow their professional knowledge and practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to sustain centre improvement and development attention should now be given to strengthening self review and strategic planning frameworks and processes. This should enable centre owners to take a longer term view of centre development and monitor progress toward specific goals relating to the intent of the philosophy, expectations of the Montessori Method and regulatory requirements.</p><p>Consideration could be given to maximising the potential of children's capabilities through providing more complex challenges and opportunities for boys and other active learners in the outdoor environment.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Sprouts Montessori Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.¬† In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Sprouts Montessori Pre-School will be in three years.¬†</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 August 2016¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.¬†</p>
