</table><p>The management team needs to strengthen the quality of governance and management practices. Visiting teachers have identified that further development work is needed to support home educators plan and implement suitable learning programmes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cherish Childcare is a privately-owned, home-based education and care service located in New¬†Plymouth. It comprises one network catering for around 70 children aged up to five years. Of these, 16 are of MƒÅori descent. The service has been operating for two years.</p><p>Two visiting teachers support 16 educators to provide an educational programme for children in their homes. The owner oversees teachers‚Äô practice and, together with the administrator, service operation. At times, she undertakes a visiting teacher role.</p><p>Cherish Childcare has experienced significant changes this year. Two long-term visiting teachers and some educators left the service. New visiting teachers were appointed in June. Review and re-development of some aspects of teachers‚Äô and educators‚Äô practice, and operational management relating to staffing and quality assurance, have accompanied these changes.</p><p>Of the three qualified teachers, one is provisionally registered, one is subject to confirmation as a registered teacher and one has re-applied to re-register as a teacher after a non-teaching period.</p><p>Recent long-term, cluster-based external professional development has commenced to strengthen some practices and aspects of operation. The manager has recently accessed professional support to develop an advice and guidance programme for provisionally registered teachers and a strategic plan.</p><p>The development of close relationships, provision of safe environments for children, working in partnership with parents and acknowledgement of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi have been identified by the service as key to supporting improvements to practice.</p><p>This is Cherish Childcare‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Community outings and events organised by Cherish Childcare provide good opportunities for children to socialise with peers. Playgroups support educators and visiting teachers to plan activities for children together. Observations at playgroup affirmed these as a valuable time for building positive relationships between visiting teachers, educators and children.</p><p>The management team and visiting teachers agree they need to continue to strengthen understanding of MƒÅori culture, language and identity across the organisation. A strategic priority has been identified to build knowledge of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This work should help the service to better meet the needs of MƒÅori children and their whƒÅnau.</p><p>Placement procedures are suitably mindful of children‚Äôs wellbeing. An increasing range of equipment and materials support educators meet particular needs. Further work should be undertaken to develop guidelines and practices for educators working with children aged under two years and those with diverse learning needs. Links with appropriate people and community agencies are developed to aid some families who have English as a second language and a child in need of focused support.</p><p>Generally, educators‚Äô understanding of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and planning learning programmes are at an early stage of development. Children‚Äôs learning journals and visiting teachers‚Äô records show that educators have not been adequately supported to develop their practice. There is a need for a more systematic approach to supporting their understanding of requirements. This should include: improved guidelines and models; a stronger focus in teacher visits on observing educators working with children; and provision of constructive feedback to help them develop their practice. The new visiting teachers and managers are working well as a team to identify and address some issues. The use of an on-line programme is supporting some timely sharing of photos and stories with parents.</p><p>The owner has a strong commitment to improving the quality of the service. Recent professional support has aided the management team to identify some priorities for development. Educators are well supported and encouraged to gain a home-based education and care qualification. The management team works hard to initiate and maintain relationships with parents, visiting teachers and all educators. Carefully considered enrolment and induction procedures, and meeting and reporting processes, are in place. Some reflection and inquiry is undertaken by the owner and teachers to support effective decision making. The development and use of self review as an evaluative tool, to identify how well all practices promote better outcomes for children, should strengthen decision making.</p><p>Significant improvement to the quality of governance and management is needed to support ongoing development at all levels of the service. Considerable development work is needed in order to ensure all licensing requirements for home-based education and care are met. As a first step, the management team should collaboratively review and re-develop, with visiting teachers and educators, procedures and expectations to support their shared understanding of service and legal requirements. Further strengthening of the organisation and scheduling of the owner‚Äôs impromptu home visits should improve quality assurance.</p><p>The management team has not yet developed an effective performance management process to support improvement to teachers‚Äô practice, their attainment of full registration or attestation for reregistration. There is no suitable advice and guidance programme in place to support provisionally registered teachers meet criteria for full registration. The planned professional development should help the service address these issues.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management team and ERO agree that priorities for the service include the development of:</p><ul>
<li>an understanding of the principles of <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em></li>
<li>a more bicultural perspective across the service</li>
<li>educators‚Äô approach to planning suitable programmes for children</li>
<li>robust teacher performance management practices</li>
<li>practices and procedures to support better understanding of service and legal requirements</li>
<li>improved quality assurance processes</li>
<li>understanding and use of a more evaluative approach to self review</li>
<li>further, collaboratively identified strategic goals and actions to guide development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cherish Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified non-compliance relating to curriculum, governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service must improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>educators' and teachers‚Äô understanding of children‚Äôs learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>reflection of the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua</li>
<li>having in place, a system for regular teacher appraisal.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, C2, C4,C5,GMA6 ]</em></li>
</ul><p>The management team must ensure all teachers hold a current practising certificate. [<em>Education (Registration of Early Childhood Services Teachers) Regulations 2004]</em></p><p>In order to improve current practice the service should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>information is made available to parents about the amount and detail of the expenditure of any Ministry of Education funding received by the service</li>
<li>the police vetting process is rigorous and records are well organised</li>
<li>that a suitable budget guides expenditure</li>
<li>all educators hold a current first-aid certificate prior to commencing work.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Cherish Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>28 November 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
