</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Pace Education is a home-based education and care service. There are sixteen educators providing an in-home education and care service for children across Southland and Central Otago.</p><p>The owner, who is also a visiting teacher, is based in Alexandra. She regularly visits the educators and provides support for them. Another visiting teacher is employed, and is currently on maternity leave. Some children and educators have regular opportunities to attend playgroups.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified many areas that required further development, including areas of governance, leadership, teaching and learning. Some progress has been made in addressing these key areas. Most of these remain as areas for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from close and responsive relationships with their educators. Educators respond well to children's interests, routines and wellbeing. They plan a range of interesting learning experiences to extend children's learning, including visits into their local communities. These factors are contributing to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Children with particular learning needs are well supported through access to specific support services. Educators, teachers and parents work collaboratively to develop specific strategies and goals to support them to progress in their learning. Children are well supported to develop their communication skills. Educators support children to learn concepts about science, early literacy and mathematics. Infants and toddlers benefit from time to build relationships and develop their physical skills. Educators deliberately plan experiences to support children, in knowing about and understanding aspects of their bicultural heritage. Visiting teachers should continue to support educators to develop their understanding and use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>A clearly-developed vision and philosophy guides the service's practices. Visiting teachers and educators could more clearly show their valued outcomes for children's learning in the service's philosophy. They could then use these priorities for children's learning to guide both individual and group planning.</p><p>The visiting teacher has developed useful systems to build educator capabilities and to strengthen the focus on children's learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a focus on planning and assessment to ensure educators are planning to meet the needs, interests and learning goals of children, both individually and in groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responding to parents' aspirations for their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a focus on promoting bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting educators to develop a better understanding of Te WhƒÅriki (2017)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring educators have access to, and are promoting, a range of resources to support children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner/visiting teacher has developed useful strategic planning in consultation with her community, to set key priorities for the service. A short-term plan guides the service operations, however this needs significant development to clearly align to the long-term planned priorities, goals and actions. Progress towards achieving these should be regularly monitored, evaluated and reported on by the owner.</p><p>The owner/visiting teacher makes good use of networks to support and build professional connections. She ensures there are regular professional development opportunities and networks to share practices between educators. There are clear expectations and guidelines in place to support the induction of new educators to the service. To further build the capability of both visiting teachers and educators, the owner needs to develop a rigorous appraisal system. This needs to include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the development of clear guidelines for a regular and effective appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specific goals identified for all educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recorded robust feedback to support the development and progress towards the goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the process for endorsing teacher registration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner/visiting teacher uses internal evaluation to make useful improvements to practices. She needs to continue to develop her understanding and use of evaluative practices, and develop a schedule to ensure all aspects of practice are reviewed over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for the service owner, visiting teacher and educators are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a rigorous appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop internal-evaluation processes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently show how they are extending children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to support educators in developing their bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Pace Education completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Pace Education will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>21 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
