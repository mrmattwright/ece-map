</table><p>The service has been under new ownership and management for a relatively short time. While there are good quality programmes for children, managers are aware there is an urgent need to establish effective governance and management practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pasifika at Home 2 provides for children up to six years of age in South, Central and East Auckland. The 23 children enrolled are of Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>The Pasifika Homebased ECE service was purchased by Love of Learning Limited in January 2017. The service now has two Pasifika networks and a network that follows the Montessori philosophy. The management team includes two owners/directors and an operations manager, who is a registered teacher.</p><p>Two Pasifika network coordinators transitioned with the service to the new owners. Maintaining relationships with children, educators and parents/whānau has been a priority for the coordinators during this time of transition.</p><p>Currently in Pasifika at Home 2, eight educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. The coordinator is an experienced registered teacher and is highly skilled. She regularly visits educators and supports them to plan educational programmes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Pasifika at Home coordinators are guided in their practice by a belief in the importance of belonging, wellbeing, language, culture and identity. This belief is evident in their culturally appropriate and responsive practices and their focus on trusting relationships between educators, families and children, and between coordinators and educators.</p><p>Children's learning and involvement in a variety of experiences in the home and community are recorded in attractive portfolios. Documentation shows that children are developing a strong sense of cultural identity and are supported to use their first language. There is a deliberate focus on provision for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Dedicated educators provide a curriculum that is responsive to children's interests and family culture. It is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and aligned with service's philosophy. Coordinators are committed to working collaboratively with educators to promote play-based approaches to learning. There are regular coordinator meetings to plan programmes that are increasingly responsive to children's interests.</p><p>The coordinator demonstrates a good understanding of her role. Her records clearly show how she mentors and supports educators to grow their knowledge and understanding. Skilled educators keep good records that focus on children's learning. There is good evidence of useful educator appraisals.</p><p>The new management team is in the early stages of adapting the service's governance and management practices. The team is committed to learning about the requirements for operating a home-based service. Clear communications and open discussions between managers and coordinators have helped during the transition to new ownership.</p><p>The vision and philosophy of the service are currently being reviewed. The management team and coordinators have a good understanding about, and a genuine commitment to, <em>te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> and the place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa. Aligning this commitment with an understanding of Pacific cultural identity will help managers to strengthen this culturally responsive service for its diverse community.</p><p>There is a focus on continual improvement and building coordinator and educator skills and knowledge. New internal evaluation and performance management systems have recently been implemented. A standardised framework and better use of individual coordinator strengths across the networks will help to support effective induction and performance management systems.</p><p>Work is also underway to update the policy and procedural framework and to promote consistency across the owners' four home-based care and education networks. Systems for monitoring and following up health and safety concerns have been established but are not yet consistently implemented. A new strategic plan identifies very appropriate goals for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for coordinators include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>working with educators to document planning and assessment records that show individual children's progress and development over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering how they could increase the written contribution of parents to their child's learning programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for managers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing systems to ensure that personnel and health and safety requirements are being consistently monitored</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening bicultural practices across all levels of the organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working with coordinators to establish internal evaluation and performance management systems. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pasifika at Home 2 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.</em> In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pasifika at Home 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>23 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
