</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Papatoetoe provides all day education and care services for children in a renovated house. The centre is divided into two separate rooms to provide for infants and toddlers, and older children. Since ERO‚Äôs 2011 review a new centre manager has been appointed.</p><p>The service operates within the framework of Kidicorp systems, policies and procedures. Staff benefit from the guidance provided by Kidicorp managers. There is a clear focus on continual quality improvement through well established organisational review systems, targeted professional development and ongoing support.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the recommendations from ERO‚Äôs 2011 review. The refurbishment of the indoor learning environment has improved space available for children. Older children have easy access to a good selection of resources. Infants and toddlers are able to explore freely. The outdoor learning environment has been thoughtfully redeveloped and enhances the quality of children‚Äôs learning opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident explorers. They are encouraged to interact positively with each other and engage in activities that interest them. They have affirming relationships with their teachers and often persist at tasks independently or in collaboration with friends.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers are responsive to their cues and support them to become independent explorers. Calm and unhurried individualised care routines are evident.</p><p>Individual children‚Äôs portfolios provide an attractive and informative record of their developmental milestones and participation in the programme. Teachers analyse learning, particularly in relation to children‚Äôs developing dispositions. They use this information to plan programmes with children and parents.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value children‚Äôs diverse cultures, languages and identities in different ways throughout the programme. Children have many opportunities to celebrate their own and each others‚Äô cultures. The teaching team reflects the community diversity. Teachers use MƒÅori, Pacific and Hindi languages routinely throughout the day.</p><p>Teachers are focused on developing quality teaching practices to support children‚Äôs ongoing learning, wellbeing and development. They work collaboratively to reflect on and review programmes. Centre leaders value and respect teachers‚Äô work. Teachers would now benefit from support to strengthen their understanding of their role in extending children‚Äôs learning and in supporting older children to take a lead role in their learning.</p><p>Parents express appreciation for the care and support their children receive to develop socially and emotionally. The centre has established beneficial links with local schools to support its transitioning to school programme for older children.</p><p>Centre leaders keep up-to-date with developments in early childhood education. They actively support teachers‚Äô professional growth. The new centre manager is inclusive in her management style and a good role model for staff. She is committed to ongoing centre improvement and is well supported by the professional service managers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop self-review understandings, processes and documentation</li>
<li>building alignment between centre‚Äôs self review and action plans to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>extending the complexity of older children‚Äôs individual and spontaneous group play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Papatoetoe will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review officer Northern Select Region</p><p>22 January 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
