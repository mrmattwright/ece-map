</table><p>Well placed with ongoing external professional support for the leaders.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Salford Preschool provides education and care for children up to school age. The centre is one of two services that have the same owner/director. Salford has a leadership team of four with one being the overall centre manager. The service is licensed for 47 children and the centre is divided into two key areas. Children under two spend most of their time in the 'kiwi' room. Their separate outdoor play area is close to the over-two outdoor space. Children over two work and play in the 'Tuatara' room. Many of the teachers at Salford have worked there for many years and know the community well.¬†</p><p>There has been some progress since the 2012 ERO review but most of the recommendations still require further work. These include assessment and planning for learning, and bicultural development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly at the centre and are meaningfully involved in activities and experiences that they enjoy. They have warm and trusting relationships with their teachers and are very familiar with the well-established daily routines.¬†</p><p>A sense of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga is evident throughout the centre. The teachers organise events to involve the wider whƒÅnau and encourage parents to share their knowledge and skills. Parents‚Äô contributions are valued by the teachers and the children. Teachers support the aspirations parents have for their children‚Äôs learning. Leaders have a system in place to help ensure all teachers share knowledge about the children‚Äôs interests and learning.¬†</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children‚Äôs emotional and care needs. In the under-two area, the teachers provide a calm and settled environment for learning. This helps to enhance children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><p>Children have easy access to a range of equipment and resources appropriate for their development and can choose where they wish to play.</p><p>ERO observed conversations between teachers and children that support children's language development, thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p>The teachers are focused on children‚Äôs learning in the programme. Children have many opportunities for oral language development, literacy, exploration and risk taking. They have a wide and varied range of interesting and worthwhile learning experiences. These experiences are likely to challenge and extend their learning. Children have a range of regular excursions into the local community to build their sense of belonging and community. Older children participate in a ‚Äúbush‚Äù programme which is being trialled. This is providing new challenges for children‚Äôs learning. Wall displays and newsletters make learning visible for parents and provide opportunities for children to revisit their experiences.</p><p>Teachers are working to improve planning systems. This has been an ongoing issue and an effective system for individual children‚Äôs planning is yet to be established. The stories teachers write however, are useful and identify the learning that is happening. Group plans provide a clear learning focus for teachers when working with children.</p><p>The leaders and teachers do not yet have a clear, shared understanding about the key learning priorities they want to promote in this centre. When they are clear, they will be able to be more purposeful in the programme they provide. Leaders and teachers should work this out in partnership with parents.</p><p>Recent professional development has supported teachers to build on their knowledge and appreciation of Pacific cultures. Aspects of Pacific culture are now part of the daily programme. This year, teachers brought a Pacific flavour to the centre‚Äôs Polyfest performance.</p><p>Aspects of MƒÅori culture and language are evident in the daily programme such as waiata, karakia, and some te reo MƒÅori words and phrases. The teachers want to further their knowledge and confidence with MƒÅori language and culture. ERO has recommended in previous reports that the leaders work together to develop a planned approach to bicultural development by sharing and using the existing knowledge of the teachers. Without a planned approach it is unlikely that teachers will be able to build their confidence and skills and support children‚Äôs development more effectively in this area.</p><p>The director has developed a strategic plan that identifies three relevant priorities for development of the centre. These are: bicultural practices, sustainable practices, and building leadership. An action plan has yet to be developed to show how the strategic goals will be achieved across the two centres. An action plan will also help when monitoring progress.</p><p>The director manages the administrative component of the services. She regularly updates policies and keeps up to date with new information. She and her senior leadership team meet regularly. It would be helpful to focus these meetings more on leadership matters and on progressing the strategic goals.¬†</p><p>The director is receiving useful external guidance to help build her leadership skills. Leadership support should be continued and extended to the other centre leaders as well. The director has not yet developed clear expectations for her leadership team or standards for teaching practice. She must establish reporting systems that will assure her that expectations and compliance requirements are being met.</p><p>The director and centre leaders are working to strengthen appraisal processes. There is a new system in place this year that encourages teachers to reflect on their practice and regularly gather relevant evidence. The leaders need to continue to embed and strengthen appraisal practices and ensure they include observations in the process.</p><p>The Salford centre manager, senior leaders and teachers are improvement focused. They have begun to use some useful self-review processes resulting in positive outcomes for children. Leaders acknowledge the need to be more evaluative and make better use of indicators when they conduct reviews. They also need to develop a schedule for reviews to ensure those aspects of practice that impact most on children are reviewed regularly over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director should:</p><ul>
<li>access external professional support to develop leadership capacity within the service</li>
<li>establish clear expectations for the senior-leadership team and for teaching practice</li>
<li>implement systems to ensure expectations and compliance requirements are being met.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>in consultation with parents, identify the key learning priorities for children attending the centre</li>
<li>strengthen the planning system for individual children</li>
<li>implement a planned approach to bicultural development</li>
<li>build understanding and use of self review</li>
<li>develop a review schedule that includes the review of the quality of interactions against indicators of high-quality practice</li>
<li>embed and strengthen the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Salford Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the centre management should:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate evacuation drills and undertake them at different times</li>
<li>include contingency plans in risk-management systems for excursions outside the centre</li>
<li>analyse accident records to identify trends and patterns</li>
<li>create a database to monitor police-vet requirements for staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Salford Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
