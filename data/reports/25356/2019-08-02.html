</table><p>Kimberley Childcare Te Atatu¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kimberley Childcare Te Atatu is one of two services owned by the Kimberley Housing Charitable Trust. The service is licensed for up to 90 children, including a maximum of 20 under two years of age.</p><p>The centre operates in two separate buildings, with four age-related learning areas. One purpose-built building is for children up to three years of age, and the other two-storied building is for older children. At times during the day, teachers create opportunities for mixed-age play to support children's transitions across the centre.</p><p>A trust board representative liaises with the regional manager, who has oversight of the two services. The recently appointed centre manager works with seven other registered teachers including team leaders, and a number of untrained staff. Staff changes over recent years have impacted the teaching teams' ability to sustain and improve programme practices.</p><p>The Kimberley services' philosophy is values based, reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and includes recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi. It includes a focus on relationships, inspiring environments and support for children's social, emotional, spiritual and intellectual development.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report identified many positive practices and next steps related to strategic planning, teacher appraisal, documentation of management systems, and internal evaluation. ERO also recommended improving older children's access to the outdoors, and better access for children to their individual learning records. Good progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy well-resourced learning programmes in each of the four areas. Teachers engage actively and positively with children and plan learning opportunities that respond to children's strengths and interests. Teachers are keen to promote curiosity, perseverance and creativity through the programme, and set up activities that support learning through play. In each area, children are encouraged to be physically active and enjoy outdoor play.</p><p>The area for infants and toddlers is well supervised, with a high ratio of staff to children. Staff provide nurturing and gentle support that enables children to explore their surroundings and gain confidence in their interactions with others. Routines for babies and toddlers are managed effectively, providing reassurance for parents that children receive individual care.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well, respecting their cultural backgrounds and parents' aspirations. Bicultural learning contexts have been a focus for centre development, and teachers are developing confidence in using te reo MƒÅori in greetings, mat time activities and waiata. Teachers are able to use home languages to respond to some children from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers are developing inquiry skills as a result of planned professional learning. The focus on gathering evidence through the teacher appraisal process is helping teachers to reflect on their own practices and knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>. Future areas for inquiry could usefully include practices that grow leadership, in order to contribute further to positive outcomes for children. In addition, leaders could explore ways to sustain and build on benefits gained from professional learning and development.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to recognise children's learning dispositions. Children's individual assessment portfolios show their development over time and provide useful information to support their transition across age groups. Teachers encourage parents to contribute to their children's digital learning stories.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme and make good use of learning stories to develop children's current interests. As many of the staff are new, managers recognise that formal meeting times should be more consistently scheduled into centre routines. Team building is a key priority for strengthening programme planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>The trust board's vision, mission statement and strategic planning are clearly articulated and documented, and include guidelines for monitoring and measuring progress. The board supports ongoing professional development for leaders and teaching staff, and takes an interest in staff wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>arranging for the teaching teams to have regular and scheduled meeting times to plan and to evaluate learning programmes and the effectiveness of their practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that all staff, and particularly new staff, develop shared understandings about valued outcomes and extended learning through child-directed play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>growing leadership capability across the centre to ensure high quality practices, and centre-wide professional learning and development, are implemented consistently and sustained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building managers' and teachers' understanding and practice through improvement focused evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kimberley Childcare Te Atatu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>2 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
