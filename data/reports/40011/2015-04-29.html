</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pyes Pa Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service, located in a rural area close to Tauranga. It caters for children from birth to school age from the local and surrounding area, and operates two mixed-aged, morning sessions each week. The centre is licensed for 25 children including 10 under two years of age. The current roll of 17 includes one child who identifies as MƒÅori. A feature of the centre is its close relationship with the neighbouring school.</p><p>The playcentre operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (WBOPPA). Parents benefit from the support and guidance of a centre liaison officer and a centre administration officer provided by the association. WBOPPA also provides useful documentation and frameworks to guide centre operations. These guidelines are underpinned by the association‚Äôs philosophy that is highly evident in practice.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there have been changes in centre membership and in leadership roles. Significant improvements have been made to the indoor and outdoor environments, including repainting, erecting new shade areas, and improving equipment and resources to support children‚Äôs learning and play.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parent leaders and office holders are providing high-quality leadership and guidance for newer members. They work closely with association personnel in sharing ideas and knowledge to improve outcomes for children and their families. Parent members bring a wide range of educational and life experiences to the centre. They are appreciative of the support they receive from the association‚Äôs liaison officer who visits regularly and provides them with useful centre reports.</p><p>The centre programme is based on children‚Äôs interests that parents notice, recognise and extend. Children have easy access to all areas of play, which are well resourced and presented. They initiate their own play activities, and are well supported by parents who join in and build on children‚Äôs ideas. More experienced parents model good quality strategies and practices that promote positive outcomes for children. Attendance at workshops is resulting in improved confidence in allowing children to lead their learning.</p><p>Children are confident communicators and enjoy both independent and group play. They are confident in approaching adults and develop a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children experience literacy and mathematical learning opportunities using a wide range of appropriate resources and equipment. Their creative efforts are celebrated and displayed throughout the centre.</p><p>Parents are enthusiastic about documenting the learning that has occurred for their children. Children‚Äôs portfolios are attractive and well annotated, and provide a record of their involvement in the centre programme. Parents reflect at the end of each session and use their observations to help plan for future activities. A next step for parents is to build members‚Äô confidence in the writing of learning stories so that children‚Äôs portfolios can provide a record of learning over time.</p><p>Parents are increasing their understanding of the purpose of self review and have developed a planned approach to the review of areas of play. This has already contributed to significant improvements in many of the play areas and has involved parents in the process.</p><p>There are opportunities for members to undertake playcentre course training, and leadership roles. Tasks are shared among parents who are well supported to take on new responsibilities. Attention to succession planning is ensuring that important knowledge about playcentre operations is retained in the centre when key members leave. Centre members need to continue to increase their course training to ensure the continuation of the quality service that is already being provided.</p><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed into the centre each day. Relationships among parents are strong and supportive. Good communication and high levels of cooperation and team work are evident among parents. Transitions into the playcentre and on to the local school are well managed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre parents agree that important next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>incorporate te reo MƒÅori naturally and confidently into the programme</li>
<li>increase members‚Äô course level qualifications</li>
<li>more effectively document the outcomes of self review to show how children‚Äôs learning has benefitted.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pyes Pa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pyes Pa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
