</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Foxton Preschool and Nursery is a privately owned, all-day education and care centre. It is located at Foxton Beach and is licensed for 47 children including 18 up to two years of age. The children attending come from both the Foxton Beach settlement and the nearby town.</p><p>The centre is one of ten that are serviced by two visiting teachers. These teachers are responsible for monitoring the quality of curriculum provision and supporting teachers‚Äô ongoing professional learning and growth. A centre supervisor is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the service.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre curriculum, environment and resources provide children with a varied range of activities and learning experiences. Programme planning and assessment include reference to the strands and goals of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>.</p><p>Teachers support learners to follow their interests. They foster children‚Äôs language development, mathematical understanding and sustained attention to both child-initiated and adult directed learning goals. Young children welcome these opportunities to actively explore, talk about and engage in these experiences.</p><p>The centre has two distinct areas, one catering to children generally aged over two and another for those aged up two years. At the time of ERO‚Äôs visit the roll was not full and the ratio of adults to children was favourable in the up to two years old area.</p><p>Programme provision for these very young children focuses on nurturing their wellbeing through responsive care giving. Play is viewed as a vehicle for learning and opportunities are plentiful for these young learners to be active communicators and explorers.</p><p>Care routines were unhurried and are an enjoyable and integral part of children‚Äôs learning experience. As part of ongoing review and development the visiting teachers should ensure these outcomes continue as the roll increases, and as these children transition to the next learning area and programme.</p><p>Strategic planning, monitoring of progress and self review continue to evolve. Leaders and teachers have clear understandings of review for improvement.</p><p>A new appraisal process is being trialled. It is developmental and informs professional learning opportunities for staff. ERO‚Äôs evaluation confirmed that appraisal and advice and guidance programmes for beginning teachers require strengthening to improve outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders identify review of programmes of learning and the environment as next steps. ERO‚Äôs findings support review of the programme as appropriate and encourage the review be broadened to include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing agreed teaching practice to underpin the centre philosophy and determine curriculum priorities and emphasis</li>
<li>developing a philosophy for teaching and learning for the service‚Äôs youngest children</li>
<li>a review of literacy teaching and learning informed by the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the strand Communication-Mana Reo and its associated goals.</li>
</ul><p>ERO‚Äôs evaluation confirmed that building leadership capability of the visiting teachers and centre supervisor is necessary to strengthen the curriculum. Developing clearer expectations of and for best practice should help leaders and staff to explain and discuss their practice, improve self review and assist in building the service's evaluative capability.</p><p>The inclusion of te ao MƒÅori in the programme continues to develop. ERO‚Äôs evaluation findings confirm planning for and evaluation of this aspect of the programme requires strengthening. As part of the service's strategic development plans, visiting teachers and centre leaders should consider key education policy documents including:</p><ul>
<li><em>Ka Hikitia,</em> <em>Accelerating Success 2013 to 2017</em>. Acknowledging the aspirations for MƒÅori children and ascertaining those of whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi of the MƒÅori learners attending the centre is a next step</li>
<li>the <em>Pasifika Education Plan.</em> Acknowledging the aspirations for Pacific children and those of their aiga</li>
<li><em>TƒÅtaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of MƒÅori Learners</em> and how this might be incorporated into appraisal and attestation against the New Zealand Teachers Council Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Foxton Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service provider delegates responsibility for management assurance to the visiting teachers and centre supervisor. ERO found that this aspect of management and leadership requires improvement. While there are policies in place and these are reviewed, there are not always procedures to guide and monitor leaders‚Äô and teachers‚Äô practice. As a priority, visiting teachers‚Äô should progress this work.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Foxton Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>3 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
