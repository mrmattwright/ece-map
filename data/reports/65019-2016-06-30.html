</table><p>ABC Rangiora North is Well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Rangiora North operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education centres across New Zealand.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been some changes in staffing. During the last year, the manager has led two centres, working part time in each of them. She has recently returned full time to this centre in her manager's role. A new professional services manager was appointed at the beginning of 2016. The business manager has remained a consistent support to the centre during this time. Most staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Centre managers have been responsive to the recommendations from the previous ERO report. They have identified that while some good progress has been made they need to continue to refine group planning, and strengthen self-review and bicultural practices.</p><p>This centre has two separate learning areas to cater for the specific care and education needs of children from birth to school age. Significant improvements have been made to resourcing, equipment and the indoor and outside play areas.</p><p>The centre manager and staff are involved in the local learning cluster with other early childhood centres and schools, including the High School. The focus is on supporting the education of children in their community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Managers and teachers foster positive, respectful and inclusive relationships with children and families. Families are warmly welcomed and well supported to develop a good sense of belonging. Parents are actively encouraged to be involved in their children's learning and to be part of the centre community. The individual cultures and beliefs of families are respected and valued.</p><p>Teachers are attentive and responsive to the interests, strengths and capabilities of individual children. They help children make a positive transition into the centre, and between areas, through well-paced, personalised processes.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to the presentation of the environment to encourage exploration that is meaningful and enjoyable for children. Teachers follow children's interests and provide a wide range of interesting activities, including natural resources, to provoke children‚Äôs curiosity and involvement in the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers support children's confidence to work independently, and to play well with and to care for others. Children have many opportunities to learn about the natural world and be involved in physical play in the spacious outdoor areas. Teachers make purposeful links to the community to enhance the curriculum offered to children.</p><p>The specific needs of children under two years old are well supported by nurturing and caring staff and competent leadership in the nursery area. Children benefit from respectful and responsive interactions and routines.</p><p>Parents and whƒÅnau are well informed about children‚Äôs current learning interests and participation in the programme through attractive and informative wall displays, children‚Äôs individual profile books and online learning stories.</p><p>The teaching team has recently reviewed the centre philosophy to reflect teachers' shared teaching and learning values and beliefs, including an increasing focus on bicultural perspectives and practices.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The centre manager, business manager and professional services manager are knowledgeable and experienced. They work in partnership to implement BestStart systems effectively, including quality assurance, health and safety and strategic planning.</p><p>Managers have high expectations and specific strategies to build on teacher capability, reflective practices, and leadership skills. They lead systematic and collaborative self-review processes to inform centre priorities and teaching and learning. Regular and targeted professional development and mentoring is provided to staff to help build reflective and evaluative practices.</p><p>There is a strong shared focus on continuous improvement and promoting positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management team has identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen teachers' confidence and use of indepth evaluative inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and further develop planning and evaluation for individuals and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase bicultural perspectives in key documentation and centre practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified that the transition to school processes and practices could be strengthened.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Rangiora North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Rangiora North will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
