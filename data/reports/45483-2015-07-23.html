</tr></tbody></table><p>Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside provides for children from two years to school age. Bright Beginnings Montessori Nursery is in the same building.</p>
<p>The preschool and the nursery operate as one centre. They have the same management, systems and practices. The preschool has two classrooms for younger and older children. The two classes share a large outdoor area. The nursery has its own spacious classroom and outdoor play space. Nearly all the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Two staff members have a Montessori qualification.</p>
<p>The managers and teachers have made very good progress in meeting the 2012 ERO review recommendation to establish effective child assessment and programme-planning processes. Progress is being made to improve self review and staff-appraisal processes. Strategic planning remains an area for further development.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children participate in well-organised programmes that provide them with many opportunities to develop skills, knowledge and interests within the Montessori and the wider early childhood curriculum. Literacy, mathematics and music are well integrated into the class programmes. Many of the teachers regularly use te reo MƒÅori phrases in their conversations with children.</p>
<p>Managers and teachers place a strong emphasis on children developing good social and communication skills. Teachers model their expectations for child behaviour and respect for others. Children are friendly, inclusive, and listen carefully and respond appropriately to others.</p>
<p>Teachers use a good range of teaching approaches to help children extend their thinking and problem-solving skills. They listen, to and value children‚Äôs opinions and ideas. They give praise and encouragement. Children are confident and prepared to take risks in their learning to experience success and to acquire new skills.</p>
<p>The child profile books and planning records provide a comprehensive record of each child‚Äôs learning and the ways teachers promote ongoing success. The records consistently identify ways teachers support learning and clear next steps to extend and provide meaningful learning experiences. Teachers successfully include child and parent comments in the learning stories.</p>
<p>Child transitions into, within, and from the centre are well established and focus on the needs of each child and their family.</p>
<p>Children‚Äôs home cultures are recognised in the programme and teachers regularly use home languages with children. Parents are encouraged to share their language and culture with the centre to benefit all children.</p>
<p>Parents are valued as the first teachers and carers of their children. Managers and teachers use a range of effective ways to engage parents in their children‚Äôs learning and care, and to provide additional support whenever it is needed. The managers have high expectations for learning and teaching and value teachers as professionals. They actively promote leadership within the centre, and make good use of external expertise to strengthen systems, practices and understandings.</p>
<p>Managers provide teachers with good support, professional development and resources to continually improve their skills, knowledge and confidence. Team work and support is valued and well used to improve teaching practices and provide consistency in the use of the centre‚Äôs systems and practices.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The managers and ERO agree, that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include continuing to:</p>
<ul><li>strengthen te reo and tikanga MƒÅori and MƒÅori children succeeding as MƒÅori</li>
<li>promote Pacific language and culture</li>
<li>embed and develop the depth and usefulness of self review</li>
<li>provide more opportunities for children to develop their creativity in the programme</li>
<li>encourage teachers to complete Montessori training.</li>
</ul><p>The managers should also:</p>
<ul><li>develop a strategic plan to provide clear direction and priorities for achieving the centre‚Äôs vision.</li>
<li>review group times to ensure they support the centre‚Äôs philosophy for learning and teaching.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Bright Beginnings Montessori Brookside will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
