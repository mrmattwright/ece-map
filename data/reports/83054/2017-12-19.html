</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Polykids provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age. It is located on the Otago Polytechnic campus and is operated by the polytechnic. Children of polytechnic students and staff are given priority for enrolment.</p><p>The service is licensed for 54 children, including 20 children aged under two. The centre is about to undertake major renovations to join the areas for younger and older children. This is intended to enable more flexible use of the learning space and support fluid transitions between the infant and preschool programmes in the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states that it aims to 'promote children's communication and relationship skills through provision of a stimulating environment, supporting children's wellbeing and belonging, and co-constructing learning together with children.'</p><p>A new leadership team, of a centre manager and administration manager, has been appointed since the 2014 ERO review. The service has made good progress on addressing the areas identified for improvement in its last ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's wellbeing and sense of belonging are effectively responded to. Each child's interests, needs and preferences are well known by teachers. Teachers use this knowledge to plan activities and routines, and to adapt the learning environment to support children's learning and development. They maintain open and ongoing communication with parents in order to know about children's changing needs. Daily care routines are well managed and understood by children.</p><p>Children benefit from warm, responsive and respectful interactions with teachers. Teachers of preschoolers and infants allow space and time for children to lead their own learning, while offering choices about what might happen next. Teachers work constructively with parents, external specialists and education support workers to ensure children with additional needs can fully participate in learning alongside their peers.</p><p>The centre's curriculum responds well to children's interests and needs. Teachers plan programmes that link well to children's lives and build on children's interests. Children participate in regular walking excursions to explore their local environment - which includes the polytechnic where their parents are studying or working. The service's valued outcomes for children's learning are strongly evident in planning and assessment and in the programme. For example, teachers intentionally foster social and communication skills. Careful consideration is given to supporting those children getting ready to go to school to develop the social and self-management skills they need to adapt well to a new environment.</p><p>The new leadership team is well focused on improving the quality of education and care. To achieve this they have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>involved all teachers in meaningful and systematic self review to support improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>redeveloped the centre's strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoted shared understandings of the centre's philosophy, vision and goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developed leadership amongst teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthened the way staff works together.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders and ERO agree that next steps for this service are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend the way the service involves parents in children's learning, including by more frequently collecting and responding to parents' aspirations for their child's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' confidence and capability to respond to the cultures, identity and languages of children and their families, and to reflect these in the learning environment and programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop teachers' capability to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching and programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Polykids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the Otago Polykids management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consider simplifying the service's policy and procedure framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish and implement a schedule for policy and procedure review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve guidelines and practices for assuring that teachers have met all practicing teacher criteria in each year as part of their appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Polykids will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>19 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
