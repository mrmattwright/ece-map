</table><p>Kiwi Steps is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Steps is a privately owned early childhood service located in the South Waikato village of Whakamaru. It provides education and care for children from 3 months to school age. The centre is licensed for 50 children including 17 up to the age of two. It services the villages of Whakamaru, Mangakino and surrounding rural areas. This is the only teacher led English medium service in the area. At the time of this ERO review the centre’s roll of 61 included 25 children of Māori descent. The centre was opened in 2012 and this is its first ERO review. It is open from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm five days a week and operates two age-based rooms.</p><p>The centre owners provide a quality service for all children, their whānau and the wider community. They subsidise a bus from Mangakino village to enable families to access the service.</p><p>They have undertaken significant developments to the outdoor play area and, in response to demand, have added an extra building specifically for babies and young toddlers. The centre owners have a strong focus on incorporating te reo and tikanga Māori as a key component of the centre programme. This is reflected in the centre’s vision and mission statements: 'Ako, kata, tākaro, te Poutama o te Kiwi-learn, laugh, play, the Kiwi way'.</p><p>Since the centre opened there have been some changes in the teaching staff. Recently the centre manager moved out of the area, however she continues to be employed to provide ongoing professional guidance for teachers and the centre. The centre is currently operating a shared leadership model. Five out of the 10 teaching staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Several of the other teachers are either primary school trained or undertaking training in early childhood education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kiwi Steps is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children are happy and engaged. They benefit from participating in a programme that is a combination of teacher led and child initiated activities. They have many opportunities to explore their own interests and involve themselves in meaningful and sustained play. Children enjoy safe, physical challenge and opportunities to explore in the extensive outdoor play areas. There are opportunities for older children to play with and learn alongside their brothers and sisters and younger children in the shared playground. During activities such as “whānau time/wā whānau” and at the beginning and end of each day all children and teachers meet together. Children’s sense of belonging is promoted through safe and predictable daily routines.</p><p>Babies and toddlers benefit from nurturing relationships with teachers who effectively cater for their care needs. Teachers work in partnership with whānau to respond to and support each child’s individual routines. Consideration should now be given to supporting teachers to more effectively enhance children’s language development and learning through play and during care routines.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the inclusive approach and support for children with high health and learning needs. The centre funds additional staff to support the participation of these children in the centre’s programme.</p><p>The vision of the centre owner, the expertise of some staff and strong links with local iwi and whānau contribute to a strong Māori dimension in the centre. This supports the language, culture and identity of Māori children at the centre and builds all children’s understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Activities such as regular karakia, waiata and hīmene, and the learning of individual pepeha are important aspects of the daily programme enjoyed by children.</p><p>Other positive features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>excursions into the local and wider community</li>
<li>the effective integration of literacy and mathematics learning in children’s play</li>
<li>regular involvement of whānau to share their knowledge and expertise with children</li>
<li>Kāhu Kids/ Rōpu Kāhu – a programme for four year olds aimed at supporting their transition to school.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have established positive and useful relationships with children and whānau. They are developing processes to identify and document children’s learning and beginning to use this to provide experiences which extend on this learning. This information is shared with whānau via internet and paper based portfolios. Parents spoken to by ERO appreciated regular informal communication with teachers about their children’s learning and participation in the programme.</p><p>The centre owner has established an appropriate policy framework to guide centre operations. She makes generous provision for teacher professional learning and development. Along with centre leaders she has implemented a useful process of self review that has contributed to ongoing centre development and improvement. Parents report that their opinions about centre operations and programmes are regularly surveyed and responded to. A performance management system for teachers has been developed and implemented. ERO and the centre owner agree that this requires further strengthening.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that the key next step is to develop and implement a strategic plan with a focus on building teacher capability.</p><p>Particular attention could be given to centre-wide professional learning and development for teachers in the areas of:</p><ul>
<li>assessment and planning, including strengthening systems for gathering whānau aspirations</li>
<li>extending learning opportunities for babies and toddlers</li>
<li>promoting Māori language that will enable the centre to effectively fulfil its vision of developing children with high levels of proficiency in both English and Māori.</li>
</ul><p>Priority should also be given to further developing the centre’s resources in order to provide more opportunities for children to develop their creativity and engage with natural materials across a wider range of areas of play.</p><p>While there is an ongoing process of self review in place this could be strengthened by ensuring that any proposed changes are informed by current best practice in early childhood education.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Steps completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the course of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance. In order to address these the centre must:</p><ul>
<li>regularly maintain a hazard identification and management system <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Criterion HS 12]</em></li>
<li>ensure that all provisionally registered teachers receive an appropriate induction and mentoring programme. <em>[New Zealand Teachers Council, Registration Policy, Section 2, Part C]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Steps will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
