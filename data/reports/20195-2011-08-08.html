<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>The KidStart Eden-Roskill network has 15 educators and 70 children and is part of the KidStart Auckland Central home-based care service. The service comes under the umbrella of the Barnardos organisation, which provides management, operational frameworks and support personnel. Educators use their own homes to provide care for up to four children at any one time. Visiting teachers, qualified in early childhood education, regularly visit educators to provide support.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s settled and confident engagement in the programme reflects their sense of security and belonging in educators&rsquo; homes. Resources, which often reflect children&rsquo;s current play interests, are readily available. Children interact positively with each other and close friendships are evident.</p><p>Children are confident participants in weekly KidStart playgroups. These sessions provide opportunities for children to socialise with a wider group and to develop new skills. Playgroups are purposeful and visiting teachers ensure that children and educators benefit from attending. Most educators also take children on a variety of other outings during the week. Visiting teachers should continue to seek ways to ensure that all children can be included in outings.</p><p>Parents surveyed as part of this ERO review were very positive about the service provided and the programmes and experiences enjoyed by their children. Parents describe educators as caring and affectionate and appreciate the personalised care provided in home environments.</p><p>Close relationships between M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau, educators and visiting teachers are evident. M&#257;ori parents report that they value the extended family atmosphere of home-based care. An organisation-wide strategy is guiding the development of work to enhance practice and provision for M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Managers are experienced and capable and provide the service with good leadership. They encourage reflective practice and lead self review to guide service development. The collegial team of visiting teachers demonstrates a shared understanding of and commitment to the provision of high quality home-based care. Managers and visiting teachers promote programme improvement and support educators to improve their practice. Ongoing training and workshops that cater to educators&rsquo; needs support their professional growth. The KidStart Auckland Central service is well placed to sustain ongoing improvements in the service provided for children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of KidStart Eden-Roskill was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by KidStart Eden-Roskill to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidStart Eden-Roskill.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>KidStart Eden-Roskill provides a home-based care service for 70 children in the homes of educators. ERO visited 17 educators across the KidStart Auckland Central service.</p><p>Managers responded positively to ERO&rsquo;s June 2008 report. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation was used to inform and complement the service&rsquo;s own improvement focused self review.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Caring relationships. Educators provide children with personalised care and positive, inclusive relationships are evident. Friendships between children are apparent and lasting relationships between educators and parents often develop as educators become part of children&rsquo;s extended family. Children are well settled and interact confidently with visiting teachers, who know them well.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning. Children have good opportunities to learn through play, and educators often respond to children&rsquo;s interests with activities and resources. Flexible routines, time for uninterrupted imaginative play, and conversations that prompt children&rsquo;s thinking all contribute positively to children&rsquo;s engagement. Recent service-wide focuses on literacy and numeracy learning for older children, and on promoting, identifying and documenting children&rsquo;s learning, continue to have a positive impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Home environments. Children are provided with a wide range of experiences, activities and resources in educators&rsquo; homes. Play areas are well set up, with many resources readily accessible to children. Resources are supplemented by KidStart resource kits that enable educators to respond to children&rsquo;s specific interests. Visiting teachers could promote the use of child-size tables and chairs in all homes. Processes for monitoring health and safety are implemented well by educators and are monitored by visiting teachers.</p><p>Self review. KidStart managers lead purposeful service review. An evidence-based process that covers a wide range of topics and contexts has been established. Planned review occurs alongside spontaneous evaluations when the need arises. Greater involvement of educators would enhance current self-review processes.</p><p>Support and development. Service managers and visiting teachers form an experienced and committed team whose priority is improving children&rsquo;s care and education. Their shared philosophical approach to and understanding of high quality home-based care results in ongoing improvements in the service. Visiting teachers provide focused support and modelling to assist educators to develop their practice and the programme they provide. Their genuine encouragement builds educator confidence and capability.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Service development. Ongoing self review identifies appropriate areas for service improvement. ERO affirms the current focus on areas of development, which include:</p><ul>
<li>the establishment of transition to school procedures, with thought given to cultural expectations</li>
<li>formalising the implementation of the performance appraisal cycle and promoting more personal reflective practice for visiting teachers</li>
<li>documenting annual and strategic planning so that they are more useful tools to support implementation and monitoring.</li>
</ul><p>Assessment. Educators and visiting teachers contribute to &lsquo;My Book&rsquo; records for each child. These records are valued by children and families, and parents report that they enjoy taking the books home to share with the wider family. To enhance these records of children&rsquo;s learning, visiting teachers should support educators to:</p><ul>
<li>make links between assessment stories so that they more clearly show children&rsquo;s learning and development over time</li>
<li>find ways to seek and add comments and feedback from parents</li>
<li>reflect children&rsquo;s culture and ethnicity.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>KidStart Eden-Roskill currently has seven M&#257;ori children enrolled.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Close relationships between M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau, educators and visiting teachers are evident. M&#257;ori parents report that they value the extended family environment of home-based care.</p><p>An organisation-wide strategy for enhancing practice and provision for M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau guides development in the service. This strategy:</p><ul>
<li>outlines the service&rsquo;s commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi</li>

<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice, service managers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>all notices to parents about trips outside the educator&rsquo;s home include the ratio of adults to children</li>
<li>evacuation practices for fire and earthquake are conducted on different days.</li>

</table><p>8 August 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidstart-eden-roskill" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of KidStart Eden-Roskill</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onThe KidStart Eden-Roskill network has 15 educators and 70 children and is part of the KidStart Auckland Central home-based care service. The service comes under the umbrella of the Barnardos organisation, which provides management, operational frameworks and support personnel. Educators use their own homes to provide care for up to four children at any one time. Visiting teachers, qualified in early childhood education, regularly visit educators to provide support.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s settled and confident engagement in the programme reflects their sense of security and belonging in educators&rsquo; homes. Resources, which often reflect children&rsquo;s current play interests, are readily available. Children interact positively with each other and close friendships are evident.</p><p>Children are confident participants in weekly KidStart playgroups. These sessions provide opportunities for children to socialise with a wider group and to develop new skills. Playgroups are purposeful and visiting teachers ensure that children and educators benefit from attending. Most educators also take children on a variety of other outings during the week. Visiting teachers should continue to seek ways to ensure that all children can be included in outings.</p><p>Parents surveyed as part of this ERO review were very positive about the service provided and the programmes and experiences enjoyed by their children. Parents describe educators as caring and affectionate and appreciate the personalised care provided in home environments.</p><p>Close relationships between M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau, educators and visiting teachers are evident. M&#257;ori parents report that they value the extended family atmosphere of home-based care. An organisation-wide strategy is guiding the development of work to enhance practice and provision for M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Managers are experienced and capable and provide the service with good leadership. They encourage reflective practice and lead self review to guide service development. The collegial team of visiting teachers demonstrates a shared understanding of and commitment to the provision of high quality home-based care. Managers and visiting teachers promote programme improvement and support educators to improve their practice. Ongoing training and workshops that cater to educators&rsquo; needs support their professional growth. The KidStart Auckland Central service is well placed to sustain ongoing improvements in the service provided for children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
