</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro is one of 71 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten provides education and care for children two years and over.</p><p>In 2016, there were significant changes in the kindergarten leadership and the teaching team. However, these have been well managed by the association. All teachers are fully qualified and certified in early childhood education. Teachers have recently reviewed the curriculum priorities to align them more closely to MƒÅori values.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the West REAP Transition to School Network of local schools and early childhood services. Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro has recently been recognised as a Bronze Enviroschool.</p><p>The education services manager and teachers have addressed the recommendations outlined in the 2012 ERO report and continue to build on good practice. This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergartens in the Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled. They work well together as they explore the interesting play areas in the spacious, well-resourced natural environment. Children experience positive, respectful relationships with each other and their teachers. They are effectively supported to develop social skills, self-help and independence skills.</p><p>Children are positively encouraged to care for themselves, each other and the kindergarten. They have meaningful experiences to enhance their learning about sustainable practices and the natural world. Teachers support children to make meaningful links to the local area and reflect these in the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted time to explore interests and extend their ideas. They have many opportunities to focus on real work as part of their project-based learning.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for children, parents and whƒÅnau. Transitions into the kindergarten and on to school are flexible and well supported. Teachers give purposeful support to children with additional needs and work closely with families and relevant external agencies.</p><p>Teachers notice and respond to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and abilities. They listen carefully to children and encourage them to express their ideas clearly. Teachers seek and value children‚Äôs contributions to decisions made in the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers provide a suitable range of physical challenges for children. They give thoughtful consideration to integrating literacy, numeracy, science and the arts into the daily programme. Teachers are giving increasing emphasis to including bicultural practices in their teaching.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children‚Äôs participation and learning through assessment, extensive wall displays and digital technology. Teachers seek and value parents‚Äô views. They encourage parents to spend time at the kindergarten and contribute to the learning programme. Teachers are effectively building reciprocal relationships with the wider Greymouth community.</p><p>Teachers work well together. They effectively use a systematic approach to internal evaluation and are strongly focused on promoting positive outcomes for children. Teachers are committed to continually reflecting on and improving their teaching practice.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is well supported by an experienced, professional board. The association has a well-understood vision and targeted strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. Teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the association and their own kindergarten objectives and vision, to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes the appointment of a kaitautoko to further promote a strong focus on Tiriti aspirations at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in the wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The education services manager, teachers and ERO agree, that the key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices in the learning programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the updated appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The chief executive has identified and ERO‚Äôs evaluation has confirmed, that the key next step for the association is to continue its property improvement long-term plan, ensuring that enhancements reflect the changing needs of its communities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Karoro will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer, Southern - Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 March 2017¬†</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.¬†</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
