</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children’s Garden Preschool is an all-day education and care service located in Welcome Bay, Tauranga. It is a small, family-orientated centre that caters for three and four year old children. The centre is one of three owned by a private company. The nearby Children’s Garden Childcare operates under the same management and governance systems and there is regular movement of staff between the centres. The current roll of 26 children includes six who identify as Māori. The owner/licensee employs a centre manager, a head teacher and three full-time and part-time staff. All teachers have an early childhood qualification and over 80% are registered teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes a programme of learning and development where children have opportunities to develop knowledge, respect and explore their community. Teachers believe that children learn through free play and imitation of others. The philosophy also documents the intent to teach respect and appreciation of the natural world. The programme includes regular activities beyond the centre environment.</p><p>Staff have worked hard to address the areas for review and development identified in the 2012 ERO report related to strategic and annual planning and personnel management.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner and centre manager are providing effective governance for the service. The centre philosophy has been developed collaboratively and is regularly reviewed. The strategic direction is clearly documented and annual planning processes are well developed. This effective approach to strategic and annual planning is contributing to a shared understanding about the centre's purpose, and providing a sound foundation for ongoing improvement to the quality of education and care. There is an extensive range of procedures and policies that promote children’s health, safety and well being.</p><p>The centre leader strongly promotes a collaborative approach to leadership, the organisation of the programme and the learning environment. This shared approach is contributing to positive and effective working relationships amongst staff and high levels of team work throughout the centre. Since the previous ERO review, significant progress has been made in the development of staff performance management systems. These systems provide a documented and well-understood approach to sharing professional knowledge and improving teacher practice. Leaders have successfully established an approach to self review that is both spontaneous, planned and evidence based. There are many opportunities for parents to be well informed about the education and care of their children and take part in numerous centre events and activities.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme of education and care based on their observations of children’s emerging interests. This emergent curriculum is still developing. Teachers are exploring ways to more effectively notice children’s learning, and document their observations in individual children’s portfolios.</p><p>The environment is organised to allow children to have access to a wide range of equipment and resources for prolonged periods. This allows them to engage in uninterrupted play and maintain an interest over time.</p><p>Early literacy and mathematical concepts are integrated throughout the programme and there are many opportunities for children to explore their ideas about number and print. There is a planned approach for children as they transition to the local primary schools. A unique feature of the programme is the regular walks into the adjacent bush area to explore the natural environment and develop an interest in sustainable practices.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and families into the centre. Interactions observed by ERO between teachers and children were sensitive, appropriate and responsive to children’s needs and care. Teachers are increasingly using te reo Māori in meaningful contexts and planning the environment to reinforce aspects of tikanga Māori. Teachers respect children’s preferences as they chose to play alongside their peers, with adults, and independently.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the following aspects of centre operations are key next steps for review and development. There is a need to further develop:</p><ul>
<li>recently implemented processes for programme planning and evaluation based on the emergent curriculum</li>
<li>assessment practices so that teachers more clearly identify the learning that is occurring, possible next learning steps, and show the way children are progressing over time</li>
<li>the daily natural integration of te reo Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Children’s Garden Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Children’s Garden Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>28 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
