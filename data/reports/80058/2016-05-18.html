</table><p>This is because:</p><ul>
<li>teachers were not appraised in 2015</li>
<li>the centre manager has never been fully appraised</li>
<li>the centre had not developed strategic and annual planning as raised in the 2013 ERO report.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jade-Star Infants and Toddlers Centre is one of two privately owned centres on the same site. Children from three months to three years of age attend the centre. They move to the adjacent centre for older children, once ready. Children are cared for and learn in a family-oriented, home-like environment in line with the centre's philosophy. It is a small centre and most of the children are under two.</p><p>The centre manager oversees the two centres, managing their day-to-day operations and sharing professional leadership. The head teacher and other staff are qualified early childhood teachers. The staff work well together as a team with their thoughtful and committed approach to supporting children and their families.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made some progress in addressing key next steps in the 2013 ERO report. Self review and partnerships with parents to do with children's care and learning have significantly improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well cared for in a calm, settled and nurturing environment. Teachers encourage children to make choices about what to do and to be independent. ERO observed respectful relationships between children and their teachers. Children are given time to explore and extend their interests. Teachers do not hurry these experiences. They make good use of their interactions with the children to encourage their understanding and use of oral language.</p><p>Individual children's learning is well planned for. Parents' aspirations for their child's learning are regularly sought and acted on. Learning stories indicate a variety of learning experiences where teachers identify the strategies they will use to promote children's learning. Group learning programmes are responsive to children's interests. Teachers collaboratively plan, adapt and implement these programmes to enrich learning. Several programmes have focused on promoting healthy food and physical activity.</p><p>Children benefit from well-managed systems for their care and learning. Their routines are well established and managed with smooth changes as their day progresses. Their transitions to the adjacent young children's centre are very well planned and flexible. The staff know the children and their families very well. They are committed to improvement and ensuring positive outcomes for the children.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to hear and respond to te reo MƒÅori. Several staff have been developing their knowledge of MƒÅori language and culture through ongoing external professional development. Reviewing how well MƒÅori perspectives are integrated into the curriculum has been identified by staff as the focus for 2016.</p><p>Centre staff, led by the manager, have made very good use of professional learning to understand and carry out self review. The centre's philosophy has been comprehensively reviewed. Self review is prioritised in staff meetings, contributed to by all staff and well documented. This has resulted in improved teaching practices. It is now time to develop a schedule of planned reviews so that all key aspects of centre operations and provision for children are reviewed over time. Leaders need to ensure that all reviews are evaluative.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher lead a cohesive teaching team. They are intentionally building leadership within the centre. Staff members communicate effectively with each other and parents about priorities for children. They support and model good teaching and assessment practices. The teachers were not appraised in 2015. However, the centre manager has developed an improved appraisal procedure and framework for 2016.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager has not had formal appraisal during her tenure. The owner and centre manager must ensure that all staff have a robust and rigorous appraisal annually. In addition, personnel procedures should be reviewed and improved to reflect current best practice with respect to Provisionally Registered Teacher support and staff recruitment.</p><p>The centre has no strategic and annual planning to identify priorities and to guide its future development. This was specified in the 2013 ERO report. It is now a matter of high priority that this be developed. Areas such as staff professional development, appraisal, budgets and reporting should align with the strategic priorities.</p><p>The owner and licensee must ensure they are meeting their good employer obligations with respect to access to suitable staff training, development and collecting anonymous feedback from staff about their employment at the centre.</p><p>Aspects of assessment and planning for children's learning have improved since the previous review. Leaders must now ensure that these and evaluation of children's learning are consistently of high quality throughout the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Jade-Star Infants and Toddlers Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified non-compliance relating to appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>suitable human resource management practices are implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[GMA7, Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008].</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consults with the Ministry of Education and plans to address the key next steps and action outlined in this report.¬†</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jade-Star Infants and Toddlers Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>18 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
