</table><p>This service needs to strengthen governance and management. It also should develop sustainable systems and processes that improve teaching practice and learning experiences for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Stars Educare Wairoa is a privately owned centre, operating Monday to Thursday for eight hours a day. At the time of this review, 26 children are enrolled at the centre, including eight up to the age of two years. Of these, 85% of children identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre owner is a qualified teacher with full registration. She is also the manager. Two provisionally registered teachers work in the centre. Two unqualified staff support the teaching team.</p><p>The centre operates a mixed-age, bilingual programme. Its philosophy expresses a belief in children learning life skills and gaining confidence through meaningful relationships and whƒÅnau participation.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate enthusiastically in a child-centred, play-based programme. Routines provide them with a framework for the day and a sense of security. The home-like environment fosters their belonging.</p><p>Partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau are highly evident. Their knowledge is valued and they contribute significantly to children‚Äôs participation in the programme. Whanaungatanga and community engagement are central to the culture of the centre.</p><p>Children are immersed in a bilingual environment. Te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori are naturally woven throughout the day. Teachers acknowledge children‚Äôs place as part of a wider whƒÅnau and iwi. Their MƒÅori identity is cherished.</p><p>Children‚Äôs profiles show their participation in the programme, and at times they highlight their emerging interests. Teachers have identified a need to continue to strengthen these to show how children's learning is extended over time. ERO's evaluation agrees.</p><p>Staff know children and their families well. Qualified teachers work alongside children following their interests and extending their learning. However, teaching practice is not yet consistent across the staff team. Processes to support ongoing improvement in the provision of education and care require attention. The appraisal process is not sufficiently robust to improve teaching practice and requires further development. The programme of induction and mentoring for provisionally registered teachers should be strengthened.</p><p>Infants and toddlers freely access the environment. They have opportunities to learn from and interact with their older siblings and wider whƒÅnau. Unqualified staff need support to view young children as being competent and capable learners. The programme for children aged up to two should be strengthened to ensure their particular needs are met.</p><p>Self review is in the early stages of development. Teachers should continue to develop their understanding of the process of self review and their knowledge of evaluation. This should help them to monitor the effectiveness of centre operation and practice, and guide future decision making.</p><p>Although appropriate policies are in place, there is a lack of consistent implementation. The manager should continue to develop her understanding of how these policies guide centre operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers need support to strengthen governance and management and develop sustainable systems that improve teaching practice. These include:</p><ul>
<li>developing management understanding of guiding policies</li>
<li>developing human resource processes that build and support teachers' professional practice</li>
<li>enhancing assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthening self review</li>
<li>strengthening the programme for infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Stars Educare Wairoa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>take all reasonable steps to promote the good health and safety of children enrolled in the service, by gaining evidence of parental acknowledgement of medication administered to children.¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS28 (2)]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the manager has provided ERO with evidence that steps have been taken to address the action for non-compliance identified in the report.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Stars Educare Wairoa will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>12 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
