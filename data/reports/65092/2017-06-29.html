</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jeffrey Giraffe Early Learning Centre (ELC), previously reviewed as angelCare preSchool, is located in Christchurch. The current owners and the head teacher managed two angelCare services prior to restructure and renaming. The majority of teachers are also long-standing staff, in place since the previous ERO review.</p><p>Jeffrey Giraffe ELC is a re-branded, stand-alone service, established in 2015. The owner and head teacher form the centre management. They are preparing to initiate property alterations to restructure the centre environment.</p><p>Children attend the service aged from birth to five years. The environment has two separate areas organised according to children's age.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, there has been insufficient progress in addressing most key next steps outlined in that ERO report. Managers need to focus attention on setting goals that are more child-focused, and to implement and embed more deliberate leadership strategies to achieve these.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive, warm relationships in a highly settled, nurturing and peaceful environment. Teachers encourage children's curiosity, problem solving, and independence. Children are confident and supportive of each other in their play and exploration.</p><p>Children could benefit from having a greater range of resources that engage, challenge and extend their thinking, particularly in promoting and supporting literacy and number concepts.</p><p>Teachers know the children well, observing and responding spontaneously to emerging interests. Good communication between teachers ensures that children are safe and well supported as they move between the inside and exterior spaces.</p><p>Information about children's current strengths, interests and needs is shared well. Formal goals for children are set collaboratively as a result of termly assessments and teacher observations. Parents are invited to share their aspirations and comments about their children's wellbeing, learning and progress via an on-line portal.</p><p>A strong culture of whanaungatanga that is inclusive and celebrates diversity is highly evident. Children and families are warmly welcomed. Good quality professional development for teachers, and purposeful improvements in programme and practice honours a bicultural commitment.</p><p>Teachers nurture children's culture, language and identity using te reo Māori, participating in mihi whakatau and karakia, and modelling tikanga Māori. Cultural festivals and significant events are celebrated regularly. However, there is a lack of recognition of the diversity of children's culture, language and identity represented and celebrated in the environment.</p><p>Nurturing and responsive care giving supports infants and toddlers. They experience strong and secure attachments with familiar adults. Children are sensitively encouraged to gain mastery of their own physical development. Well planned spaces provide options for children's choice and free movement. Teachers provide a calm, unhurried programme that effectively adds to children's wellbeing.</p><p>Centre leaders seek feedback from staff and parents and are now in a position to extend leadership responsibilities across the team. Shared expectations and clear understanding of roles is likely to support effective, shared responsibility.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre management agree that the next steps to improve outcomes for children are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing shared understanding and consistency in planning and teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of resources and the environment in meeting children's learning, social and cultural needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening guiding documents and strategic planning, with more specific, measurable goals that place greater focus on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving leadership structures, systems, procedures and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre leader has identified an aspect of the performance management system that can be further strengthened.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jeffrey Giraffe Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jeffrey Giraffe Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/ (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>29 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
