</table><p>angelCare preSchool is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>angelCare preSchool is located in Christchurch, is one of two family-owned and operated preschools. The service’s philosophy and vision promotes positive, respectful relationships. Children aged from birth to five years of age learn and play in three welcoming and inclusive environments. They take safe risks and are encouraged to explore knowledge through their imaginative and creative play.</p><p>Centre staff support the Māori concept of ako where everyone is a learner and a teacher. A strong sense of whanaungatanga is reflected through the positive family-like relationships. The three learning spaces and shared outdoor spaces enable children to learn from each other and to be caring and supportive of those younger than themselves.</p><p>The centre managers and teachers have made progress in addressing the recommendations in the May 2010 ERO report. Resources are now regularly cleaned, and checks while children are sleeping are now recorded. Learning interests and achievements are now easier for children and parents to see and revisit. Self review has been strengthened with some useful reviews leading to improvements to the programme and environment.</p><p>There is a good mix of experienced and newly trained teaching staff. A new role for the centre director includes working alongside staff in the programme and providing professional leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from having a one-on-one relationship with a teacher they know well. This friendly and nurturing relationship positively impacts on children’s confidence and wellbeing. ERO observed children settling happily engaging well in play activities for long periods of time. They use their imaginations to create learning opportunities for themselves and readily draw on their personal learning experiences to enhance their play. Children would benefit from having a greater range of resources that challenge their thinking and extend on their learning.</p><p>Children and their parents are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children’s cultural backgrounds are valued and special events are celebrated with their families. They have good opportunities to develop an awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand through hearing te reo Māori and learning aspects of tikanga Māori. Children with special learning needs are well provided for and included in all aspects of the centre’s programme.</p><p>Teachers effectively use a range of positive practices to support children’s learning and wellbeing. The best practices ERO observed included teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regularly encouraging and giving feedback to children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>valuing and using children’s ideas and parent information to enhance programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using open-ended questions to extend children’s thinking and problem-solving skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively responding to children’s interests and needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work collaboratively and regularly share information about children’s learning and development with each other and with parents. The centre’s informative web-based programme provides parents with easy access to information about the centre’s operation and about their child’s learning.</p><p>The managers have good procedures to guide the centre’s operation. They use a well-developed process for providing teachers with feedback about their performance and to set goals for future development. The centre director is still to complete this process for all teachers.</p><p>The managers and teachers have a useful process for reviewing the quality of the service’s operations and programmes. The next step is to modify the process so that the planned and spontaneous reviews already underway can be more manageable.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers have identified that their next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers developing a shared understanding and consistent use of the centre’s expectations for planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the quality of resources, environment and routines in meeting children’s learning and social needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the centre’s strategic plan so that it outlines more specific and meaningful goals and measurable outcomes for children and staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of angelCare preSchool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO found a number of items that could be a risk to children in the event of an earthquake. These were also identified in the 2010 ERO review.</p><p>In order to address this, the service provider must:</p><p>1. ensure that the centre has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the premises facilities and other equipment on the premises are used safely and kept free from hazards.<em>[Education (Early Childhood) Regulations 2008 46(1)(c)]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of angelCare preSchool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>20 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
