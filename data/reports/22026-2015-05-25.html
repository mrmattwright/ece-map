</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Morningside Playcentre is a parent cooperative where learning programmes for children are implemented by the families who are centre members. Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. Very good training levels have been sustained over time. Currently, 18 members have Course 2 or 3 Playcentre qualifications including a number who will soon complete Course 4.</p><p>The centre provides four mixed-age sessions each week. It also offers an additional outdoor session for children over 3 years of age, where children play, explore and learn in a natural environment in the local community. An educator is employed to lead this session alongside parents/whƒÅnau.</p><p>High quality practices identified in ERO‚Äôs 2012 and 2008 reports remain evident. These include a culture of reflective practice, high quality management processes and purposeful self review. The support for, and documentation of children‚Äôs learning continues to be a feature of the centre‚Äôs programme. Since the previous review, members have worked together to further improve the environment and resources and enhance the ways they foster children‚Äôs complex play.</p><p>Morningside Playcentre is part of the Auckland Playcentres Association that provides Playcentre adult education, frameworks of policies and procedures and support from Association personnel. The Playcentre contributes to the make-up of the association and has representatives at¬†Association level.</p><p>At present the Playcentre Federation is undertaking a restructure with the aim of maintaining the viability of Playcentres throughout New Zealand. This is likely to change the current structure of the Auckland Playcentres Association.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine Playcentre reviews in the Auckland Playcentres Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playcentre philosophy of parents/whƒÅnau and children learning, playing and growing together is highly apparent. Respectful relationships provide a strong foundation for supporting children‚Äôs wellbeing. Infants and toddlers experience a calm, settled and well-resourced environment. They are encouraged to explore and play alongside older children. Adults know children‚Äôs individual preferences and use this information to plan specific learning experiences for this group of children.</p><p>Older children have frequent opportunities to play cooperatively with each other and to express their ideas and theories. They involve themselves in sustained and imaginative play for long periods of time. Children initiate and engage in complex play situations. They are independent, self-managing learners.</p><p>Adults work skilfully alongside children and extend their learning in meaningful ways. They value children‚Äôs knowledge and take time to listen to their ideas. Experienced centre members model high quality practices and support newer members to develop their understandings. As a result of these effective practices, children are very well supported to take the lead in their learning as designers, decision makers and investigators.</p><p>The learning programme is underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki, the</em> early childhood curriculum. Children clearly express their plans to extend their own learning. Adults are highly responsive to children‚Äôs thinking. They contribute their ideas and strengths to enrich children‚Äôs experiences.</p><p>Planning and evaluation processes are used effectively and contribute to programmes provided for individuals and groups of children. Records of group projects show how adults add to children‚Äôs collective learning and knowledge. Individual learning is documented in attractively presented portfolios that celebrate children‚Äôs progress over time. Portfolios provide very good information about children as they transition to school.</p><p>Adults are committed to strengthening the bicultural nature of the programme. A pepeha has been developed to share a story about Morningside Playcentre and its place in the local area. Parents/whƒÅnau plan to strengthen the integration of te reo me ona tikanga MƒÅori in the programme. They could also consider ways to increase the extent to which diverse cultures and language are visible in the environment and included in the programme.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Centre members work collaboratively to promote a high level of engagement and belief in the centre‚Äôs vision. They continue to be very involved in Playcentre adult education and ongoing professional development. Robust strategic and annual plans are reviewed annually and have a clear focus on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Strategic, planned and spontaneous self review contributes to a culture of continual improvement. Processes to support the privacy of children and families have been reviewed and agreed practices have been established. Centre members are committed to providing a safe physical environment for children and adults.</p><p>The Association‚Äôs strategic plan provides a guide for governance and is regularly monitored. Management and governance processes are well established. The Association provides assistance for centres and appropriate Playcentre training courses. It provides regular termly visits from a curriculum and programme supporter. Association office holders are highly committed to Playcentre philosophy and to maintaining Playcentre as a valuable early childhood education option for parents/whƒÅnau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing high quality practices centre members agree that they could:</p><ul>
<li>increase the inclusion of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori in the programme and environment</li>
<li>ensure that diverse cultures and languages are more visible in the environment and included in the programme</li>
<li>make greater use of Association policies to inform self review and centre practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Morningside Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Morningside Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
