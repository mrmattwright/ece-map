</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre is a non-profit, parent co-operative licensed to provide all day education and care for infants through to school age children. The centre’s vision and philosophy are clearly articulated and enacted throughout all aspects of the service’s operation. The centre is well resourced.</p><p>The positive findings in the March 2011 ERO report have been well sustained and the report recommendations comprehensively addressed. The new centre supervisor commenced her role in mid 2012. Staffing is stable.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive, respectful relationships with children and their whānau are given high priority within the centre. Communication with whānau is enhanced through the use of digital media and daily notice boards. These help whānau to know what has been happening for their children on a day-to-day basis. Teachers regularly receive pertinent and timely input from families which assists teachers with their programme implementation.</p><p>Children’s learning and wellbeing is effectively supported by centre staff. Teachers are aware of priority children and their particular needs, and provide sensitive support. Babies and toddlers are well nurtured in a calm, peaceful environment. Teachers are highly attuned to infants’ needs. They engage in responsive interactions and adapt to the rhythms of each individual.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the variety of ways children express and explore their growing understandings of the world, and use a range of strategies to further promote their learning. Educators build children’s confidence to explore and persevere with challenge. Children are offered choices and are encouraged to think of their own solutions to problems. Children have opportunities to revisit their prior learning and to choose and experience appropriate levels of challenge.</p><p>The principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi are incorporated into teacher practice. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are actively promoted with added support provided by Māori whānau who regularly meet together. Teachers actively seek and respond to whānau aspirations. Parents’ perspectives influence the design of the curriculum.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, teachers have worked collaboratively to strengthen their curriculum and self-review practice. Improvements made to assessment and planning practices and programme development link clearly to the service’s philosophy and the goals and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Centre leadership and targeted professional development have led to consistent practice and improved outcomes for children and their whānau. Collaborative self review and reflection is appropriately focused and effectively used to critically appraise centre practices and to identify and enact areas for improvement.</p><p>Centre leadership is strong and models effective practice. A consultative management style encourages staff to work to their strengths to bring about positive differences for children. The appraisal system is appropriately linked to the Registered Teacher Criteria and effectively informs professional development. Staff have collaboratively developed handbooks that are resources to ensure shared understandings of expectations and procedures for both parents and teachers.</p><p>Transition to school is supported through developing relationships with nearby schools. Children enthusiastically take part in a ‘school-time’ programme which has been the focus of a recent self review. Revisiting this review to focus further on the purpose and the nature of the programme activities would be an appropriate follow up.</p><p>Information and communication technologies are effectively used to communicate with parents and wider whānau and are instrumental in the high level of positive feedback received by staff. They provide opportunities for children to revisit their learning and extend their interests.</p><p>The parent committee supports good governance and positive management of the service. They are using an external facilitator to strengthen their strategic planning. Having transformed centre self review into a collaborative process with staff, the supervisor is helping committee members strengthen their understanding and participation for sustaining and improving service performance.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and staff should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>use self review for identifying and making improvements at Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre</li>
<li>implement self-identified steps to further strengthen partnership with Pacific families.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nga Tamariki Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>19 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
