</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Kidz Educare provides all day education and care for a maximum of 50 children, including up to 12 children under two years of age. Children are catered for in three age-related areas with opportunities throughout the day for all children to interact with other age groups. Meals are provided for children.</p><p>The centre's roll reflects its multicultural community, and this diversity is highly valued. Many children are from Chinese families. Teaching staff are carefully selected to reflect this cultural identity. Some staff are multilingual and this provides children with opportunities to converse in their home languages. The centre has some long-serving staff and well established associations with many families.</p><p>Teaching practices and education are guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The toddler and preschool rooms are also influenced by the Emilia Reggio philosophy. The centre philosophy has been recently reviewed. It focuses on the most important thing in the world being people, and embraces cultural diversity.</p><p>This centre is one of three privately owned services and is part of the Just Kidz Educare Trust. The centre has six registered teachers.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted how well the centre catered for children's cultural diversity. It also commended the quality of relationships and interactions between children and staff. These aspects are still strengths in the centre. The areas for development noted in the report included improving programme planning and assessment of children's learning, teacher performance appraisal and aligning self review with the centre's guiding documents. Good progress has been made in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families benefit from a centre environment that is welcoming and inclusive.Teachers value the information that parents share about their aspirations and children’s home experiences. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The children are happy and engaged in their learning. They have good opportunities to mix together and develop their social skills. They have access to all areas of play and are free to choose activities based on their interests and preferences. Both inside and outside learning areas are well designed and offer challenges and resources for children to explore.</p><p>The children experience close and trusting relationships with teachers. Teachers are respectful and aware of children’s learning needs and strengths. They work alongside children, supporting them in their play and exploration, and helping children to develop oral language. Attractive and well-presented wall displays reflect programme activities and what the children are learning.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from having a primary carer assigned to them. Teachers promote a calm and peaceful environment. Care routines are appropriately individualised. Toddlers and preschool learning areas are flexibly used. Children receive good quality care and appropriate learning opportunities. The preschool teachers continue to develop links with the neighbouring school, supporting children’s transition from the centre into school.</p><p>Catering for children with special learning needs and for those for whom English is an additional language is a significant feature of the centre. Teachers work with external agencies to provide specialist support for children.</p><p>Teachers include te reo Māori through greetings, waiata, stories and numeracy learning. They are deliberately working to increase the use of te reo Māori at group times and in their conversations with children.</p><p>Parents who spoke to ERO during the review appreciate the frequent opportunities that teachers provide for conversations about children’s progress and development. They value the interactive electronic portfolios showing their child’s learning journey. Hard copy of the portfolios are being reintroduced to enable children to access these during the day. Centre managers have identified the need to refine children's individual assessment and follow up each child's next steps for learning to more clearly show the progress that children make over time.</p><p>The centre manager values a collaborative working approach. Staff meet regularly to plan activities and resources that reflect children’s current interests. Teachers now need to deepen their evaluative thinking as they review their teaching and the learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The owners and centre managers review policies and procedures regularly. They should now prioritise the review of procedures to ensure they reflect current practice and legal requirements. To support teacher growth, managers recognise that they should review teacher appraisal processes, establish a process for supporting newly graduated teachers, and align leadership roles and responsibilities with job descriptions. Strategic and annual plans should be aligned and improved to provide a clearer guide for ongoing centre development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and the centre mangers agree the key next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>align the long-term strategic and annual plans to guide the future direction of the centre, in consultation with staff and whānau</li>
<li>develop and use indicators to evaluate how well the strategic goals are met</li>
<li>ensure that processes for teacher appraisal and the endorsement of teachers' practising certificates meet the requirements of the New Zealand Education Council.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Kidz Educare - Dannemora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Just Kidz Educare - Dannemora will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
