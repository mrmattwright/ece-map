</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ko tƒÅtou ngƒÅ kanohi ora o ngƒÅ awa, o ngƒÅ papa pounamu.</p><p>‚ÄòWe are the living eyes for the mountains, the rivers and the beautiful valleys. We must preserve our natural environment‚Äô</p><p>This whakatauaki represents the whƒÅnau commitment to education for sustainability, and initiatives that are successfully embedded throughout the programme. The kindergarten has been successfully meeting the requirements of the enviroschools silver award. Te Ao MƒÅori through NgƒÅ purakau MƒÅori is woven into caring for papatuanuku. Children, teachers, parents and whƒÅnau regularly go into the community to be part of the natural environment. They walk in the local reserve and parks, and undertake external visits as they strengthen their community of learners beyond the kindergarten boundary.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy aims to create a place where children and their families and whƒÅnau feel comfortable and where their culture is affirmed. Kindergarten staff value the uniqueness of each child acknowledging gender, culture, heritage, religion, family diversity, age and ability in creating a community of learning that benefits children. Children are affirmed as being capable, competent and successful learners. Parents‚Äô whƒÅnau and teachers work to provide opportunities where children can express their ideas and test their theories. Children are held in high regard and there is an emphasis on positivity, and a focus on building respect for each other and for the environment.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Region Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher MƒÅori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao MƒÅori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction for its kindergartens with an emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and communities, education for sustainability, meeting community need, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching, education and care provided by this kindergarten.</p><p>Welcome Bay Free Kindergarten provides sessions on Monday to Friday from 8.10am to 12.25pm and on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 1.10pm to 3.25pm for children from three years to school age. The roll of 56 children includes nine of MƒÅori descent.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A long standing, highly experienced and knowledgeable head teacher works collaboratively with her teaching team. Her engagement in ongoing professional learning informs her approach to coaching and mentoring teachers, and to providing educational leadership for the kindergarten. The teaching team, in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau, have developed a shared vision that fosters confidence, curiosity and innovation within this community of learners. Children benefit from teachers‚Äô shared leadership that contributes to an enjoyable, caring and harmonious culture.</p><p>The knowledgeable and experienced teaching team use self review effectively to make well-informed decisions about the curriculum, and children's learning. Since ERO‚Äôs last review in 2012 music, drama, oral language, information communication technologies and assessment practise have been strengthened through self review.</p><p>Teachers give priority to establishing highly responsive and respectful relationships at all levels of the kindergarten. These relationships are foundational to a curriculum that:</p><ul>
<li>values the strengths, interests, knowledge and expertise that children, their families, teachers and the wider community contribute to learning</li>
<li>reflects the language, culture and heritage of children, families and teachers, celebrating diversity and adding richness to children's learning</li>
<li>maximises the way expertise, talents and resources are used to enrich children's learning</li>
<li>is underpinned by highly effective collaboration between children, family, whƒÅnau and teachers</li>
<li>contributes to the strong sense of belonging and ownership to the kindergarten as a learning community.</li>
</ul><p>Education for sustainability principles and practices are embedded throughout the curriculum which embraces ngƒÅ mƒÅtapono of te ao MƒÅori. These concepts, values and ways of being are naturally integrated through teaching practises.</p><p>Assessment through the framework of <em>Te Rakau Akopai</em> effectively creates individual learning pathways for children. These processes engage teachers, parents and children in assessment and planning, and affirm children as capable and successful decision makers and learners.</p><p>Teachers have a deep knowledge of children. They are highly attuned and intentionally use a variety of teaching strategies and practises to co-construct meaningful learning experiences with children. Teachers share a philosophy and commitment to inclusive education that supports all children and families, and provides children with positive ways to think about celebrating differences.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten staff acknowledges the need to continue to work with local schools to foster continuity of learning for children.</p><p>An important consideration for the association is to consult with the kindergarten community and ensure the effective transition and management of the planned reorganisation to the sessional structure and staffing.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Welcome Bay Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Welcome Bay Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.
