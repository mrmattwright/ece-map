</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onepoto Playcentre is a well-established centre adjacent to a community reserve in Hillcrest, on Auckland‚Äôs North Shore. The centre provides an inclusive environment and attracts local families from its multicultural community. It offers five sessions each week and is licensed for 28 children from birth to five years old.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of parents and children playing and learning together. Parents take on roles and responsibilities that contribute to the running of the centre and offer opportunities for emergent leadership. Sessions are guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The centre is one of 21 in the North Shore Playcentre Association. The Association provides a management and policy framework, and centre support personnel. Playcentre Aotearoa is in the process of a national restructure and the North Shore Association is now part of Playcentre's northern region. A new regional manager has been appointed and support personnel roles and expectations are being confirmed.</p><p>Professional development from the Association and support from the field officer have helped centre members to respond to areas for development identified in ERO‚Äôs 2014 report. Assessment and evaluation processes have been strengthened, and te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are modelled confidently by several members. Many centre members are currently enrolled in Playcentre adult education programmes.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of six reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are capable, confident learners and have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They work with adults who actively support their interests. Children are encouraged to take responsibility, and to build on their existing knowledge. They access the wide range of resources that are available, and confidently make choices about their play. Children engage enthusiastically in creative and imaginative play for long periods.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau value and support child-led play. They have a good knowledge of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Connections to <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> are evident in planning, wall displays and children's portfolios. Daily evaluations help parents/whƒÅnau to recognise children‚Äôs interests and offer useful prompts to sustain continuity between sessions.</p><p>Centre members work cooperatively to support children's learning and are inclusive of each other‚Äôs cultures. Individual strengths and talents are recognised. A genuine feeling of care and community is fostered.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau take opportunities to offer prompts, and to facilitate and extend children‚Äôs learning. They are enthusiastic and actively involved with the children. Collaborating with children to determine the next step in their learning, and a greater focus on making learning more visible in planning and assessment would add to current good practices.</p><p>Parents/whƒÅnau have successfully worked on increasing their bicultural understanding, and their integration of te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori. Kotahitanga, ako and tuakana/teina relationships are evident throughout the centre, and manaakitanga is a strength. Centre members offer a supportive environment for new members to develop their skills. Visual prompts complement the resources offered by the Association. Children‚Äôs story books are used to build te reo vocabulary for both children and adults.</p><p>The Association management team has a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and having a bicultural partnership with whƒÅnau MƒÅori. This is evident in Association operations and in support provided to centres in the association.</p><p>Centre members are proactive and committed to the ongoing success of the centre. Internal evaluation focuses on improvement. An annual plan guides centre operations and supports sustainability. New parents are welcomed using a well-developed induction process. Centre members continue to offer high levels of training and support. A culture of feedback is ensuring that all members have a voice.</p><p>The Association currently has effective governance and management practices. A voluntary executive committee takes responsibility for specific management and centre support tasks. Good systems help them to monitor the quality of programmes, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements. The management team provides professional leadership to help centres respond to changes, particularly as they transition to the new national and regional structure.¬†</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>make the extension of the learning more visible in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation by increasing rigour, thinking evaluatively and focusing on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen current processes to transfer knowledge to new members, and to ensure the sustainability of the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onepoto Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onepoto Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
