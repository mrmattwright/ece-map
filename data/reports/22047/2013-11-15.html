</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onepoto Playcentre is a well-established centre that runs as a parent cooperative. The centre practices are based on playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre is open for four sessions per week and caters for children from birth to school age. Since the 2010 ERO report the centre has continued to foster emergent leadership, maintain effective management of the centre and improve the environment and programme for children. The playcentre operates as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><p>The association is the umbrella organisation for twenty one playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The association manages and distributes centres‚Äô funding and provides a training programme for parents/whƒÅnau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve playcentre reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a good quality programme that is underpinned by playcentre philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Centre members value and support child-initiated play and encourage children to make choices about what they do. They provide an interesting and well resourced learning environment that stimulates and sustains children‚Äôs engagement in play, learning and creative expression.</p><p>Respectful and friendly relationships between adults and children underpin the relaxed and welcoming tone of the centre. Centre members are highly supportive of each other in the parenting and education of their children. They ensure all ages of children can participate in a wide variety of learning experiences. Older children are well supported as they transition to school, and very young children have their individual needs met. Children play cooperatively, engage in group activities and demonstrate an enthusiasm for learning.</p><p>Centre members eagerly engage in playcentre adult training programmes. This training contributes to the sustainability of the centre. It supports the development of assessment and planning practices that are child focused and meaningful. Centre members use self review to reflect on and improve the programme and educator practice.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. Team members are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre. They actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association. Team members demonstrate the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise. The North Shore Playcentre Association provides effective support to help this playcentre remain well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>A bicultural partnership with MƒÅori whƒÅnau is evident in association operations. The management team has a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults‚Äô and children‚Äôs familiarity with te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Association management team are aware that aspects of self review could be more robust and better documented.</p><p>Centre members agree they could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>deepen the analysis and widen the scope of their self review</li>
<li>strengthen how well assessment portfolios show that individual children‚Äôs interests have been extended over time</li>
<li>increase the use of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori within the context of children‚Äôs play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onepoto Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onepoto Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
