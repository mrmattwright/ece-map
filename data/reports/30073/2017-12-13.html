</table><p>Well placed with an action plan.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori The School House is owned and operated by the BestStart education and care umbrella organisation. It is located in an historic house in the Hamilton suburb of Claudelands and is licensed for 40 children from two years old to school age. There are currently 43 children on the roll including eight MƒÅori. The centre offers both sessional hours and full-day services from 8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday to Friday.</p><p>Centre leaders, the manager and head teacher, are qualified Montessori teachers. They are supported by a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager from the BestStart organisation. Some teachers are participating in Montessori training. There are four teachers with early childhood qualifications and two support staff. BestStart provides effective governance for the service.</p><p>Children from diverse nationalities learn in two separate, age-based areas. The Bambini room caters for children from two to three years old and the Casa room for children from three to school age.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report there have been significant and ongoing changes to professional leadership, centre management and the teaching team. The 2015 report identified the need for improvements to the programme, assessment and planning, strategies to positively guide children's behaviour, implementing bicultural practices, enriching the outdoor environment and improving teaching interactions. Good progress has been made with children's assessment. Bicultural practices that value and respect MƒÅori culture are now evident. Many of the remaining areas continue to need strengthening and embedding. Professional leaders have developed an action plan to address these areas with the new teaching team.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy aims to provide a Montessori-inspired curriculum that promotes children's independence, underpinned by a profound respect for each child, their family and the teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are learning in a calm and well-ordered indoor environment. They access good quality, age-appropriate Montessori materials. Children learn about and celebrate the cultures of the world.</p><p>Older children enjoy making choices and interacting with equipment that challenges their thinking. They benefit from respectful interactions with teachers. They are learning self-management skills and some children demonstrate high levels of independence. Early concepts of literacy, mathematics, science, cultural and sensorial experiences are shared through a systematic and sequential process at the child's own pace. MƒÅori cultural values are evident through centre displays, respect for tikanga practices, equipment and materials and cultural celebrations such as Matariki.</p><p>A particular feature of the curriculum are the weekly walks for small groups of older children to a nearby, bush-filled gully. This has enriched the outdoor experiences for these children and resulted in close links with the local community involved in the maintenance and restoration project. One teacher has strong links to the history of this area and is supporting children and teachers to deepen their appreciation of Papatuanuku and the natural world.</p><p>Children's learning and development is well documented. Attractive individual portfolios, digital portfolios, centre displays and regular teacher summaries of learning are available. Parents share their aspirations for children's learning at formal meetings with teachers and through frequent informal conversations. A strength is the multicultural staff who are able to speak with some parents in their own languages.</p><p>Next steps for strengthening the programme are for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>find ways to further integrate the language, culture and identity of each child in assessment, planning and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review centre routines to better align with best practice indicators in early child and Montessori settings.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The newly established teaching team has formed professional and collegial relationships amongst BestStart leaders, parents and whƒÅnau and staff. They work positively with specialist agencies to respond to children with additional needs. Teachers are committed to ongoing professional learning and development to support the implementation of a Montessori-inspired curriculum. ERO observed some examples of good teaching practice. However, strategies to positively manage children's behaviour need to be consistently evident in all teacher interactions with children, particularly in the Bambini room.</p><p>The newly appointed centre manager is well supported by the PSM through a planned induction process. She is setting clear direction for the re-introduction of a Montessori curriculum and models respectful practice in her interactions with children.</p><p>BestStart leaders continue to provide ongoing support for the service. A particular challenge is sustaining continuity for children and families through the many changes of staff over a number of years. The service benefits from governance support that includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>up-to-date policies and frameworks to guide centre operations and meet regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comprehensive induction for new staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular visits, reporting and documented feedback from the PSM and business manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relevant and regular appraisal, professional learning, development and mentoring to build teacher capability within a Montessori context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular and targeted self review that leads to development and improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders recognise the need for ongoing improvement and have developed an action plan that aligns to the key next steps for improvement identified by ERO .</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified a number of areas that need to be implemented and embedded in order to fulfil the intent of the service philosophy and improve outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide a wider range of equipment and materials, readily accessible by children, particularly in the outdoor environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement teaching practices that promote quality outcomes for children and reflect Montessori philosophy and best practice in early childhood education.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori The School House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori The School House will be in three years. ERO will monitor progress in line with the action plan.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>13 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
