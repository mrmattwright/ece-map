</table><p>Montessori School house requires further development.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @ The School House is owned and operated by Kidicorp Limited. It is located in the Hamilton suburb of Claudelands and is licensed for 40 children aged from 2 to 6 years. There are currently 35 children on the roll, 6 of whom identify as MƒÅori. The centre offers sessional hours and full day services and is open from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The centre follows the Montessori philosophy of independence, self management and decision-making. Scaffolded learning is promoted and encouraged through a well-prepared indoor environment. The centre operates two classrooms ‚Äì the Bambini room is for children 2 to 3 years and the Pre-school room for children 3 to 6 years.</p><p>The centre has gone through a number of changes in the last year. A new centre manager has been appointed as well as a new Kidicorp professional services manager. The teaching and administration team is also predominantly new.</p><p>The children at the centre come from a diverse range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. A high number have English as a second language. The centre celebrates the children‚Äôs cultures by honouring events such as Diwali, Chinese New Year, Matariki, Easter, Christmas and the Muslim festival Eid.</p><p>All teaching staff are either qualified Montessori teachers or progressing through their Montessori training. Most teachers are registered early childhood teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children follow a programme that covers the defined areas of the Montessori curriculum including: practical life, sensorial (sensory development and refinement), language (literacy), culture (geography, botany, science, zoology etc) and mathematics. ERO observed some aspects of the Montessori approach to teaching and learning termed the ‚Äúprepared environment‚Äù in the centre. Materials and activities are set out in an orderly and sequential manner. Only one of each activity is available to promote turn taking and patience. Natural and real materials such as wood and glass are used and the environment is uncluttered and features displays of classical artwork and cultural artefacts.</p><p>Teachers are at the early stages of planning a programme that compliments and enriches the learning supported by Montessori activities and equipment. ERO observed some children demonstrating high levels of:</p><ul>
<li>independence and self management</li>
<li>literacy and numeracy knowledge</li>
<li>fine motor skills</li>
<li>concentration, resilience and sustained activity.</li>
</ul><p>Staff are currently reviewing centre routines (such as morning tea and mat times) so they are more in line with Montessori philosophy and best practice.</p><p>Children and parents are formally and warmly welcomed into the centre. ERO observed respectful relationships between teachers and children. Children were generally respectful to each other and worked within their individual working spaces. Some challenging behaviours were observed and these required closer supervision and the use of better positive guidance strategies.</p><p>Generally, teachers have a good working knowledge of Montessori equipment and how to prepare the inside environment to support sequential learning and development in literacy and numeracy. Teachers use the Kidicorp on-line portal 'Story Park' to share learning stories and survey parent aspirations. Transitions into the centre are well managed with a staged approach and transitions within the centre are flexible to suit each child‚Äôs needs.</p><p>The new centre manager is strongly supported in her role to build leadership capability within her new team. Her commitment to community involvement in children‚Äôs learning has had a positive impact on the programme. Some examples are the regular conservation excursions and involvement in the local tree-planting event. In collaboration with the professional services manager, the centre manager has revised the centre‚Äôs annual plans in order to address the areas for development identified through focused self review.</p><p>Good use is made of professional development learnt through attendance at a recent Montessori conference. This experience has supported positive team building within the centre.</p><p>The centre has a shared vision underpinned by the Montessori approach to teaching and learning. They have maintained a strong connection with Montessori Aotearoa New Zealand (MANZ). The centre benefits from the management structure of the Kidicorp organisation and their systems and policies. The new management team is working hard to embed new systems to ensure an improved quality service is provided for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified a number of areas for development that are likely to have a significant impact on outcomes for children. Centre management and ERO agree that it is now necessary for the centre to plan to support teachers to continue to improve in the following areas: There is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>plan and implement a rich Montessori-based programme that is responsive to the strengths and needs of every child</li>
<li>develop assessment processes that clearly identifies and extends children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>track and monitor children‚Äôs learning so that teaching moments can be extended through specifically using Montessori teaching processes</li>
<li>develop a greater repertoire of positive guidance strategies particularly for children portraying more challenging behaviours</li>
<li>implement Montessori teaching practices that encourages rich oral language interaction and development</li>
<li>develop an outdoor environment that encompasses and reflects a stronger emphasis on Montessori philosophy</li>
<li>develop and implement bicultural practices that further extends knowledge and understanding across the centre programme</li>
<li>more critically reflect on practice to promote professional discussions about quality teaching and learning based on Montessori philosophy and practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori @ The School House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ The School House will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey,</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern,</p><p>8 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
