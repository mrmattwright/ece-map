</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fetu Taiala is a full immersion Samoan education and care centre in Mangere, Auckland. The aoga is located in a newly established purpose built centre alongside four other Pacific centres. The management and staff have been involved in a one year relocation project. At the time of the ERO review the aoga had been operating at their new facility for two weeks.</p><p>The centre is licenced for 40 children including up to 8 aged under two years. It provides for three separate age groups, Fetu Ao (under two years), Fetu Pupula (two to three years) and Fetu Lele (three to five years).</p><p>The aoga‚Äôs philosophy is to provide a learning programme based on <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and the Tiala mo le Gagana Samoa Curriculum. The context of the programme promotes gagana Samoa and aganu'u Samoa and Christian values.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs 2012 report identified planning, assessment and evaluation processes and self review as areas for development and review. The centre has made good progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a responsive and child centred programme with a focus on developing children‚Äôs learning based on their interests. There is a strong focus on promoting the joy of learning for children.</p><p>The aoga provides an inclusive and supportive environment for children where they are respected and valued. They enjoy positive and respectful relationships and have a strong sense of belonging in the aoga. Children are encouraged to express ideas and opinions. Teachers are committed to embedding and building on effective practices to promote children‚Äôs learning and well-being.</p><p>Teachers model Samoan language well and children actively engage in pese, tauloto, ma le tatalo fa'a Samoa. Children converse in gagana Samoa and parents are encouraged to support first language development at home. Some children are adept at leading Samoan performing arts.</p><p>Children are keen to learn and willing to engage. They experience a variety of opportunities to learn through their play. Music is celebrated and integrated well into the programme for children. They have good access to a range of resources and the outdoor learning environment. Children enjoy the opportunity to participate in excursions that broaden their learning experiences. Children‚Äôs self-management, expression and spoken language are encouraged.</p><p>Children under two participate in mixed age play. They are encouraged to be active and to try new things to grow in their confidence. Management have been responsive to this and have implemented a plan to establish a separate under two outdoor play area so that younger children can engage more with one another and explore freely at their own pace.</p><p>Children's transition programme into school develops their literacy and numeracy well in the context of play. Successful transition to school has also been further supported by the centre's close relationship with local schools and ongoing opportunities for children to visit the local libraries and Samoan bilingual units.</p><p>Teachers‚Äô appraisal processes are established and promote reflective practices. Teachers and management are committed to improving outcomes for children and leadership for staff. Staff have participated in ongoing professional learning and have developed a collaborative and open culture of sharing ideas to support positive outcomes for all children. Management and staff have had opportunities to share their knowledge and practice at local and overseas conferences.</p><p>Self review is used well to support ongoing improvement and quality learning for children. Centre policies have been reviewed to reflect current practice. The aoga has developed a strategic plan to guide centre practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agreed on the following priorities for development:</p><p>To extend children‚Äôs learning opportunities, teachers could continue to</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the level of challenge and complexity in the programme by promoting opportunities to develop children‚Äôs thinking, creativity and expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focus on developing children's learning dispositions, especially for the under two programme</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To ensure ongoing improvements in centre practices teachers and managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation processes and strategic planning by including the use of indicators to measure progress.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fetu Taiala Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fetu Taiala Aoga Amata will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a></h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
