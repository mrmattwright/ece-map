</table><p>Peninsula Community Preschool Inc.¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peninsula Community Preschool, operating under an incorporated society constitution, is located in Strathmore, Wellington. It provides education and care for 30 children aged over two years. Children representing diverse ethnic groups make up the roll of 26.</p><p>A parent committee takes responsibility for the governance at this service. The preschool manager and head teacher together oversee the day-to-day running of the centre. All staff are long serving.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is based around five touchstones: a nature-based education; the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum; honouring te Tiriti o Waitangi; relationships to people and community; and a place-based and play-based education. The values of respect, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and empowerment underpin the emphasis on lifelong learning, active exploration and a sense of connectedness to family, whƒÅnau, community and nature.</p><p>The centre has a bronze award through Enviroschools. It is a member of the Motu Kairangi KƒÅhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report identified, as a priority, the need to further develop te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Significant progress in this area is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in the play-based programme reflective of the local context. The calm, unhurried learning environment promotes high levels of engagement. Warm, reciprocal relationships are evident between staff, whƒÅnau and children.</p><p>The valued learning outcomes described in the centre's philosophy are strongly evident in practice. Children are highly engaged and self-motivated. They are given the space and time to develop and test their ideas using a range of natural and open-ended resources.</p><p>Routine times are used well as teachable moments. Excursions into the local environment further extend learning opportunities. Environmental sustainability is effectively practised and children are actively involved in promoting this.</p><p>The centre has developed a sound planning framework. Group plans are child driven and form the basis of the programme. Purposeful learning experiences are planned in response to children‚Äôs interests. The teaching team effectively supports and extends children's learning.</p><p>Strong partnerships enable parents, whƒÅnau and teachers to set meaningful individual learning goals. Profile books consistently capture the learning that is taking place over time. They reflect the bicultural curriculum and recognise and celebrate each families' culture, language and identity. This strongly promotes the children‚Äôs sense of belonging.</p><p>Kaupapa MƒÅori concepts are strongly evident in the environment. Children are familiar with and participate in karakia and waiata. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori in learning conversations with children and in profile books. The cultural expertise of whƒÅnau is actively sought by teachers to enrich the curriculum.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the centre are sensitively managed. Prior to children moving on to school teachers develop, in consultation with the child, a comprehensive school book. This contains useful information about the child's social and emotional development and learning dispositions to enhance transition.</p><p>A useful appraisal system promotes teachers and leaders professional growth and development. Regular meetings and observations of their practice offer opportunities for them to reflect on goals, receive feedback and set next steps.</p><p>The centre has a sound framework to support internal evaluation. Regular, in-depth review leads to positive changes in processes and activities. Further developing clear indicators of success should better support leaders and teachers to evaluate the impact of changes made on outcomes for children.</p><p>A clear strategic plan guides the direction of the service. The parent committee works collaboratively with teachers and staff to progress the centre‚Äôs goals and objectives. Leaders show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that aspects of internal evaluation require strengthening. The service has the capacity to do this and maintain ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peninsula Community Preschool Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>5 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
