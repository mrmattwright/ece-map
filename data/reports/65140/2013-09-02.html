</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hira Rural Kindergarten is located in Wakapuaka, a semi rural area close to Nelson city. This service is operated by Nelson Kindergarten Association through an agreement with Hira Community Preschool Incorporated which owns and maintains the building.</p><p>Education and care for up to 30 children over the age of two years is provided at the kindergarten. Morning sessions are offered each day and three days a week there is the option of an extended six-hour day.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff and volunteers from the community. The kindergarten vision, emphasising the importance of nurturing partnerships, children and the natural world, is strongly evident in practice.</p><p>Sustainable practices are promoted throughout the programme. The kindergarten is a member of the enviroschools initiative and has achieved a bronze award. An active parent committee leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing and improvements to the kindergarten environment.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergartens and early childhood services reviews in the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families have a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. Partnership with parents and whƒÅnau is strong, positive and respectful. Parents spoken to by ERO indicated that teachers take time to genuinely listen to families‚Äô aspirations and work collaboratively to implement these. Through doing so, each child's uniqueness is acknowledged and celebrated. The wider community is well used to enhance learning opportunities for children and extend their understanding of the living world.</p><p>High quality teaching challenges and extends children's learning. Children are viewed as competent learners. They make choices and follow their interests in play, and work collaboratively with their peers. Tuakana teina relationships are actively promoted by teachers where they facilitate opportunities for children to share their expertise and tutor their peers. Mathematics, music and high quality language experiences are an integral part of the programme.</p><p>The learning environment offers challenge and a wide range of interesting experiences that invite children to investigate. Children have very good opportunities to be physically active in a spacious outdoor area. Teachers work alongside children encouraging them to think and solve problems. Self management and independent skills are promoted.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a high level of commitment to implementing a bicultural programme. Te reo MƒÅori is valued and used by both teachers and children and appropriate tikƒÅnga practices are implemented. A culturally responsive approach is being implemented to promote success for MƒÅori children as MƒÅori. Teachers have identified that exploring success for Pacific children in this context is a next step.</p><p>A range of effective processes assist children and their families to successfully transition into the kindergarten and onto school. A transition to school programme offered to older children should be strengthened through evaluation that informs future programmes and identifies the impact on learning.</p><p>Well-presented portfolios highlight children‚Äôs engagement, developing relationships and, at times, progress. Parents frequently contribute to their child‚Äôs portfolios.</p><p>Teachers engage in ongoing research. They are highly reflective practitioners and are committed to keeping up-to-date with professional learning and development. Spontaneous review has been used to reflect on aspects of the programme to inform ongoing improvements. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Teachers and the association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>The recently updated appraisal process is collaborative and provides clear guidance and support to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation. ERO‚Äôs evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are well supported to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>show through the assessment documentation how depth and complexity has been added to children‚Äôs learning to more consistently highlight their progress overtime</li>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hira Rural Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hira Rural Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
