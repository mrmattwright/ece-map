</table><p>Vintage Kids One Tree Hill¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Vintage Kids One Tree Hill is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 30 children, including 10 aged under two years. The service operates in a renovated bungalow in a residential neighbourhood. Children of all ages play together in this setting. They come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, and many children and their families speak more than one language.</p><p>The centre owner is an experienced early childhood operator and owns one other centre in Auckland. A head teacher provides leadership across both centres. At this centre a team leader works alongside three other qualified teachers. One more qualified teacher will be appointed to complete this team. The cultures of the families are reflected in the teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy is based on children developing their creativity through storytelling. The aim is for children to become creative, confident, curious, caring and communicative learners. Learning through play in a natural, home-like environment that inspires children's imagination is valued by leaders and teachers.</p><p>This is the service's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy is well established and very well enacted by leaders and teachers. Teachers and many parents spend time reading to their children at drop-off time. Older children settle into imaginative play, often in small groups. They are articulate, play well together and participate well in centre routines and rituals.</p><p>In this mixed-age setting, teachers are very well aware of the younger children and their needs and interests. Teachers spend good periods of time settling these children. Their interactions with all children are supportive and caring. Children are relaxed and engage well in the programme, easily accessing resources for their play.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to support children's learning and wellbeing. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>listening well and responding to children's ideas and conversations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modelling effective and creative language and vocabulary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>valuing children's home languages and including these in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting children to develop the skills they need to initiate and maintain friendships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a well-considered environment that offers elements of challenge and risk taking.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Myths and legends are included to bring te ao MƒÅori perspectives to the storytelling philosophy. The team leader has a very good knowledge of te reo MƒÅori and uses the language well in the programme throughout the day. This teacher has a role in leading a programme of professional learning and development for the rest of the team in te reo and tikanga MƒÅori.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO expressed their support for the philosophy of the service, which fosters home and centre links through storytelling. They appreciate how approachable the staff are and how well their children settled into the centre.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes based on their observations of children's interests and consider how they might link these to books, stories, music and waiata. Drama, science and the natural world feature strongly in investigations and conversations. There are numerous opportunities for children to be engaged in creative projects that support their developing confidence and communication skills.</p><p>Children's portfolios are individual and capture their learning. A deeper engagement with <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, could support teachers to further develop individual programme plans in partnership with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. Internal evaluation follows an established process. It is relevant and collaborative. The process of teacher appraisal is currently under review. Leaders could align teachers' appraisal goals more strongly to the strategic plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen programme planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a process for evaluating the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the risk management process for centre excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Vintage Kids One Tree Hill completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>22 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
