</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Glendowie, in the residential area of St Heliers, is licensed for 80 children, including 23 aged under two years. The centre was previously known as Acorn Early Learning Centre. It is led by a newly appointed manager and a new teaching team.</p><p>The centre's philosophy recognises each child as a unique learner and values partnerships with families. Teachers aim to provide an environment that fosters learning. <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, is acknowledged as a guiding document.</p><p>The centre's 2015 ERO report noted respectful teaching practices and a focus on building partnerships with parents to support children's learning. These practices have continued.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Evolve Education Group. Evolve provides an overarching governance and management framework and visiting personnel to support the operation of each centre. A recent re-branding of centres has occurred, with a view to building a greater sense of unity across the organisation. Initiatives that have been recently introduced are intended to improve staff stability in centres, promote effective internal evaluation and lift the quality of teaching practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Evolve Education group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, confident and friendly. They play independently or seek out friends and respond to the routines in the centre. Children are supported by adults who are eager to engage with them and foster their sense of belonging. Opportunities for sensory and messy play are well included in the curriculum.</p><p>Effective teaching practices that promote positive learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an environment for infants and toddlers that nurtures their oral language and literacy development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respectful care practices that foster independence and self-help skills, and create a warm inclusive culture in the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>outdoor environments that are spacious and offer opportunities for exploration, independent play and physical challenge for children of all ages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good support for children as they transition into and through the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are developing new systems for programme planning that focus on teachers' observations of children's interests. These processes need continued development to ensure each child experiences a rich curriculum.</p><p>Respect for biculturalism is evident. Teachers are building their knowledge and understanding of te ao MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori. They are using words and songs in te reo MƒÅori with the children.</p><p>Leaders have a clear vision and direction for the centre. They are committed to ongoing improvement. Relevant areas for development have been identified. It is timely to consider ways to develop and strengthen a collaborative and cohesive team culture.</p><p>The centre is effectively managed. Annual centre audits established by Evolve help to ensure legislative requirements are being met regarding policies, procedure and curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers engaging at a deeper level with <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em> to strengthen programme planning, bicultural practice and building partnerships with parents based on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme evaluation so that it reflects more clearly on children‚Äôs learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a shared understanding across the team of quality practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company‚Äôs vision, values, philosophy, goals and systems reflect the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing clear strategic goals to inform improvement focused annual plans at regional, area and centre levels, that include <em>Te WhƒÅriki 2017</em> and a strategy for supporting Pacific children and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing moderation and monitoring of the roles and responsibilities of personnel in positions of leadership, including centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing monitoring of appraisal practices to ensure effective implementation is lifting teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively levels of resourcing in centres supports children‚Äôs learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Glendowie completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Glendowie will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu‚Äôuga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
