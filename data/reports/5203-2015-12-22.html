</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti is licensed to provide education and care for 40 children aged 2 years and over. There are currently 37 children enrolled in the Kindergarten, 20 of whom are MƒÅori. Most whakapapa to NgƒÅti Maniapoto.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed, and well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust‚Äôs strategic direction sets out the service‚Äôs vision, expected educational outcomes and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust‚Äôs professional leaders monitor the kindergarten‚Äôs compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities for professional development to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review there have been some changes in staff. Good progress has been made in addressing areas for review and development identified in the 2012 ERO report in the areas of assessment, planning, evaluation and bicultural approaches to teaching and learning. Staff have been involved in self-review of playground redevelopment, determining the aspirations of whƒÅnau and promotion of greater critical inquiry and self-reflection.</p><p>The kindergarten‚Äôs philosophy emphasises promotion of independence and supporting children to become competent and confident learners. This philosophy is strongly reflected in the kindergarten‚Äôs learning programme and environment, which is characterised by caring respectful relationships and a rich range of learning opportunities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children were observed to be confident, active and engaged in their learning and play. They are able to make choices about their learning and are able to sustain involvement in a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>The learning environment both inside and outside is safe, very well resourced and attractively presented to support children‚Äôs learning. Particular features of the environment include</p><ul>
<li>the integration of literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>opportunities for challenge in the outside area both in a physical sense and in terms of scope for exploration and experimentation</li>
<li>a focus on the natural world</li>
<li>promotion of ‚Äòhands on‚Äô creative activities.</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are strongly reflected in the environment and in the learning programme. Staff use te reo MƒÅori in their interactions with children. MƒÅori parents indicated that they felt at home in the kindergarten. There is an inclusive atmosphere and children from a variety of backgrounds and with diverse needs are acknowledged and affirmed.</p><p>The environment and programme strongly support and promote engagement and sharing of information about children‚Äôs learning with parents and whƒÅnau. This includes newsletters, children‚Äôs profiles, online information about children‚Äôs learning and the opportunity for daily conversations between parents and teachers. Children are well supported in their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are experienced and knowledgeable. They are caring and affirming of children, and are responsive to their interests and preferences. Teachers are finding ways to support children to lead and manage their own learning. There has been ongoing development of the assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning. Portfolios provide well-presented and accessible records of children‚Äôs learning and development. Recorded observations are focused on individual children.</p><p>Teachers participate in ongoing professional development and are being supported to be increasingly reflective about their practice. They are currently working with professional leaders to strengthen self review. This includes extending the range of strategies that enable them to respond appropriately to children in order to enhance their social competence. The kindergarten, with the support of the professional leader, is in the process of reviewing appraisal procedures to ensure that teachers are able to monitor and review their practice over time.</p><p>The head teacher is highly experienced and has a strong focus on improving outcomes for children. She continues to model warm and welcoming interactions with parents and whƒÅnau and provides strong links with the local community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten management agree that a key next step for the service is that of further developing the quality of self review as a means of building team and teacher capability, particularly in the areas of:</p><ul>
<li>responding to children‚Äôs culture and identity</li>
<li>exploring ways to deepen learning conversations to extend children‚Äôs learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
