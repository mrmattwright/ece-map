</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Finlayson Park Childcare Centre in Manurewa, provides full-day care and education programmes for up to 24 children aged three months to five years. There are strong links between the centre and the adjacent primary school.</p><p>Infants are cared for in a separate play space. They have good access to the indoor space of the older children and the shared outdoor environment. The majority of children enrolled have MƒÅori or Pacific Island heritage.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy, developed in consultation with the community and staff, provides a good foundation for the programme. Teachers are very focused on fostering education outside of the centre environment through frequent walks and outings. A team of qualified teachers, supported by two who are unqualified, provide a high teacher-to-child ratio.</p><p>In response to ERO‚Äôs 2012 review the centre has strengthened processes of self review and developed programme planning to be more responsive to individual children. Managers have provided frequent opportunities for the teaching team to engage in professional development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging in the centre. They play well together and have established relationships with each other and their teachers. They are encouraged to be independent and to take responsibility for caring for their environment and each other.</p><p>Regular walks to the library, parks recreation centre and school have strongly supported children‚Äôs developing confidence and knowledge of the wider world. Children are articulate, can initiate conversations, theorise and ask highly complex questions. A consideration for the teaching team is how these questions could be more fully incorporated into planning decisions.</p><p>The infant and toddler room has a slower pace and routines are very responsive to children‚Äôs needs. Teachers are responsive to verbal and non-verbal attempts at communication from the children in this area. Children have good access to available resources and the environment is set in response to their interests.</p><p>Teachers are very receptive to children‚Äôs requests and questions. Their practices reflect the rights of all children to an inclusive and quality early childhood education. They talk with children about decisions that affect them and sensitively manage transitions into, through the centre, and on to school. These practices have supported children‚Äôs developing sense of themselves of successful learners.</p><p>Established relationships exist between whƒÅnau, teachers and children. Aspirations of parents for their children are sought through informal discussion and regular whƒÅnau conferences. Children‚Äôs portfolios contain numerous and regular responses to learning stories contributed by families. The team is now reflecting on how they could more effectively respond to and include parent and whƒÅnau aspirations in programme planning processes.</p><p>There is clear evidence that centre practices align with the philosophy statement. A strong commitment to establishing successful, reciprocal relationships with whƒÅnau and the local community is evident. The centre philosophy statement could be reviewed now to include reference to the bi-cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The value of self-review is gaining more recognition by the team and there is a strong commitment to teaching and learning that leads to positive outcomes for children. Managers are aware of the need to more clearly, and more regularly, document self review projects that guide centre direction. Good access to professional learning and development is provided for teachers. Managers are able to articulate how these opportunities have strengthened teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre management team agree that key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>the continued development of teaching strategies and resources that support children to become confident in Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage</li>
<li>the development of a regular appraisal system for all teachers, that includes links to the Registered Teacher Criteria, and supports leadership development within the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Finlayson Park Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. The service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>establish systems and regular, well documented review, to ensure that all legal obligations are met¬†<em>Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Finlayson Park Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
