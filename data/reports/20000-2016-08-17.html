</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Acorn Montessori Children's House is a privately owned centre that offers Montessori-based education and care on both a full-day and sessional basis. It caters for children between the ages of two-and-a half and six years of age. The centre is licensed for up to 35 children.</p><p>The owner/manager prefers to offer placements for smaller numbers of children and to provide higher ratios of staff‑to‑children than are required by regulations. The head teacher and three other staff are registered teachers. Several teachers are able to support children who speak languages other than English.</p><p>The centre uses a Montessori model that is strongly based on fostering positive relationships with parents, children and teachers. The principles and goals of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> early childhood curriculum, are becoming more evident in centre planning and assessment practices.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report, the centre has been purchased by new owners and staffing has also undergone changes. The new owners have made good use of ERO's 2013 report to plan for centre development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience calm and settled learning environment. They demonstrate a clear sense of belonging in the centre. They welcome each other and talking amongst themselves and with adults who belong to or visit the centre. Teachers prioritise ongoing relationships as key to children's all-round growth and development as young learners. Children show high levels of social competence and capably express their ideas and wonderings.</p><p>Children are self-managing, collaborative and independent decision-makers and negotiators. They display creative, imaginative and critical thinking skills and abilities. The Montessori learning environment encourages the development of early literacy, mathematics, science, geography, and a broad range of skills and knowledge. Children have many options to choose from.</p><p>The indoor environment provides a broad range of equipment, activities and learning experiences that are readily accessible to children. These good features create opportunities for children to explore and to further develop their thinking and oral language skills. Children are respectful of one another and the learning environment, and capably lead their own learning. Currently the owner/manager and staff are reviewing the outdoor area with a view to expanding learning options for children.</p><p>Teachers quietly observe and work alongside children. They are available to support children's enquiries or to listen to their discoveries if children request their input. Their role is based around knowing children's interests and providing a well-resourced learning environment to extend those interests. Children have uninterrupted time to explore and learn at their own pace. Teachers work to support and extend children's learning, providing more challenging equipment to stimulate thinking or encourage skill and knowledge development, as appropriate.</p><p>Parents interviewed by ERO are positive about the centre and notice that their children are naturally transferring new learnings from the centre into their home situations. Children's progress is tracked against high quality indicators for holistic development and learning as detailed in <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>Processes to help children transition into the centre are well established and work well. Work has now begun on making connections with local schools and on developing strategies to support children's transition into junior school classes.</p><p>Building effective self-review practices in the centre has been a professional development focus. Initially the new owner worked with an external advisor to undertake a comprehensive review focused on the centre's vision, values and philosophy. They also considered how strategic planning could be used to bring about positive changes in all areas of centre operations.</p><p>It became evident, however, that all staff needed to have a shared understanding about self-review processes so that they could participate fully in bringing about positive changes and better learning outcomes for children. As a result, a good start has been made in using self review to develop the leadership capability of all staff. Leadership roles and support systems are being refined. Teachers are now taking opportunities to lead self-review projects that aim to increase the quality of learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Identified themes for improvement are based around:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to grow leadership capability among staff and deepening critical reflection to drive centre improvements</li>
<li>enhancing curriculum design and promoting responsive relationships between teachers and parents to create strong partnerships for supporting children's learning</li>
<li>enhancing teaching strategies to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop bicultural practices in the centre</li>
<li>create smooth and effective processes to support children's transition to school</li>
<li>work together to develop clear understandings of the value of in-depth reflective evaluation for identifying centre strengths and areas where improvements could be made to further enrich learning experiences and outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Acorn Montessori Children's House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Acorn Montessori Children's House will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
