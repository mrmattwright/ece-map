</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Andy's Educare is licensed to provide education and care for up to 25 children between two and five years of age. Until June 2015 the service was run as Lollipops Educare Royal Oak. The centre is privately owned and located in a renovated family home. Planned extensions will enable the service to cater for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The centre staff reflect the ethnic diversity of its community. There are three qualified teachers and one teacher in training. All teachers are new to the centre since the 2013 ERO review.</p><p>The centre’s vision and philosophy are aligned to <em>Te</em> <em>Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and were developed by the current staff to guide their practice. It is a bicultural document that promotes the celebration of cultural diversity in an inclusive setting. The philosophy prioritises a nurturing environment and strong relationships between children, whānau and centre staff.</p><p>Many of the positive features identified in the 2013 ERO report remain evident in the centre. These include respectful relationships, children's leadership of their learning and opportunities for parents to be involved in self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand is celebrated and promoted well throughout the centre, and clearly reflects the centre's philosophy. Strong bicultural practices underpin the programme. Children confidently respond to teachers' spontaneous and frequent use of te reo Māori. Tikanga Māori is reflected in centre routines. For example, children choose appropriate karakia for meal and mat-times. The importance given to biculturalism lays a solid foundation for Māori children to succeed as Māori and for other children to have their cultural identity affirmed and celebrated.</p><p>Children and their whānau are greeted and made to feel welcome in the centre. The environment depicts Aotearoa New Zealand and has been designed to create a sense of belonging and whanaungatanga for all children and their whānau. Good use of photographs and children's work also supports children's sense of belonging. Learning spaces are well resourced and children are free to move in and out of doors as they choose.</p><p>Teachers see their role as allowing learning to grow. They recognise children's developing dispositions and support them to flourish as they build their skills. Teachers encourage children to develop their leadership and social skills. They have a strong focus on growing children’s oral language skills by engaging them in complex conversations and group discussions.</p><p>Children participate in a curriculum where they have many opportunities to lead their own learning. Teachers work with children to support their interests and to develop each child's different capabilities. Children with special needs receive nurturing care and good support from teachers. Children develop different ways to be creative and expressive and use their home languages with each other and staff in play. The programme provides them with good early literacy and numeracy learning opportunities in the context of their play. Teachers are aware that they could incorporate more incidental opportunities for children to experiment with writing and mathematics.</p><p>Children are capable, self managing and independent. They benefit from engaging in tuakana/teina roles that foster their social and communication skills in groups and with each other.</p><p>Teachers use a variety of ways to identify whānau aspirations and interests. This information is used to inform planning and individual learning plans for each child. Portfolios record parents' and children’s contributions including good accounts of individual's dispositions and learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers support new families to transition smoothly into the centre, and take care to respect children's home languages in centre documents. They respect cultural preferences as they share information with parents about the value of children's play and the development of self-management skills.</p><p>Teachers are keen continue to build their capability in planning, assessment, and evaluation by undertaking professional learning and development. They are committed to building a more evaluative culture of reflection on their practice, and are keen to consider how they can grow their practice to keep current with changing requirements and new thinking.</p><p>Management systems are in the early stages of development as teachers develop systems specific to this centre. Staff work cohesively to ensure that there is ongoing self review and that systems are implemented effectively to ensure that children are well cared for.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to build management capability. Programmes for children need to be more strongly underpinned by management processes that reflect the good quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre owner agrees that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a more robust appraisal process for teachers that includes <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, and is clearly aligned to the <em>Practising Teachers Criteria</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek professional advice to improve strategic planning and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to improve internal evaluation to guide all aspects of centre operations and results in positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Andy's Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Andy's Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
