</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz World Rutland St is located in central Rotorua. It is an all-day centre catering for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for up to 72 children, including 16 aged under two years. Centre organisation comprises separate areas for children up to the age of two years (Discoverers) and for those two years and above (Adventurers). The centre is staffed with mostly qualified early childhood teachers and maintains high teacher-to-child ratios. It is privately owned and is one of three Kidz World centres in Rotorua. The Kidz World leadership team includes, the director, education manager, administrator and all three centre managers. This team works collaboratively to provide policy and direction, and promotes consistent approaches and professional sharing across all centres.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims for children to learn through play and exploration, be empowered to take risks for extending learning and encouraged to take responsibility for themselves becoming capable, competent and confident learners.</p><p>Since ERO's last report in October 2014 a new centre manager has been appointed and the centre vision, mission and philosophy have been reviewed. The centre has also undertaken a strategic review of age-based organisation, resulting in a more family-like setting and interactions for toddlers and older children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Respectful and reciprocal relationships between children, whƒÅnau and teachers are well established. These relationships contribute to responsive and positive transitions for children and their families as they enrol and progress through the centre and onto school. Parents value regular opportunities to share information, be involved in programme events and whƒÅnau evenings. Children demonstrate trust in their teachers who know them and their families well.</p><p>Highly-effective self review contributes to improved outcomes for all children. Self review is well developed and embedded at all levels. There is a shared focus on continual improvement to the curriculum, learning environments and teachers‚Äô practice. Children benefit from well-informed governance and leadership decisions that put them first and foremost.</p><p>The service‚Äôs strategic priority for excellent teaching practice is highly evident. Aligned to this priority is the position of a full-time coach and mentor who works consistently alongside teachers. The teacher appraisal process has continued to evolve. This includes teacher inquiries that contribute to shared understandings and reflections about quality practice. There is an organisational culture of professional sharing and growth that is underpinned by current educational theory. This intentional approach to building teachers‚Äô capability contributes to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy is pivotal to curriculum design and implementation. Features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>availability and rich resourcing of all areas of play, including literacy and mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an emphasis on developing social skills and confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical challenge and safe risk taking within spacious environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for tuakana, teina relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The curriculum supports children as active and capable learners.</p><p>Teachers express a commitment to strengthening their knowledge of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori. Children enjoy participation in waiata, karakia and cultural events. Aspects of the curriculum reflect connections with whƒÅnau and local stories. MƒÅori children and whƒÅnau are affirmed, and their language and culture are valued.</p><p>Assessment information is well used to inform intentional teaching. Observations of children are ongoing and regularly shared with parents. The recently introduced digital messaging system has increased information sharing and opportunities for parents to contribute to their child‚Äôs assessment. Learning journeys summarise individual children‚Äôs learning dispositions, strengths and interests over time, and reflect children‚Äôs home languages.</p><p>Effective teaching practices are well established. Teachers use a wide range of strategies to engage and support children in their learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the conditions created for children to lead their learning, and where fun and enjoyment are part of the learning process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting oral language acquisition and confidence to question and express ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flexible and responsive routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a culture of respectful care for children up to two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inclusive practices that promote equitable opportunities for children with additional learning needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children are happy, independent learners who demonstrate a strong sense of self confidence and belonging.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management and leaders acknowledge the need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to seek ways to support the ongoing development of treaty-based practices and the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine and embed the assessment, planning and evaluation of children‚Äôs learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz World Rutland St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz World Rutland St will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>14 May 2018</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
