</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raumanga Kindergarten in Whangarei provides four and six hour sessions for 40 children between two and six years of age. Approximately 90 percent of the children enrolled identify as Māori. The kindergarten’s philosophy has a strong emphasis on whanaungatanga and family participation. A team of four qualified teachers works very effectively to ensure the programme reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Positive aspects identified in ERO’s 2009 and 2012 reports have been sustained over time. Partnerships with families, bicultural practices, a well-resourced learning environment and high quality teaching practices remain features of the centre. Since 2012, teachers have continued to improve programme planning and assessment systems and use robust self review to enhance learning outcomes for children. They are currently involved in a professional learning project to research how they can promote children’s leadership through the development of oral language.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides governance, leadership and policy frameworks to meet operational management expectations. Association personnel assist teachers to maintain good standards of health, safety and to improve the quality of educational programmes. The Associations’ <em>Pūmanawatanga</em> Plan reflects a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and support for the development of bicultural practices across the organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident investigators who enthusiastically share their knowledge, ideas and theories about the world with teachers and other children. They show initiative, ask questions and are actively involved in conversations about their own learning. Children respond very well to teachers’ expectations of them as capable and confident learners. They take on leadership roles and imaginatively identify solutions and solve problems.</p><p>Flexible routines support children’s sustained, focused engagement in complex learning situations. Māori children experience an environment where te reo me ōna tikanga Māori is an authentic part of the programme. They are increasingly hearing the language of their heritage valued and celebrated at the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome and form positive relationships with children and their families. They work alongside children and are responsive to their ideas. Teachers listen carefully to children. They provide resources and use rich language to support and extend learning. Teachers make links to children’s home experiences and have extensive knowledge of their interests and strengths. Teachers continue to develop their bicultural practices to promote success for Māori children.</p><p>Positive relationships support children to settle confidently into the programme. Partnerships with families are a feature of the kindergarten. Information shared by parents is appreciated and used by teachers to build relationships with individual children. Teachers value and respond to the goals that parents have for their children’s learning. Families’ contributions to the programme are encouraged and appreciated.</p><p>The curriculum effectively promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers use high quality systems to assess, plan for and evaluate children’s learning. Children’s strengths, interests and engagement in the programme are clearly shown in attractive learning records. These individual portfolios celebrate the language, culture and identity of children and their families. Teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens during play and the progress children make over time. They work together to respond to and enrich children’s individual and group experiences at the kindergarten.</p><p>The head teacher is an experienced leader. There is a team culture of professionalism and high expectations in all aspects of kindergarten operations. Useful long-term goals, robust self review, research and an effective teacher appraisal system enable teachers to make positive changes that enhance teaching practices and children’s experiences at the centre. Association personnel have also supported teachers to build their understanding of skilful ways to foster children’s language development.</p><p>The Northland Kindergarten Association provides effective governance for kindergartens. Its long-term direction focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>good support and guidance from Association personnel to improve the quality of kindergarten programmes and teaching practice; particularly the development of bicultural practices and integration of <em>Te Ao Māori</em> (the Māori world) into programmes in meaningful ways for children</li>
<li>effective teacher appraisal and professional learning and development that contributes to improved teacher skills, knowledge and practice, especially in supporting children’s social competence and strengthening the quality of assessment documentation</li>
<li>significant investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children’s exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a focus on distributed leadership practices amongst kindergarten teaching teams to utilise teacher’s individual and collective strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Association leaders are considering ways to enhance teacher appraisal processes and systems for self review. ERO recommends that the Association strengthens systems to ensure that all health and safety requirements are being implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing high quality practices in Raumanga Kindergarten teachers have identified that they could:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review by improving the depth of their evaluation</li>
<li>continue to build connections with the local community to enhance the programme for children</li>
<li>work more closely with local schools to review how well children are supported to transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raumanga Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Raumanga Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>10 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> E</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">RO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
