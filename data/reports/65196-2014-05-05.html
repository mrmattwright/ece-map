</table><p>The Children‚Äôs House Hokitika is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children‚Äôs House is a small privately owned, Montessori early childhood centre, operating in Hokitika. Children aged two to six years of age attend from a wide geographical area.</p><p>A welcoming environment, with a wide range of specialist indoor and outdoor equipment, provides for the all round wellbeing of the child. The natural outdoor environment has many outdoor activities for children to develop an awareness of sustainable practices.</p><p>The new manager has a strong commitment to the Montessori philosophy. She is very well supported by the head teacher.</p><p>Parents are welcome to remain at the centre to help their children settle and to read or play together.</p><p>Most of the recommendations and actions identified in the October 2010 ERO report have been addressed. This report identifies that appraisal and induction have not been strengthened.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Montessori-focused curriculum is planned to stimulate children‚Äôs interests, curiosity and creativity. The philosophy is clearly evident in the programme. The well-prepared learning environment strongly reflects the Montessori teaching and learning approaches.</p><p>Teachers know the children well. Children are encouraged to explore and work through solutions to problems. The responsive programme provides a good balance between structured activities and free-choice. Programmes are extended through visiting specialists and trips to the local area.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to make decisions about the nature and direction of their play. They are encouraged to contribute to the way the programme is run. For example, children regularly help to make lunches and tidy up.</p><p>The mixed-age setting allows older children to regularly share their developing skills and knowledge with younger children. Children are appropriately challenged to explore the natural learning environment.</p><p>Relationships between children, teachers and families are respectful and affirming. A good level of communication between teachers, parents and children is evident.</p><p>The manager is developing better transition procedures between the centre and local schools. This includes preschool visits with parents and children with useful monitoring by teachers before children start school.</p><p>New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage is integrated into the programme and environment. As a result, children experience aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori naturally throughout their day.</p><p>The manager, head teacher and staff have been involved in a range of professional development opportunities that has resulted in improved use of teacher knowledge and skills.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager has identified and ERO agrees that:</p><p>the review of the centres philosophy should evaluate how well the Montessori philosophy and <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood <em>C</em>urriculum are integrated</p><ul>
<li>further development of strategic planning and self-review practices is a priority</li>
<li>the framework for self review now needs to continue to be refined and processes developed further.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that the manager now needs to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen self-review practices in order to focus more effectively on learning progress, next steps and outcomes for children</li>
<li>continue to develop clearer guidelines for the services operation</li>
<li>develop better guidelines for planning and assessment</li>
<li>formalise induction for all staff</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>During the review ERO identified two areas of non-compliance.</p><ol>
<li>¬†All teaching staff need to be appraised against the Registered Teacher Criteria and attestation<em>S77C State Sector Act 1998 (NZ Gazette No 180: Dec 1996)</em></li>
<li>¬†Whenever children leave the premises on an outing or excursion, assessment and management of risk is undertaken.<em>Source: Criterion HS17 of the Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; Regulation 46(1)(a) and 46(1)(b) Education (ECS) Regulations 2008</em></li>
</ol><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Children's House Hokitika completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Children's House Hokitika will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.
