</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Rongotai provides education and care for children from two to five years of age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, two of the children enrolled identified as Māori. Families and teachers represent a range of ethnicities. </p><p>Since the October 2015 ERO evaluation, a new teaching team has been established. All teachers are Montessori qualified or fully qualified in early childhood education. Day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the centre manager who also supports the teaching team.</p><p>Montessori Rongotai is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early learning services across New Zealand. They provide opportunities for teachers to participate in a range of professional learning and development activities.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: curriculum design; assessment; self-review processes; and understanding of Māori success as Māori.</p><p>The centre received targeted support through a Ministry of Education (MoE) funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Montessori Rongotai developed a plan to address the key areas of practice requiring improvement. The MoE has monitored the service since that time. Steady progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy and vision have been recently redeveloped with extensive input from family and whānau. Identified values are clearly evident in practice. Children are learning to explore and become more independent through a curriculum that is responsive, supportive and challenging.</p><p>Children experience warm and respectful relationships. Teachers know children well, working alongside them to effectively extend their learning and nurture social skills, resilience and persistence. </p><p>The principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the Montessori philosophy clearly underpin teaching and learning practice. Literacy, mathematics and science are woven through the programme. Teachers are well supported by leaders to plan and implement a curriculum responsive to children's emerging skills, interests and needs. There is a well-considered approach to supporting children with additional learning needs. External agencies are accessed when required.</p><p>Leaders are focused on improving the quality of education and care for all children. The centre manager has established a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Clear expectations for assessment, aligned to the service’s strategic plan, guide teacher practice. Improved systems and processes support teachers to better document learning and successfully notice, recognise and respond to the strengths and interests of children. A next step is for leaders and teachers to measure and evaluate the impact of their decision making and practices on children's learning.</p><p>Information about children’s growing capabilities is recorded through learning stories, as the centre's assessment tool. Teachers encourage parents and families to share aspirations for their child. Through their positive and thoughtful responses, parents are enabled to be part of their child's learning, successfully fostering partnership between home and the centre.</p><p>Te ao Māori is identified as a valued part of learning experiences and aspects are promoted throughout the programme. Children have opportunities to celebrate their identity and whakapapa through pepeha. A next step is to strengthen the bicultural programme through more consistent use of te reo Māori by teachers.</p><p>Cultural diversity is embraced and celebrated. Elements of Māori, Pacific and other cultures are incorporated well in the environment and programme. Leaders and teachers continue to develop their understanding of educational success for Māori and Pacific children. </p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into and through the centre. Successful transitions to school are supported by well-established relationships with local schools.</p><p>The professional service manager and business manager provide good guidance about the curriculum in action that clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy and procedural framework effectively guides the operation of the centre.</p><p>A clear framework guides the teacher appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a developmental focus. Formal observations of practice provide useful information about the quality of teaching. In addition, teachers and leaders are building their capabilities through regular inquiry and knowledge building to help improve positive outcomes for children.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the service have identified that the next key steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural practices</li>
<li>evaluation in assessment, planning and review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Rongotai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Rongotai will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>1 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
