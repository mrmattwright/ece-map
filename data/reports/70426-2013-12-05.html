</table><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool is one of three early childhood centres in Christchurch with the same owners. The three centres are all strongly influenced by the philosophy of Reggio Emilia.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia philosophy makes significant use of the environment as a way of extending children‚Äôs learning. Teachers provide children with a balance of structured and free-choice learning experiences that are appropriate for their needs. The teachers are learners alongside the children.</p><p>The centre is situated in a ‚Äòhome-like‚Äô setting in two separate buildings. The nursery, toddler and preschool areas each have their own separate, well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>There are seven qualified teachers, one teacher in training and one untrained support teacher. They have a commitment to making ongoing improvements to the programme and practices through planned self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is an important part of how this service operates. The Reggio Emilia approach is highly evident in the ways teachers relate with children, the set up of the environment and the way the programme responds to children‚Äôs interests and wonderings.</p><p>Children, parents, whƒÅnau and families are warmly welcomed into the preschool. There are respectful, positive and friendly relationships among children, and among adults and children.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and young children benefit from caring interactions with their teachers. Teachers use a number of effective ways to help children to settle successfully into the learning programme. Teachers carefully listen to children, follow their interests and actively include them in the programme. They create many and varied opportunities to engage children in learning. Teachers use effective probing questions to help children think deeply and talk about their ideas. Teachers integrate te reo and tikanga MƒÅori naturally into the learning programme.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs curriculum provides children with a rich variety of learning opportunities, both within and beyond the centre. There is a wide range of detailed documentation about the current programme and children‚Äôs learning that help parents understand the programme and their child‚Äôs participation in it.</p><p>Key strengths of the centre‚Äôs programmes include:</p><ul>
<li>creativity through art experiences</li>
<li>independence</li>
<li>child choice</li>
<li>promoting positive behaviour and social skills</li>
<li>ongoing investigations and project work.</li>
</ul><p>Children play in well-planned, purposeful spaces that make good use of the natural environment and resources. Children benefit from playing with equipment that can be used in a variety of ways to foster their exploration and curiosity.</p><p>Journals about individual children‚Äôs learning show that teachers know children, their strengths, and their interests well. Managers provide teachers with clear guidelines for planning.</p><p>There is a strong culture of teamwork amongst teachers. They regularly support each other and have frequent discussions and meetings focused on children‚Äôs learning. Teachers use practices that help them work together in identifying what is working well and what could be improved (self review). Teachers follow useful guidelines to help them record their self-review process.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. A feature of the centre is effective management systems and support. Managers have well-developed long-term plans that focus on making improvements over time. Managers have high expectations for what effective teaching and learning should look like. They provide regular, well-targeted and purposeful opportunities for teachers to extend their skills and knowledge.</p><p>The centre managers of the three Rabbit Patch Centres have regular opportunities to provide leadership support to each other. They make good use of their strengths and skills to develop consistent practices and promote improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have made good use of self-review processes to identify appropriate areas for continued improvement. They have identified that they need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the teacher appraisal system to ensure their high expectations for teaching continue to be consistently met</li>
<li>self review by making more use of children‚Äôs perspectives and sharing the process and outcomes of self review more with parents.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that other next steps include building on existing good practice in assessment by ensuring children‚Äôs learning journals are more easily accessible to children during the programme, and developing further ways to incorporate parents‚Äô perspectives on their children‚Äôs learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rabbit Patch Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rabbit Patch Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education.
