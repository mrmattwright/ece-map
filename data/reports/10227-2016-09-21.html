</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Simply Kids Preschool is a privately owned, semi-rural, all day education and care centre. It caters for up to 28 children, including eight children under two years of age. The majority of the children attend less than a full week.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy emphasises children learning about themselves and their place in the world. Building relationships, celebrating cultural diversity and responsiveness to children and whƒÅnau are key values that underpin practice. Education and care is guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The extensive outdoor area promotes children's play. An enclosed space for a variety of small animals provides opportunities for children to learn about farm animals.</p><p>The owner/ manager employs four registered teachers, one provisionally registered teacher and three unqualified staff. Most teachers are part time and work on a roster of approximately three days a week.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report recognised many good aspects of the centre, including strong tuakana teina relationships among children, and the attractive learning environment. These aspects are still evident. Since the report the centre owner and teachers have made positive changes to the centre‚Äôs programme and the philosophy. Further work is required in planning long and short-term goals that clearly identify priorities and associated goals towards achieving the centre‚Äôs vision.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre are happy and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Respectful, responsive relationships and interactions underpin the centre‚Äôs warm and welcoming tone. Teachers know children and their whƒÅnau well. Parents value the team‚Äôs strong commitment to supporting the needs of all families. Children with special learning needs are well supported in their learning and external support is provided when it is required.</p><p>Children are friendly and confident learners. They have fun, are encouraged to explore resources and are able to make choices about how and where they play. They initiate their own learning and enjoy imaginative play. Teachers could now put a stronger focus on empowering children to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others.</p><p>The environment provides opportunities for mixed-age play. Teachers care for infants and toddlers in a small separate space within the comfortable indoor learning area. Gentle, respectful teacher practice has allowed strong relationships to develop between children and their teachers.</p><p>Teachers make links to children‚Äôs home experiences and follow their interests to promote learning. Teachers ask children questions and wait patiently for them to respond. This respectful approach gives children time to think, helps them to develop oral language skills, and supports their wellbeing. It would now be timely for all teachers to consider ways to extend children's thinking and learning.</p><p>Learning programmes have a strong focus on increasing children's connections with nature. The centre is well resourced to engage the interest of children. Wall displays reflect the children‚Äôs learning and programme activities.</p><p>Teachers are committed to extending bicultural practice. They use basic te reo MƒÅori in interactions with children and have learnt about the history of the Onerahi area. Cultural celebrations are evident in displays, and centre resources provide opportunities to extend children's knowledge of MƒÅori culture.</p><p>Children‚Äôs portfolios are well used by children and their families. They provide a valued record of children‚Äôs learning journeys. There are some good examples of children's learning being extended.</p><p>The owner/manager promotes an inclusive and caring leadership model and supports a collective approach to teaching and learning. Teachers work collaboratively, sharing strengths. They have a strong commitment to continuously improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Recently reviewed policy and procedures provide good frameworks for centre operation. To enable the owner and teachers to achieve their shared vision of a high performing centre they could use current information about quality early childhood practices as they review their practice. In order to meet the Education Council requirements for endorsing teacher registration, further work is required.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO suggested and the centre owner/manager agreed that in order to sustain continuous improvement the next steps for centre management include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening self-review processes to include outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an annual plan, and aligning this to the strategic plan to guide centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently evaluating the effectiveness of the programme in order to further support children's learning</p>
</li>
</ul><p>implementing robust, improvement focused staff appraisal, and including appraisal of management by an external appraiser.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Simply Kids Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Simply Kids Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h4>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
