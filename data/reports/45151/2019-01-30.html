</table><p>Cherry's on Maryhill¬†is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cherry's on Maryhill is a privately-owned centre that provides full-day education and care. It is licensed for 45 children, including 14 children under the age of two. It is located in a converted house with two separate play spaces for over two and under two year old groups.</p><p>The owner operates two centres in Christchurch. The collaborative leadership team consists of a general manager, centre manager, team leaders and curriculum leaders. The teaching staff are qualified and certified early childhood teachers, or are in training.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises children's sense of wellbeing and belonging in a homelike setting and play garden. The centre is an Enviroschool, which forms the foundation of beliefs and sustainable practices. Children are viewed as capable, confident learners.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Leaders and teachers have made good progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2014 report. Teachers ensure children have many planned and incidental opportunities for mathematical learning. There are effective systems in place which enable teachers to build their knowledge about how they can support children's on-going learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's sense of belonging is carefully nurtured through caring and respectful relationships, a positive centre culture, settled learning environments and well-established routines. Children are encouraged to have positive and sensitive relationships with each other and their environment. As an Enviroschool, the curriculum is strongly aligned to the centre's philosophy, vision and values, and to future sustainability. The learning that matters at this centre is clearly evident in its philosophy. The natural outside play area encourages exploration, creativity and imaginative play and is designed to challenge and develop children's physical skills. It is highly reflective of the centre's core values and the Enviroschool's philosophy.</p><p>Teachers actively take the time to know children and their whƒÅnau. All children have a teacher who is their primary caregiver. Learning stories clearly show children's learning and progress and value families' contributions. This assessment process builds children's identity as successful learners. Te WhƒÅriki (2017) the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum is used to inform assessment and planning for children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are involved in children's learning and play and are highly responsive to children's needs and interests. They effectively seek children's ideas and opinions so they can contribute to the programme. Curriculum development is promoted through these interactions with a deliberate focus on oral language, mathematics and literacy. Children are involved in meaningful learning experiences inside and outside the centre, including purposeful trips into the local community. Leaders and teachers have developed close relationships with local schools to further enhance opportunities for learning.</p><p>Children and their families benefit from effective, well planned transitions into, across and out of the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are very well supported. Teachers are highly aware of the specific needs of very young children. They provide responsive care-giving that supports infants' and toddlers' needs for strong and secure attachments to adults. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to make choices and take risks in a nurturing and safe environment.</p><p>Teachers regularly include te reo MƒÅori in their conversations with children. They are increasingly including aspects of te reo and tikanga MƒÅori across the curriculum. This is helping MƒÅori children to recognise and take pride in their cultural heritage. As a result of targeted professional development, Pacific children's culture and heritage is now highly valued.</p><p>There is a strong sense of collaboration and reflective practice amongst leaders and teachers. Teachers are inquiring deeply into the impact of their practice on children's learning. Teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles and responsibilities. Their talents and expertise are effectively used and they are well supported by the owner and centre manager.</p><p>A well-developed policy and procedures framework is in place as a result of effective professional collaboration between the two centres. This ensures high expectations for teaching and learning and consistency of practice and operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified that to consistently meet Education Council registration requirements, they need to include in the online appraisal process:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an annual attestation summary report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formal observations and written feedback to teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be timely for leaders to regularly evaluate the goals in the strategic plan to determine the effectiveness of the strategic directions, as outlined in the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cherry's on Maryhill completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cherry's on Maryhill will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
