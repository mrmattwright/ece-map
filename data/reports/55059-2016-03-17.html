</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamatea Playcentre is one of ten early childhood centres administered by the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association, (the association) which oversees governance operations. A board of governors provides guidance and support for members.</p><p>The playcentre is located in the Napier suburb of Tamatea. It offers group supervised sessions one morning per week for a maximum of 25 children, including up to 15 children up to two years of age. Of the 13 children enrolled, three identify as MƒÅori. Parents cooperatively provide the programme and are assisted by an employed centre support person.</p><p>The January 2014 ERO report identified that significant improvement was needed in: assessment, planning and evaluation, the bicultural curriculum, self-review, supervision of children, enacting of health and safety procedures and staff appraisal. Key next steps identified for the association focused on ensuring the centre was effectively governed and managed.</p><p>Playcentre members and the board of governors at the association received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). The association has also provided ongoing support and professional development related to the key next steps.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre members have made good progress in addressing and improving the key areas identified in the previous ERO report. They have participated in ongoing professional learning to build their understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation, the bicultural curriculum, self-review and staff appraisal.</p><p>Children and their parents have a positive sense of belonging with the centre. Children are supported and closely supervised during sustained, self-initiated, interest-centred play. Infants and toddlers play with their siblings and other children. Older children learn to take on leadership roles. A large area inside has been set aside for younger children's play. This is a focal point for modelling practices and parents sharing their children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>The curriculum is based on children‚Äôs individual and group learning. It is highly visible in the centre and accessible for children to revisit experiences and develop ideas for play. Excursions into the community are used as an extension to the learning programme. Members are committed to providing a bicultural curriculum. Some practices and learning stories reflect aspects of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori in the centre. Some whƒÅnau have shared their knowledge in the programme.</p><p>Routines are well-established. Meal times are a family-like occasion with children and parents saying karakia, and sharing food and conversations. Parents effectively support children‚Äôs wellbeing and social competence. The centre environment is often reorganised so the needs of all children can be met.</p><p>Playcentre members have increased their understanding of planning and assessment. Planning is collaboratively discussed and shared amongst parents. It is based on children‚Äôs interests and parents‚Äô aspirations for their children‚Äôs education and wellbeing. Some parents make links with their children‚Äôs emerging learning. Evaluations of the programme inform further development of the curriculum.</p><p>Portfolios are a good record of children‚Äôs interests, learning and skill development. Learning stories reflect the children‚Äôs perspectives and at times include their voice. Some parents are starting to make links with what they observe in their child‚Äôs play and the strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Useful and considered self-review and evaluation are used to make improvements. Children are central to this process when parents reflect on the outcomes that have occurred for them.</p><p>Parents welcome each other and ensure new families are supported during their transitions into the centre. Partnerships amongst families is valued. Marketing and promotion work, by office holders, has increased numbers attending the centre.</p><p>There has been good progress in establishing a committee to guide playcentre operations. A significant number of new parents are participating in playcentre training courses to increase their understanding of the curriculum, assessment and planning. This should contribute to building knowledge and expertise across the centre.</p><p>Clear operational policies and procedures are in place to guide practices specific to Tamatea Playcentre. Suitable health and safety policies and practices are evident. The centre committee has developed a new approach to the handover of office holder responsibilities. This is to ensure sustainability of systems and knowledge at the centre.</p><p>The centre support person is appraised each year based on a job description and identified goals. This role includes working with parents to develop their knowledge and practices related to their child‚Äôs education and care at the playcentre.</p><p>Improved association support has helped to embed appropriate and systematic practices for each session. This should contribute to improved sustainability of the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Parents, with support from the association need to address and continue to improve practices related to:</p><ul>
<li>increasing parents‚Äô conversations and questioning during play to prompt children‚Äôs exploration of their interests</li>
<li>development of the curriculum and resources to respond to infants and toddlers specific needs</li>
<li>assessment knowledge and practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamatea Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamatea Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
