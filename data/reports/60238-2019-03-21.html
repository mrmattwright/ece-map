</table><p>Hadlow Preschool¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.¬†</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hadlow Preschool is located in grounds of Hadlow Preparatory School, Masterton. It is owned and governed by the Trinity School's Trust Board (TSTB), which is also the proprietor of three Anglican schools in the Masterton area.</p><p>The preschool is licensed for 30 children, over the age of two years. It currently accepts children aged over three years. There are 35 children on the roll, 3 of whom identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>A new leadership and teaching team was appointed at the beginning of 2019.</p><p>ERO‚Äôs October 2015 report identified areas requiring further improvement. Good progress has been made in strengthening self-review, assessment and in developing teaching practices to give children opportunities to lead their learning. Strategic planning remains a focus for the new leadership team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning is fostered through play in meaningful and authentic contexts. Teachers support children to follow and creatively explore their interests. There is a calm, settled environment where curiosity, independence and self-management skills are promoted.</p><p>Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs interests and support them to extend their understanding and learning. Ongoing observations of children in everyday activities build a picture of what children can do and what they are interested in. Goals are identified in partnership with parents and children. Learning and progress is celebrated though informative and well-constructed learning portfolios.</p><p>Te ao MƒÅori experiences are offered within the curriculum. This year‚Äôs planned focus is on building teacher‚Äôs knowledge of te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori, supported by local iwi. Strengthening partnerships with whƒÅnau to better promote MƒÅori children‚Äôs success as MƒÅori is a next step.</p><p>Literacy is emphasised in the daily programme. Teachers provide a repertoire of literacy practices that enable children to observe, listen and play with language. Mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use mathematics in everyday life and to engage children in games where they choose the level of challenge.</p><p>Review and evaluation practices effectively enable the teaching team to discuss, reflect and evaluate how well their curriculum planning and implementation supports children's learning interests and progress.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported, in partnership with whƒÅnau. External support is accessed as appropriate. Teachers employ inclusive practices to enable children to learn with and alongside their peers.</p><p>Regular visits to Hadlow School enhance children‚Äôs feelings of security and confidence. Successful transitions to school are supported by effective partnerships between the preschool, families and local schools.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The new teaching team work collaboratively to develop shared understandings of good practice. Leaders have identified that a key next step is to review the preschool‚Äôs philosophy and align their strategic plan with the TSTB‚Äôs 2019-2024 strategy. The revised philosophy will be a pivotal document to guide the preschool's future direction.</p><p>Within the current appraisal process teachers have development goals, reflect on their progress towards these goals and receive feedback from others. Considerable work is needed to update and implement the appraisal and endorsement processes so they align to the standards for the teaching profession and include all aspects of a robust appraisal system.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hadlow Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to Governance and Management. In order to address this, the TSTB must:</p><ul>
<li>inform parents about the amount and details of the expenditure of any Ministry of Education funding received by the service.</li>
</ul><p>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008: GMA3]</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure that policies and procedures cover all requirements of the Privacy Act 1993 and the Human Rights Act 1993.</p><p>Since the on-site stage of the ERO review, the preschool has provided evidence that shows these aspects of compliance have been addressed.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
