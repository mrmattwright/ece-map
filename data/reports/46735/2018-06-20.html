</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ngapuna Early Learning Centre is located in Rotorua on the grounds of Hinemihi Marae. It is a mixed-age centre, licensed for 30 children with up to 10 under the age of 2 years. A significant majority of children who attend the centre are MƒÅori and some whakapapa to Hinemihi Marae. The service is privately owned. The centre manager operates a shared leadership model with kaiako.</p><p>The service opened in 2015 and this is the first ERO review. Kaiako have established a whƒÅnau based service where children can learn alongside extended whƒÅnau. Internal evaluation practices have focused on ongoing improvements to centre operations. There has been a complete re-build of the outdoor play environment. Reviewing and developing systems, processes and practices to ensure the smooth operation of the centre have been ongoing.</p><p>The mission statement aims for management and kaiako to 'work as one with whƒÅnau and mokopuna to teach and learn together embracing te ao hurihuri and to cherish te ao tƒÅwhito', where mokopuna are seen as the seed of our tipuna and tomorrows great leaders.</p><p>Through its philosophy the centre aims to provide a family friendly environment where children feel loved and cared for in a ‚Äòhome away from home‚Äô.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki and whƒÅnau potential is central to the governance, and embedded in the mission, vision and values. The centre manager provides highly-effective leadership. Relationships at all levels are based on genuine acceptance, trust and respect. Leaders and kaiako are strong advocates for tamariki and whƒÅnau. They give priority to minimising any identified barriers, to ensure children can access and participate in the centre programme. Providing equitable and positive educational outcomes for all children and whƒÅnau underpins all decision making at the centre.</p><p>The curriculum effectively responds to children‚Äôs interests, strengths and wellbeing. The inclusion of mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori enhances the wairua and mana of MƒÅori children. Kaiako naturally weave te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into all aspects of the programme. Tamariki are empowered to make spiritual and cultural connections. They demonstrate understanding and knowledge of tikanga Mana Atua and confidently participate in waiata and karakia. Tamariki are supported by kaiako to develop an awareness of, and be proud of their ancestral heritage, and to have a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Assessment and planning practices support tamariki including those who require additional learning support. Individual child portfolios celebrate children's achievements and progress. Kaiako are increasingly including whakapapa in assessment documentation and making connections to learning dispositions. Children's interests and strengths are identified and used to plan meaningful experiences to extend learning. MƒÅori children‚Äôs ways of knowing, being and doing are validated.</p><p>Kaiako encourage them to be capable learners and leaders. They involve tamariki in decisions that affect them, and contribute to centre decisions. The mixed-age group setting supports tuakana/teina relationships. Tamariki confidently take responsibility for the wellbeing of others and share their strengths to support peers in their learning. Young infants receive one-to-one personalised care. Tamariki learn in a centre culture underpinned by the values of whƒÅnaungatanga and manaakitanga. They are empowered to be confident in both the MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ environments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and kaiako need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the centre‚Äôs local curriculum to maximise opportunities for MƒÅori children to build a strong identity within the Hinemihi Marae community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement effective teacher appraisal procedures and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen centre strategic planning and systematic monitoring of progress toward the achievement of the vision and goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ngapuna Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the centre owner needs to ensure that there is adequate space and provision for teacher breaks, and for staff to assess, plan and evaluate.</p><p><em>[Ministry of Education Licencing criteria, PF9]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ngapuna Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
