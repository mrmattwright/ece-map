<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1<span>&nbsp;The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>The Nanny Company is a nanny service that provides home-based care and education for children from birth to five years old.</p><p>The service is made up of a number of networks in Christchurch, Nelson, Blenheim and Wellington. This review relates to the network 70129 in Christchurch. ERO worked with the licensee and team leader to determine the quality of the management systems and leadership. ERO also visited a sample of home-based care premises while children were in care.</p><p>The licensee and team leader work well together to foster a positive, professional team culture that is strongly focused on improving teaching and learning. They actively show care, respect and appreciation for the work of the nannies and visiting teachers.</p><p>Nannies, children and families are well supported by an experienced team of early childhood education visiting teachers. A number of these teachers have been with the service for a long time.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The service philosophy states that young children are best cared for in home settings. There is a focus on providing an environment where quality education occurs when children are in their own environment with a nanny who knows them and their family well.</p><p>The service places a strong emphasis on finding the nanny with the right personality and skills for each family.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>The service's philosophy and values were clearly evident in practice in the homes visited by ERO. Children were confident in their environment. They benefit from strong, responsive and respectful relationships that are formed with each child and their family.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s sense of wellbeing is nurtured through regular routines and a familiar home setting. Nannies are responsive to children&rsquo;s individual needs and interests. They provide caring and respectful interactions.</p><p>Nannies receive regular and effective mentoring and guidance from knowledgeable visiting teachers. They are given useful feedback to improve their practices, understandings and skills.</p><p>The service actively encourages nannies to develop close links with the community. They provide regular playgroups and outings that offer children opportunities to interact with others. This is also allows nannies to develop wider support networks.</p><p>Nannies, visiting teachers and parents regularly communicate using a wide range of approaches including face to face contact, written and an informative website.</p><p>Partnerships with parents are actively fostered. Parents&rsquo; views and contributions are highly valued and used to inform the direction of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The managers and visiting teachers have developed a new approach to programme planning that places greater emphasis on child-led learning.</p><p>Visiting teachers and nannies work closely in partnership to develop a learning plan for each individual child. Careful thought is given to the provision of appropriate resources and learning experiences to promote children&rsquo;s interests, learning and development.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning journals are attractive and provide a good record of their interests and strengths. Children&rsquo;s voice is valued and included in their learning stories.</p><p>The service provides valuable and useful information to inform parents and help children as they approach transition to school. The service is focused on supporting children&rsquo;s social and self help skills as part of the development of the whole child. Literacy and numeracy is integrated in meaningful ways within children&rsquo;s play.</p><p>The licensee, team leader and visiting teachers have a reflective and collaborative team culture. The service has high expectations and promotes practices that provide good quality care and education.</p><p>The managers provide effective levels of support and guidance. They recognise and make good use of the individual strengths of visiting teachers. The service provides opportunities for visiting teachers and nannies to participate in useful professional development to grow their knowledge and practice.</p><p>The licensee and team leader provide efficient systems to guide the successful operation of the service. Their self-review practices are having a positive impact on teaching and learning outcomes for children. They consistently monitor legal requirements, including health and safety practices.</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>The licensee and team leader have identified, and ERO agree, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop the service's priorities and associated goals for its future long term planning</li>
<li>build appraisal systems to include links to the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>give greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in guiding documentation.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of The Nanny Company - Southern One completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>22 January 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
