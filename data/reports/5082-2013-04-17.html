<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Northcote Kindergarten is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Northcote Kindergarten, located on Auckland&rsquo;s North Shore, provides education and care for groups of forty-five children per session. Older children are able to attend five morning sessions. Younger children attend three afternoons. The kindergarten caters for children from the local community who reflect diverse backgrounds and abilities.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular professional development and on-going support from professional services managers.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is to provide a safe, secure, exciting and enriching environment for children to experiment and learn alongside peers. It also aims to help children become socially competent through support and guidance from teachers and parents.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s 2009 report noted relationships and interactions between children, teachers and parents were friendly and reciprocal, and that children were imaginative and capably managed their own play. These characteristics continue to be evident. The report recommended developments to programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes to more specifically focus on the development in children&rsquo;s learning. Staff have responded positively to these recommendations.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>There is a calm and settled tone in the kindergarten and children learn and play together in cooperative and creative ways. They relate well to each other through their friendships and enjoy participating in conversations with adults and each other.</p><p>The learning environment is spacious and offers children opportunities to be creative, quiet or physically active. As part of a professional development programme and self-review, teachers are developing the environment to serve as an additional teaching influence. This is a positive progression for the programme where teachers aim, through changes to the way they set up the environment, to support children&rsquo;s independence to pursue their own ideas. Teachers agree to continue to explore ways that the curriculum and their teaching practice can best support children as self-directed learners and inquirers within the kindergarten environment. The kindergarten Association values and supports ongoing professional learning for teachers. This is contributing to shared team understandings and building individual teacher&rsquo;s skills.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to use strategies to observe to identify children&rsquo;s emerging interests and themes in their play. This is enabling teachers to plan possible learning outcomes that are significant and relevant for all children in the planning and programme.</p><p>The 2009 ERO report acknowledged the development of a bi-cultural curriculum in the kindergarten. Teachers have accessed professional training in te reo M&#257;ori, which is commendable. It is now timely for teachers to review and develop strategies and practices that promote success for all M&#257;ori children.</p><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming to families and foster relationships that encourage parents and wh&#257;nau to be involved in the kindergarten culture. Teachers now need to consider, however, ways of building a more effective partnership that allows them to engage more fully with parents in conversations about their children's learning and development. Teachers could build more culturally responsive partnerships with parents and acknowledge children&rsquo;s prior experience and interests to support their learning at a deeper level in the programme.</p><p>Families benefit from good processes and information to support children&rsquo;s transition to local schools. Class visits and children&rsquo;s participation in school events help build their confidence and promotes as sense of continuity as they form new relationships with adults and children within the school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten personnel agree that the key next steps for the teaching team include developing:</p><ul>
<li>a better understanding of self review as a means for bringing about ongoing improvement to promote positive outcomes for all children</li>
<li>bi-cultural competencies in their practice, planning and partnership with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori to support M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s success</li>
<li>professional understandings and adapting teaching practice so they are more responsive to the language, culture and identity of children and their families.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends, and kindergarten personnel agree, that through an appropriate partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau, teachers use the culture, knowledge and understandings of children and their families to design a meaningful curriculum and promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Northcote Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
