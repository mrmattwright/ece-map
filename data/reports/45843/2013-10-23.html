</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders (Childcare) @ The Park is a newly established, purpose-built early childhood service. It is one of eight centres under the Little Wonders Childcare umbrella. A centre manager and two team leaders work with teachers to provide childcare for children from birth to five years of age.</p><p>Since opening at the beginning of 2012, attendance numbers have grown rapidly. The roll is now close to its licensed limit of 100 children, including 45 up to the age of two who receive full day care.</p><p>This is the centre‚Äôs first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children‚Äôs learning and wellbeing are the prime focus in this service. The curriculum responds to the learning interests, preferences, strengths and capabilities of young children. Leaders have established a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>The centre's curriculum aligns closely with the principles and strands of <em>Te¬†WhƒÅriki</em>, the national early childhood curriculum. It helps children to connect with people, places, and things. The philosophy of the service is clearly evident throughout all rooms.</p><p>Teachers are well attuned to the variety of ways children express themselves. They use a range of strategies to develop and extend learning. They systematically evaluate their teaching practices and the impact these have on children‚Äôs growing understanding and learning.</p><p>High quality assessment and planning is consistent across the centre. This focuses on developing optimum learning opportunities and outcomes for children. Planning processes are clear and well understood. Every child has an Individual Learning Plan that includes learning goals developed in consultation with parents and whƒÅnau. Assessment information is kept in well-presented portfolios. These record children‚Äôs interests, development, learning and milestones.</p><p>Adult to child ratios of 1:3 in the babies‚Äô room support teachers to provide high levels of nurture and care. Teachers demonstrate clear professional knowledge about high quality care and education practices for babies and toddlers. Comfortable spaces cater well for children who are not yet mobile.</p><p>Thoughtful consideration is given to transition practices as children move through the centre. Room environments are calm and peaceful. The youngest children in the centre have primary caregivers who have a keen understanding of the needs of very young children.</p><p>Centre leaders ensure that teachers have sound bicultural understandings to build on the service‚Äôs commitment to supporting te ao MƒÅori. Teachers‚Äô confidence in using te reo MƒÅori is supported. Teachers consider the culture and language of each child, and seek ways to maintain and build on children's cultural identity. They are involved in a research project focused on building the cultural competencies for teachers of MƒÅori learners.</p><p>Communications provide parents with good information about their children. Babies have individual daybooks that are an effective daily record of routines and engagement in learning. Information for parents about how the early childhood curriculum prepares children for transition to schools is carefully considered and developed.</p><p>Centre management systems are well developed and effectively implemented. Leaders provide high levels of support to teachers. This is initiated through a strong induction process, continued in monthly one-to-one meetings with each teacher, and through a robust appraisal process which links to the Registered Teacher Criteria. Appraisal is strongly evidence based and includes useful feedback and suggestions for ongoing development.</p><p>Leadership among teachers is actively encouraged. Teachers‚Äô strengths are recognised and given opportunities to develop in ways that benefit outcomes for children. Educators expect to be part of a high performing team.</p><p>Self review is valued and effectively led. Leaders are focused on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing, systematic self review. They work collaboratively to ensure that changes to practice provide positive outcomes for children and the community. They model and promote strong teacher understandings about children‚Äôs learning, nurture and care.</p><p>Relationships within the centre are highly respectful of children and of adults. Trust is evident among all who are involved in the service. This culture supports debate, negotiation, problem solving and critical reflection.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the centre leaders should continue to use their self-review practices to identify areas requiring further development and support.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders (Childcare) @ The Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders (Childcare) @ The Park will be in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>23 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
