<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten is located in the Morrinsville Baptist Church complex. The kindergarten is governed by a management committee which is part of the Ezekiel Trust, which offers a range of local community ministries. It provides sessional education and care for children from two and a half years to school age. There are 65 children enrolled and seven are of M&#257;ori descent.</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in February 2010, the kindergarten has changed its hours to include a full-day option for children who are four years of age, one day each week. Leadership, management and the teaching team have remained constant and the kindergarten has been relicensed by the Ministry of Education under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) 2008</em> regulations. The management committee and staff have responded positively to ERO&rsquo;s recommendations. Staff have benefitted from professional learning and development related to assessment practice and appraisal.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy, based on Christian teachings from the Bible, is strongly evident in all aspects of the kindergarten programme and relationships. The management committee provides an appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies that guide centre practice. Long-standing and dedicated committee members bring a wide range of skills and experience to their roles and responsibilities. They are supportive of kindergarten staff and have strong links with the Baptist Church and wider community. The committee is well informed about all aspects of the kindergarten and carefully monitor progress against its annual plan.</p><p>The highly respected and experienced supervisor effectively models the kindergarten&rsquo;s Christian philosophy and best practice in early childhood teaching. She is focused on kindergarten improvement and enables teachers and parents to contribute their ideas and talents to enrich the programme for children. The supervisor, with support from the committee, has accessed external expertise to assist kindergarten development. This development is also enhanced through regular self review.</p><p>The Christian philosophy underpins the kindergarten curriculum. Particular features of the curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>meaningful integration of literacy and mathematics in response to children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>a focus on increasing children&rsquo;s understanding about the importance of caring for the environment</li>
<li>opportunities for children to express their creativity through the arts and imaginative play</li>
<li>regular outings that provide connections with the local community and people</li>
<li>routines that provide a sense of belonging and predictability for children.</li>
</ul><p>A recent focus has been to develop a greater presence of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme. The supervisor is leading this development and confidently promotes the use of te reo M&#257;ori with children and families.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes that are based on children&rsquo;s interests, questions and topical events. Planning is made visible for parents and children through wall displays that effectively encourage their active participation in the programme and kindergarten events. This participation is captured in individual profile books that are valued by children and parents.</p><p>A significant feature of the kindergarten is respectful and reciprocal relationships amongst teachers, children and their families. Teachers skilfully promote children&rsquo;s social skills and confidence by encouraging them to identify and talk about their feelings, respect the views of others, and work together cooperatively. They work alongside children and model quality language structures and vocabulary through engaging them in sustained conversations. Children have opportunities to be leaders in programme routines and teachers encourage tuakana/teina interactions.</p><p>ERO observed many examples of children learning through:</p><ul>
<li>confidently engaging in sustained, cooperative and complex play</li>
<li>accessing and using a wide range of quality resources and equipment</li>
<li>revisiting areas of play, interest and learning</li>
<li>taking responsibility for themselves, their belongings and the kindergarten environment</li>
<li>experiencing physical challenge within safe boundaries.</li>
</ul><p>Participation alongside responsive and perceptive teachers is contributing to children&rsquo;s view of themselves as capable and confident learners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the kindergarten supervisor have identified and agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly identify and document the implications that come from self review, teacher reflections and professional discussions</li>
<li>continue to build relationships with Ngati Haua to strengthen M&#257;ori perspectives in the kindergarten programme and practices</li>
<li>continue to refine and enhance assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>16 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
