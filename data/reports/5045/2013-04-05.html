<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Devonport Kindergarten is very well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Devonport Kindergarten provides sessional education and care for children between the ages of two and five years of age and is located close to Devonport town centre. The kindergarten is well established and operates with three fully qualified teachers. It has a very positive reporting history from ERO.</p><p>Devonport Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular topical professional development and on-going support from professional service managers.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten are drawn from the local community and represent several cultures. Children&rsquo;s cultural heritage is evident in the displays of programme planning.</p><p>The teaching team has been together for over a year. Teachers bring a variety of skills and attributes to their work and have established good teamwork that reflects their individual teaching skills. They have worked together to develop a meaningful philosophy based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a high quality programme that encourages children to be articulate and highly engaged. They make choices about their play, and work with concentration in friendly and cooperating groups. Their ideas are respectfully followed by teachers, who offer resources and prompts that encourage children to extend their learning. Children are confident about asking for what they need and to revisit their games over several days.</p><p>Teachers support children to consider their own work and to gain satisfaction from their efforts. They use effective questioning techniques to encourage children to think, solve their own problems and to express their thoughts. Teachers are respectful towards children, who reflect this in pleasant and friendly relationships with their peers.</p><p>Teaching programmes support children well to increase their competence and confidence. Nature study, literacy and mathematical and science concepts are woven carefully into the programme in meaningful contexts as part of children&rsquo;s play. Children are also familiar and confident with information and communication technologies.</p><p>Teachers collect good information about the programme in children&rsquo;s folders. Parents contribute stories and photographs from home and children&rsquo;s voice is also recorded. These attractive documents are valued by parents and children, and provide information to support programme plans. While developing the folders, teachers sought help from M&#257;ori parents about the wording they should include.</p><p>Teachers have had significant support from the M&#257;ori community that has assisted them to develop sound frameworks for the bicultural focus in the kindergarten. M&#257;ori children are supported to feel proud of their M&#257;ori heritage and children are becoming familiar with the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and use self-review processes to determine the effectiveness of their teaching practices. ERO and teachers agree that priorities for maintaining the quality of their kindergarten should be to acknowledge parent contributions to children&rsquo;s folders, and to make clearer links between assessment stories to demonstrate children&rsquo;s progress over time. Teachers also want to increase children&rsquo;s creative opportunities, and to continue to build their bicultural understandings.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Devonport Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governan<em>ce, management and administration.</em></li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>5 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
