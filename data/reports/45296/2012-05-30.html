<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left"><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p align="left">Pipis Childcare and Preschool is a new centre in the semi-rural Northland coastal community of Ngunguru. The service caters largely for children over two years old but also provides programmes for a small number of infants and toddlers. The owner has developed the centre to reflect the community lifestyle and has established very good relationships with families. She supports the staff development very well and is establishing sound management practices.</p><p align="left">The centre is an attractive, spacious learning environment where children are happy and confident. They share trusting relationships with teachers and strong friendships with their peers. Children enthusiastically access resources and move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments. Toddlers benefit from a balance of a specific programme for under twos and opportunities to mix with the older children.</p><p align="left">Teachers work closely with children sharing conversations about their learning, often prompting new ideas and making links to prior experiences. Teachers integrate aspects of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori into the programme and support children to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play. The centre leaders agree that teachers should now review their management of the programme. The aim of the review would be to enhance teachers&rsquo; focus on providing challenging learning experiences for children.</p><p align="left">The owner and senior teachers provide effective leadership for the centre. They communicate clearly with staff and families encouraging their contributions and fostering reflective practices. The leadership team agrees the next steps for development include refining self-review so that it is more closely linked to strategic goals and is better documented. In addition, the leadership team agree that it is important to identify strategic goals to support the success of M&#257;ori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Pipis Childcare and Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPipis Childcare and Preschool.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre is beginning its third year of operation. Until now the focus has been on settling children, growing the roll and establishing a cohesive team of teachers. The community lifestyle has a significant impact on the character of the centre in that no staff member works full time and all children attend the centre part time.</p><p align="left">Teachers have undertaken considerable professional development since the centre opened. This has included training in self review and revising the philosophy statement with an external facilitator. Centre leaders are actively working with their colleagues trained in primary teaching, to further develop their understanding of the early childhood curriculum.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><em>Relationships.</em> Warm and respectful relationships are a feature of the centre. In this small coastal community many children and adults have well established friendships outside of the centre. These positive relationships enable teachers to communicate effectively with families and support children to settle quickly and engage enthusiastically in the programme. As a result, children show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p align="left"><em>Supportive teachers.</em> Teachers consistently support children to be involved in the programme. They engage children in genuine conversations often asking questions that prompt children to explore resources or make links with experiences outside of the centre. Teachers foster opportunities for children to learn early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play and encourage their physical and creative development.</p><p align="left">The programme provides opportunities for teachers to promote self-help skills. They encourage children to be self managing during routines and support tuakana/teina relationships whereby older children help younger ones. Low key behaviour management strategies are generally effective, although at times children need help to follow through on instructions.</p><p align="left"><em>Learning environment</em>. The centre is a spacious, well resourced learning environment. Play areas are organised effectively to support children&rsquo;s easy access to equipment. The large deck area fosters children&rsquo;s smooth transition between indoor and outdoor play. Children enjoy an extensive natural area outdoors. While this environment is still under development children benefit from extensive grassed areas, tracks for vehicles and space for imaginative play.</p><p align="left">Toddlers are well catered for with a separate indoor environment and are able to share the playground with older children. A current initiative to provide a separate deck space for toddlers is enabling teachers to manage the level of stimulus for these small children and monitor the impact on their learning.</p><p align="left"><em>Leadership.</em> The owner effectively leads a collaborative leadership team. The team has developed transparent systems that provide good opportunities for staff to contribute to decision making and keep parents informed about centre operations. The owner is a sensitive and reflective leader who listens well to new ideas and shows a willingness to adapt and enhance practices. She strongly supports the professional development of staff and uses the appraisal process well to foster their learning.</p><p align="left">The centre leaders guide staff in the ongoing review of their practices. They have led several specific in-depth reviews and have initiated a daily diary that enables teachers to share reflections and engage in critical discussions. These strategies are a sound beginning for teachers to now develop a more formal cycle of review.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The leadership team and ERO agree on the following priorities for centre development.</p><p align="left"><em>Management planning.</em> The management foundation established over the past two years could be further enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>developing strategic planning that identifies projected goals for improvement</li>
<li>documenting an annual action plan to guide the implementation of strategic goals</li>
<li>streamlining records of self review</li>
<li>refining the appraisal process to include monitoring and interim targets for teachers&rsquo; goals</li>
<li>establishing specific goals to engage wh&#257;nau and support M&#257;ori children to achieve their potential as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><em>Programme management.</em> Teachers are interested in further developing children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios. Helpful steps to achieve this goal could include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>planning more specifically for their role in extending children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>identifying potential learning outcomes to focus their programme evaluations</li>
<li>using the resource Kei Tua o te Pae to guide the development of learning stories</li>
<li>reviewing the centre teaching philosophies so that teachers and parents have a shared understanding of how to effectively incorporate learning in the context of play.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><em>Teaching and learning.</em> Teachers agree children are ready for further learning challenges. Children would benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities to learn through ongoing projects that enable them to work collaboratively</li>
<li>more open-ended questions that challenge their thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>further development of information and communication (ICT) resources and more equipment to extend their upper body development.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Pipis Childcare and Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice the managers should ensure that climbing equipment is safely positioned and that the safe fall matting is adequate.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre leaders agree that:</p><p align="left">teachers should further extend the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences in conjunction with improving children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios</p><p align="left">the leadership team should further refine self-review processes and develop goals to support the success of M&#257;ori children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-pipis-childcare-and-preschool" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Pipis Childcare and Preschool</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Pipis Childcare and Preschool.</p><p align="left">Pipis Childcare and Preschool is a new centre in the semi-rural Northland coastal community of Ngunguru. The service caters largely for children over two years old but also provides programmes for a small number of infants and toddlers. The owner has developed the centre to reflect the community lifestyle and has established very good relationships with families. She supports the staff development very well and is establishing sound management practices.</p><p align="left">The centre is an attractive, spacious learning environment where children are happy and confident. They share trusting relationships with teachers and strong friendships with their peers. Children enthusiastically access resources and move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments. Toddlers benefit from a balance of a specific programme for under twos and opportunities to mix with the older children.</p><p align="left">Teachers work closely with children sharing conversations about their learning, often prompting new ideas and making links to prior experiences. Teachers integrate aspects of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori into the programme and support children to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play. The centre leaders agree that teachers should now review their management of the programme. The aim of the review would be to enhance teachers&rsquo; focus on providing challenging learning experiences for children.</p><p align="left">The owner and senior teachers provide effective leadership for the centre. They communicate clearly with staff and families encouraging their contributions and fostering reflective practices. The leadership team agrees the next steps for development include refining self-review so that it is more closely linked to strategic goals and is better documented. In addition, the leadership team agree that it is important to identify strategic goals to support the success of M&#257;ori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
