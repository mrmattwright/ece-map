</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matakana Village Preschool provides all-day education and care for up to 25 children over two years of age. The centre operates from a purpose-built facility in Matakana, close to Warkworth. Most children are Pākehā with a small number of Maori children.</p><p>The centre owner is a registered early childhood teacher, and is the daily manager and leader of the centre. Local qualified teachers make up the teaching team. Teachers have built close relationships with families. The centre leader has a clear vision for the centre. This is supported by parents and whānau from the local community.</p><p>Children are cared for and learn in a mixed-aged setting. A well organised, attractive outdoor area offers natural environmental experiences to challenge children. The indoor area is separated into spaces for children to explore.  </p><p>Matakana Village Preschool opened in April 2015. This is ERO's first review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, and play together happily in an environment where inclusive practices are fostered. They have trusting relationships with teachers. Tuakana teina relationships are evident, where older children support younger children. Teachers' interactions with children are nurturing and affirming. Teachers listen to each child, and conversations are respectful. They encourage children's social competencies and positive interactions with others.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children's interests. They focus on supporting children's ongoing learning, wellbeing and development. Children learn to be confident speakers. They have opportunities to collaborate and problem solve together. Mathematics and science are integrated authentically into the daily programme. Leaders and teachers are increasing opportunities for child-led play.</p><p>Children have good access to high quality resources in a natural environment that promotes children's learning. The outdoor area is spacious and attractively set out. It offers a range of activities and fosters a sense of adventure. Children engage in interesting challenges to help develop their physical skills and confidence. The indoor environment has inviting spaces which inspire children to explore.</p><p>Bicultural practice is developing. Teachers integrate te reo Māori in the programme, especially during mat times where children participate in karakia and waiata. Teachers are building their capabilities in te reo and tikanga Māori through bicultural professional development.</p><p>The centre leader models good leadership. Teachers have broad teaching experience, and they have developed a professional work culture. They collaborate well, and build shared understandings about teaching practice and improvement focuses. Distributive leadership is developing.</p><p>Teachers have established planning and evaluation systems. They plan activities from their observations of children's interests. While this approach helps teachers to provide activities that reflect children's interests, it does not yet identify specific teaching strategies or learning goals to extend children's learning.</p><p>Teachers regard children as capable, confident learners. They regularly record children's learning development, and share this with parents. Children can revisit their prior experiences through these learning records.</p><p>Teachers have built very good relationships with the local school. Effective transition practices are helping to promote successful outcomes for children. The preschool children frequently attend school events and are knowledgeable about new entrant class routines.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes and centre operations are well established. The recent review of the centre's philosophy statement reflects the usefulness of evaluation for improvement. The centre leader plans to update staff appraisal policy and procedures to meet Educational Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop te reo and tikanga Māori through culturally responsive practices using <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Maori Learners</em></li>
<li>developing multicultural links in the curriculum</li>
<li>focusing more on learning dispositions and skills in programme planning</li>
<li>strengthening strategic planning for ongoing development</li>
<li>refining teacher performance management and appraisal systems. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matakana Village Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the centre manager should:</p><ul>
<li>review induction processes for new staff</li>
<li>continue to rationalise policies and procedures, and review those in relation to the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act</em></li>
<li>implement risk assessment management (RAMs) procedures for excursions</li>
<li>review accident records for patterns and trends.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matakana Village Preschool will be in three years. </p><p>Steffan Brough<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
