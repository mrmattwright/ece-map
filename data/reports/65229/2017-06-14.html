</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This early childhood centre is privately owned. Since the last ERO review its license has been amended so it can have children who are under two years as well as those who are over two years of age.</p><p>The centre has had stable leadership and its staff includes a mixture of experienced long serving teachers and newer staff. Most staff are registered teachers.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. The owner and staff have made good progress towards addressing the recommendations relating to improving internal evaluation and partnerships with parents noted in its 2014 review report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is clearly evident in programmes and practices. This is particularly so in regard to the way children’s well-being and sense of belonging are promoted.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and children are positive and responsive. Teachers focus on making sure their interactions with children are nurturing and caring. Routines are flexible and take into account children's needs and interests.</p><p>Teachers successfully foster partnerships with parents through good communication. They actively seek and respond to parent's aspirations for their children in ways that enrich their learning. Regular social events supports relationship-building with family and whānau. Parent evenings help to increase their understanding of the centre’s philosophy and curriculum. </p><p>The centre’s curriculum provides children with an extensive range of learning experiences. The programme includes a good mixture of child and teacher initiated activities. Children's learning and development is supported by a wide range of quality resources and an interesting, spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>Elements of literacy, mathematics and biculturalism are successfully integrated into the centre's programme. The centre is inclusive of all. Staff value the culture and language of children and their families. The centre is responsive to children with special learning needs.</p><p>Teachers make effective use of practices that support children to build on and extend their interests. They develop their thinking and reasoning skills, confidence and independence. Children happily engage in a wide variety of exploratory play for sustained periods. They are confident and independent in the centre environment.</p><p>The centre's programme for children who are under two has been successfully established and is now a strength of the centre. The positive environment provided for these children, responsive routines and continuity in staffing foster children's social and emotional well-being. Their oral language is well provided for as is learning through playing with their peers and older children. Useful assessments and planning support the promotion of children’s learning.</p><p>A focus on improving centre practices has helped children to successfully transition into, within the centre, and on to school. Close liaison with local schools is aiding these transitions.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. Leaders are improvement focused and their decisions are well informed by critical reflection and regular self-review. Management practices promote collaboration, team work and good use of staff strengths to benefit their colleagues and children.</p><p>Annual plans successfully establish clear and appropriate priorities and focus actions. Professional discussions and development support ongoing improvements to teaching.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to review and improve the quality of group programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>building on the best of assessment practices</li>
<li>aligning documented appraisal procedures and centre practices more closely to Education Council requirements</li>
<li>extending the integration of bicultural perspectives into programmes, practices and key centre documents. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bounce Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bounce Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>14 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
