</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jumpstart Preschool Rimu is one of three locally owned and operated private early childhood education and care services in New Plymouth, operating under the Jumpstart umbrella. The centre is licensed for 65 children, including 15 up to two years of age. Of the children currently enrolled, 15 identify as MƒÅori and four are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The Nursery (children aged up to two) and Preschool (children aged two to four) are distinct, separately staffed areas within the centre.</p><p>The Jumpstart managing director supports the centre leaders (principals) and administrator in the day-to-day operation and ensures the strategic priorities are progressed. She works closely with and provides ongoing professional support to the principals and teachers.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises building strong, respectful relationships with children and parents. Promoting learning through play and development as socially competent capable learners are also emphasised. The philosophy is clearly shared with all who are involved in the centre.</p><p>The August 2014 ERO evaluation identified strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation practices as next steps. The centre, in association with the umbrella organisation, has successfully responded to these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in Jumpstart preschools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Well-considered and effective support for learning, respectful care of children and a focus on improvement enable Jumpstart Preschool Rimu to be very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Reciprocal relationships with parents and whƒÅnau are a focus and strength. Children and families demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>A wide range of high quality resources invites children's investigation and participation. The indoor and outdoor areas encourage involvement in a range of experiences, exploration, challenge and engagement with aspects of the natural environment.</p><p>Children demonstrate high levels of interest in the learning opportunities offered. Independence, social and self-management skills are well supported. Perseverance, ideas generated in play and oral language are reinforced and extended through conversations with others.</p><p>Adults in the Nursery develop close child-teacher-family relationships which allows them to understand and effectively respond to individual children‚Äôs cues and gestures. Care moments occur in a calm and respectful manner. The service's youngest children are given physical space and time to make their own choices.</p><p>Commitment to upholding <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> is evident. Te ao MƒÅori values and beliefs are strongly reflected through interactions, the environment and within the learning programme. Children are confident contributors to experiences in te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori. Leaders are focused on continuing to strengthen practices that contribute to success for MƒÅori children.</p><p>Children's interests and parent aspirations inform and guide the well-planned curriculum. Literacy, mathematics, science and creativity are well integrated.</p><p>A more individualised assessment and planning approach and focus on development of children's specific learning dispositions has been developed. An online programme that illustrates and celebrates the learning of individual children has been successfully introduced. It includes recognition of children's progress over time and enables two-way communication between families and teachers. 'My Learning Journey‚Äô reports and associated parent conferences provide a further opportunity for parents and teachers to share children's learning.</p><p>A well-considered transition process effectively supports children and their families as they move into, through and out of the centre. Many children at Jumpstart Preschool Rimu move to the adjacent Jumpstart School when they are approximately four years of age.</p><p>Teachers and leaders work effectively as teams and across the organisation to promote positive outcomes for children. Sharing ideas about effective teaching, learning and care practices in regular meetings develops consistency and improves teacher capability.</p><p>Centre-wide professional learning has positively contributed to the development of a curriculum to better promote children‚Äôs learning. A comprehensive appraisal process supports improvement for teachers and leaders. There are clear links to the Practising Teacher Criteria and a focus on teachers' regular inquiry into their practice to improve outcomes. Greater use of formal observations of practice and ensuring cultural competency dimensions are more integrated, is a next step.</p><p>Self review, ongoing inquiry, planning evaluations and appraisal, provide insight into the effectiveness of teaching practices. Leaders foster collaborative review that leads to positive change and improvement. Professional learning is building evaluative capacity. Deeper analysis and sense-making of evidence collected as part of this process should strengthen teachers' ability to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice on outcomes for children.</p><p>Well-considered strategic plan goals are developed by the managing director in consultation with the centre leaders. These are influenced by parent, whƒÅnau, community and teacher input. Parent and staff surveys affirm practices and identify possible areas for further strengthening.</p><p>Effective management and leadership supports centre operation and build capability to promote positive outcomes for children. Quality assurance and well-developed communication processes foster successful leadership, teaching, awareness of service and legislative expectations and high quality practices. Regular review supports compliance with expectations.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>To build effective internal evaluation capacity and capability across the organisation in order to evaluate how effectively the services curriculum improves outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jumpstart Preschool Rimu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jumpstart Preschool Rimu will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>17 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whƒÅnaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
