</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Pūtauaki is located in a residential area of Kawerau. It is licenced for 30 children from two years to school age, and operates under the umbrella of Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT). At the time of this review 32 children were enrolled including 25 who identify as Māori.</p><p>Central Kids Kindergartens' philosophy aligns with the principles and strands of the early childhood education curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Managerial and administrative support is provided by the head office team and includes aspects such as human resources, policy development, finance and cultural support. A professional leader provides ongoing support and guidance for the head teacher and teaching team. CNIKT provides significant professional learning and development for the early childhood education sector on a national basis.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy places a strong emphasis on whakawhanaungatanga, mahi tahi and acknowledging all people and their connections to the whenua. The same vision and values are evident through teacher appraisal and professional practice, which reflects the culturally responsive principles of the Ministry of Education document <em>Tātaiako</em>.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergartens reviewed in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teacher relationships with children and whānau are based on attitudes of acceptance, respect and a willingness to listen and change. Teaching practice reflects an increasingly well-developed understanding of the essence of the Māori child – their mana, wairua and mauri. Teachers are supportive and responsive. Intentional teaching includes open questioning, and often make links to Māori literacy, which is the current focus of internal evaluation. Teachers use positive guidance strategies effectively to help children to develop their social competencies, problem solving and self-management skills. Children with additional needs and challenges are well supported by the CNIKT service, external agencies and appropriately trained teachers. Whānau are fully involved as partners in their child's learning and development, especially during important transitions into and from the kindergarten. Children are well supported to become confident, capable life-long learners.</p><p>Inside and outdoor environments are thoughtfully prepared and presented to support children’s exploration and engagement. Extensive use is made of natural resources and children can engage with the living world through community gardens and the kindergarten's pet animals. Children benefit from extended periods of uninterrupted play so they are able to initiate and sustain their own learning. Older children are confident to help others, demonstrating the principle of tuakāna teina. Literacy, especially Māori literacy, and mathematics are well integrated into the daily programme. Children can also demonstrate curiosity and creativity through dramatic play, construction and physically challenging activities.</p><p>A strength of kindergarten is the depth of development of planning, assessment and evaluation based on <em>Te Whātu Pokeka</em>, the kaupapa Māori framework for assessment. Teachers actively explore contexts and methods that contribute to nurturing all aspects of Māori children. A deep knowledge of the child and their kaupapa is at the heart of teachers' understanding how children learn, and how this should be developed and recorded in partnership with whānau. The curriculum is strongly based on Māori ways of knowing, being and doing. Different sources of knowledge are sought and respected, so that children, teachers, whānau and community members can all contribute to learning experiences and the programme. Success for all children and their whānau, especially Māori, is normalised and promoted. Children’s language culture and identity are valued and affirmed.</p><p>Leadership practice is closely aligned with the centre’s inclusive and bicultural philosophy and is providing a shared vision and a sense of positive purpose for the kindergarten community. The head teacher and teachers have successfully established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, affirmed and celebrated for who they are, where they come from and what they bring. Whānau hui are held regularly, including the sharing of kai. These hui are a practical example of the shared approach to leadership, which allows teachers, whānau and children to contribute their different cultural knowledge and experiences to enrich the curriculum experienced by all.</p><p>CNIKT provides effective governance. The kindergarten is effectively supported by a professional leader. She provides regular and detailed reports and feedback to the head teacher and teaching teams. This supports the centre to meet legislative requirements, and to ensure that this practise aligns with the CNIKT philosophy. The organisation has created comprehensive systems and practices that effectively promote positive outcomes for all children. The trust has a strong commitment to empowering emerging leaders and also provides generous professional development for teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the next step is to consolidate and extend the current progress that has been made in curriculum and teaching practice, in partnership with whānau and the wider educational community.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Pūtauaki completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Pūtauaki will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>31 October 2017</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
