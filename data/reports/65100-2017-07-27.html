</table><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool - Airport is well placed to promote learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool – Airport is located near Christchurch International Airport. It is one of three locally owned and managed centres that share the same management structure. Each centre is strongly inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach. This includes making extensive use of the environment to entice investigation and extend children's learning. Teachers are learners alongside children. They play a key role in listening to children, observing them and documenting their work.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children from birth to school age. There are three separate rooms and outdoor areas for the different age groups. Home-made meals and snacks are provided at the centre.</p><p>The centre has some long serving staff. Most teachers are qualified and certified early childhood teachers. There has recently been the appointment of an Atelierista (resident artist). The centres are supported by a pedagogical leader who works across all three Rabbit Patch centres.</p><p>Managers and teachers have made sustained progress in addressing most of the key next steps from the 2013 ERO report. This includes strengthening the appraisal system, self review and assessment and planning. While the centre has made some progress increasing bicultural practices, there is a need to further develop bicultural perspectives in key centre documentation.</p><p>This review was part of the cluster of three Rabbit Patch centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are purposefully engaged by responsive interactions with their teachers. They are provided with many opportunities to be creative and imaginative. Children have easy access to spaces that are well resourced and encourage discovery and exploration. They benefit from group experiences that encourage them to use a range of descriptive language.</p><p>Teachers foster children’s oral language development, listen carefully and use a range of strategies to extend learning. Teachers provide many opportunities in expressive and creative arts to extend children's emerging interests. They extensively document children’s learning and involvement in these areas.</p><p>Teachers make good use of a wide range of quality resources to extend children’s learning opportunities and theories. The spacious outdoor environment promotes active participation and exploration in a natural environment.</p><p>The needs of infants and toddlers are well met by the teachers' use of calm, respectful interactions in a tranquil, child-focused environment. Children are sensitively cared for and guided by teachers who have an in-depth knowledge of each child and their family. They have access to a wide range of creative experiences and resources to support their development.</p><p>Parents are well informed about children’s learning and what they do at the centre. Leaders and teachers encourage parents to participate at the centre and welcome their contributions to the learning programme.</p><p>The centre manager builds positive, reciprocal relationships with local businesses and the surrounding community. They are regularly involved in the centre and contribute to children's learning in a range of ways.</p><p>The service-wide management team works well together. Managers have a strong commitment to achieving the Rabbit Patch vision. They implement an appropriate range of management systems and practices across the centres, including a thorough teacher appraisal process. Managers clearly communicate their high expectations of teachers to benefit children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Managers provide ongoing support to teachers by regularly observing their practice and giving relevant feedback. They present targeted internal professional development opportunities to assist teachers in their roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have developed a useful strategic objective to enhance Māori learners achieving success as Māori. ERO recommends that managers regularly evaluate how effectively this objective is evident in centre practices and key service and centre documentation.</p><p>Managers and teachers should also:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the recognition of children’s home language, culture and identity in key centre documentation</li>
<li>strengthen the evaluation of learning and teaching in planning processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rabbit Patch - Airport completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rabbit Patch - Airport will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>27 July 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
