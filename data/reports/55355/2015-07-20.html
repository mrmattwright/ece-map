</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cole Street Early Learning Centre is a small, privately owned and operated centre. The three owner/managers are the lead teachers. They continue to promote a family-type atmosphere, catering for a mixed-aged group of children up to five years.</p><p>Full-day sessions are offered. Children are expected to attend the centre at least twice a week to maintain continuity. Many children have siblings in the centre. Four year olds are offered opportunities that assist in their preparation for transitioning to school.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They demonstrate collegiality, professionalism and good communication. There is a strong focus on ongoing improvement. Low staff turnover contributes to children being well known and consistency of caregivers.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is strongly evident in centre practices and underpins strategic direction of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A calm, relaxed, nurturing environment supports children&rsquo;s play. Children are given space and time to direct their own learning. They access a good range of resources. Numeracy is highly evident. Good use is made of community resources to enrich the curriculum and to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Ongoing professional learning in bicultural practices has led to better staff understanding of te&nbsp;reo&nbsp;me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. They have strengthened links with local iwi. These actions have informed curriculum decisions and enabled teachers to integrate te reo M&#257;ori and cultural practices meaningfully into the programme. Teachers acknowledge the need to continue to strengthen their capacity.</p><p>Routines are unhurried, responsive and flexible to meet children&rsquo;s needs. Teachers make the most of these times to encourage independence, foster children&rsquo;s leadership skills through caring for others and wider centre opportunities.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge children&rsquo;s efforts and successes. Strong relationships with children and their families promote a sense of security and belonging.</p><p>Preparation for learning is well considered. The needs of children under the age of two are clearly identified and considered in programme planning. Clear links to goals in <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and children's interest are evident.</p><p>Aspirations parents hold for their children are known and considered. Plans based on centre goals are regularly modified to reflect children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Teachers identify that visually sharing centre planning with parents is a next step.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s profiles effectively capture the range of curriculum experiences offered, share individual&rsquo;s learning with their parents and provide opportunities for parents to comment. A next step is to better identify how teachers respond to children&rsquo;s changing needs and include bicultural learning.</p><p>Teachers connect with local schools and other centres to strengthen centre transition practices. They are working to develop better understandings of how best to link the early childhood and school curricula to better support each child's seamless movement to the next stage of education.</p><p>Leaders work well with other teachers, families and wh&#257;nau as a collaborative team. Parents are regularly consulted about centre operations. The management team utilises members strengths and has developed an operating model which suits the centre.</p><p>Professional learning is contributing to centre developments and direction. It is planned, directly linked to centre goals and uses local expertise and examples of good practice.</p><p>A newly developed appraisal process is being strengthened through linking strategic planning and the Registered Teacher Criteria. This has the potential to further support teachers&rsquo; growth and development.</p><p>Decision making is well considered. Reflection on issues results in sound and deliberate actions. Centre review practices have been strengthened as a result of recent professional learning, and they lead to improvements.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning is based on the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. Teachers have leadership opportunities as part of implementing these plans.</p><p>Next steps are to continue to strengthen review and strategic planning by building a better understanding of the process and the role of indicators. This should support leaders and teachers to evaluate the impact of change.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cole Street Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cole Street Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
