<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Kohimarama in Auckland is a well established service that continues to provide very good quality education and care for children up to five years of age. Effective practices identified in previous ERO reports have been sustained and further developed through useful self review practices and the provision of professional development for teachers.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive individual attention. High quality interactions support babies to settle and to form positive relationships with teachers and their peers. Toddlers are encouraged to be independent and to explore their environment.</p><p>Older children are confident, self-motivated and demonstrate a sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. They enjoy periods of imaginative, co-operative play. Teachers build warm, reciprocal relationships with families. These relationships support children to transition confidently into the centre. An attractive learning environment and a wide range of resources enhance children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers engage in respectful, affirming interactions with children. They support children to learn appropriate ways to manage their relationships and interactions with others. Some staff effectively model questioning techniques that prompt research and investigation in meaningful situations. The high number of adults in the centre enables teachers to work alongside children to support and extend their learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s strengths and interests are central to teacher planning, assessment and evaluation of learning. Teachers are responsive to children, noticing and nurturing their progress and development. Individual portfolios contain rich records of children&rsquo;s progress over time. Parent contributions are valued and used to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The centre operates within the framework of the Kindercare organisation and continues to provide effective professional and operational support for teachers. Long term goals and self-review systems support ongoing centre development. ERO and managers agree that teachers should continue to use self review to enhance teaching practices and maximise learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres Kohimarama was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKindercare Learning Centres Kohimarama.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Kindercare organisation&rsquo;s framework continues to guide centre operations and to provide ongoing professional support for staff. The centre director continues to lead centre development effectively and the centre is staffed by eight teachers, including four provisionally registered teachers who are working to obtain full registration.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report identified many positive features of the centre. These included effective care for infants and toddlers, comprehensive planning systems, strong parent-teacher partnerships, engaged children and effective self-review practices. These good practices remain notable features of the centre.</p><p>Centre managers have responded well to ERO&rsquo;s 2009 recommendations by continuing to strengthen self-review and consultation practices.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Capable children.</em> Children are confident, self-motivated learners who demonstrate a sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. They enthusiastically select resources and work well individually, as well as playing effectively in small groups. Children benefit from a variety of learning experiences within a programme that provides opportunities for imaginative play and uninterrupted periods of creative play. They are responsive to adults, articulate in their interactions, and manage their own behaviour very well.</p><p><em>Programme for infants.</em> Babies are effectively supported by high quality settling practices that support and maintain their individual routines. Children form trusting bonds with staff. Links between home and centre routines provide infants with comforting and familiar experiences. They are independent explorers who enjoy positive relationships with adults and with each other. Teachers know the children well, collaboratively respond to their individual interests and promote early language development.</p><p><em>Teaching practices.</em> Teachers are responsive to the care and learning needs of children. They interact positively and respectfully with children and provide very good support to help children take responsibility for their own behaviour. Teachers have extensive knowledge of children and their wh&#257;nau/families. They share important information through informative portfolios, informal conversations, centre notice boards and planning displays.</p><p><em>Reflective practices.</em> Managers provide leadership and support for developing reflective practice. Teachers regularly reflect on the programme and evaluate the extent to which outcomes for children have been achieved. The centre director has developed clear expectations for professional learning and encourages staff to continually consider ways to further improve their teaching, using research and best practice to prompt professional discussion.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that key areas for further centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the afternoon programme to ensure that staff are using their teaching skills to best effect to promote children&rsquo;s learning and to ascertain whether best use is being made of the outdoor environment</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen teacher effectiveness in extending children&rsquo;s problem solving and complex thinking skills</li>
<li>sharing good models for promoting te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori across the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres Kohimarama completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Effective practices identified in previous ERO reports have been sustained and further developed through useful self review practices and the provision of professional development for teachers.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive individual attention. High quality interactions support babies to settle and to form positive relationships with teachers and their peers. Toddlers are encouraged to be independent and to explore their environment.</p><p>Older children are confident, self-motivated and demonstrate a sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. They enjoy periods of imaginative, co-operative play. Teachers build warm, reciprocal relationships with families. These relationships support children to transition confidently into the centre. An attractive learning environment and a wide range of resources enhance children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers engage in respectful, affirming interactions with children. They support children to learn appropriate ways to manage their relationships and interactions with others. Some staff effectively model questioning techniques that prompt research and investigation in meaningful situations. The high number of adults in the centre enables teachers to work alongside children to support and extend their learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s strengths and interests are central to teacher planning, assessment and evaluation of learning. Teachers are responsive to children, noticing and nurturing their progress and development. Individual portfolios contain rich records of children&rsquo;s progress over time. Parent contributions are valued and used to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The centre operates within the framework of the Kindercare organisation and continues to provide effective professional and operational support for teachers. Long term goals and self-review systems support ongoing centre development. ERO and managers agree that teachers should continue to use self review to enhance teaching practices and maximise learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
