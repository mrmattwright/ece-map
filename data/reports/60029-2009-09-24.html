<a id="community-page" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Community Page</h2><p align="left">Woodhatton Playcentre¬†is one of eighteen parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association). The association provides policy direction for centre operations, as well as administrative services and quality management. Office holders, some of whom work in teams, are appointed to specific roles, such as those involving responsibility for education, liaison, property and finance. They, along with the centre support person (CSP) provide professional advice and guidance to all playcentres in developing and promoting the benefits of parent-led early childhood services.</p><p align="left">Since the August 2006 ERO review members have successfully redeveloped the outdoor play area. More recently the playcentre has been going through an unsettled period and has struggled to retain members. At the time of this review, membership was more settled and training levels increased. Members are working to build a sense of cooperation and community.</p><p align="left">The learning environment effectively fosters children and their families‚Äô sense of belonging. Infants and toddlers are safely integrated into the sessions. The redevelopment of the outdoor area has created a space that promotes investigation and exploration as well as offering a range of equipment for physical skill development.</p><p align="left">The child-centred, play-based programme is focused on fostering children‚Äôs interests. It provides for a range of challenging, sensory, expressive open-ended activities. Children are effectively supported by adults who genuinely engage with them in their play, using high levels of oral language.</p><p align="left">Assessment, planning, evaluation and self review are in the early stages of development. As many parents are new, more experienced members are slowly introducing them to these processes.</p><p align="left">In term 2, 2009 ERO reviewed twelve of the eighteen playcentres affiliated to the Hutt¬†Playcentre Association. These reviews highlighted, at association level, areas of good performance and some concerns particularly in relation to the quality of systems for monitoring accountability. As a result, ERO will undertake a special review of the Hutt Playcentre Association within six months of the confirmation of this report to evaluate the results of actions taken by the association to address concerns.</p><p align="left">ERO has requested that the centre develop an action plan to show how members will address the areas identified for improvement outlined in this report. This plan should be forwarded to ERO.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Dr Graham Stoop<br><b>Chief Review Officer</b></p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre‚Äôs self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO‚Äôs framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b>¬†‚Äì including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b>¬†‚Äì other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Areas of National Interest</b>¬†‚Äì information about how Government policies are working in early childhood centres.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b>¬†‚Äì assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p><a id="1-about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1.

Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left"><span>Before the review, the management of</span> Woodhatton Playcentre<span>was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</span></p><p align="left"><span>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at</span> Woodhatton Playcentre<span>.</span></p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>the effectiveness of governance and management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO‚Äôs findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The August 2006 ERO review identified that the centre philosophy was strongly represented in the programme of activities and children‚Äôs learning was based on their strengths and interests. Adults‚Äô interactions were positive and affirming and some members were skilled at integrating te reo MƒÅori. Planning, assessment and evaluation, increasing the use of te reo MƒÅori by all members and developing playcentre systems including strategic planning and self-review practices were areas requiring development.</p><p align="left">Since 2006 members have redeveloped the outdoor play area. More recently the playcentre has been going through an unsettled period. It has struggled to retain members in the office bearer positions, particularly as treasurer. The provision of a Supporting Parents Alongside Children‚Äôs Education (SPACE) session in 2008 helped increase centre rolls. This session finished operating in term 2, 2009.</p><p align="left">At the time of this review members stated that there has been improvement to roll numbers and the financial situation and centre membership has stabilised. Training levels have also increased.</p><p align="left">This playcentre provides three mixed-age sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.</p><p align="left">In order to undertake this evaluation ERO observed one mixed-age session, talked with members and sighted a range of relevant documentation.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><ul>
<li>Since the 2006 ERO review members have made good progress in developing the learning environment. The outdoor area has been significantly refurbished and is now attractive, safe and well-presented. There is ample space for a wide range of physically challenging and expressive play activities. The indoor area includes a suitable range of resources. Photographs of the children and families promote a sense of belonging. This good quality environment is enjoyed by children, many of whom are motivated and confident learners.<br><br></li>
<li>The new ethos that forms the playcentre philosophy is highly evident in practice. This is now documented as,‚Äù E tipu e rea - grow and flourish‚Äù, and ‚Äúwh√§nau tupu ngatahi - families growing together‚Äù. These are reflected in the warm and friendly atmosphere and the parents‚Äô beliefs in how these can be reflected in practice. For example, greetings and the sharing of kai are established protocols. The development of vegetable gardens by the parents reflects how they as a team plan to nurture children‚Äôs learning. As a result, adults and children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging to this playcentre.<br><br></li>
<li>Children‚Äôs love of books and stories is fostered. Adults‚Äô spontaneously read stories throughout the session. A range of books is easily accessible to all and adults are responsive to children‚Äôs cues when they wish to be read to.<br><br></li>
<li>Te reo MƒÅori me ≈çna tikanga are well integrated into the programme. Members have developed strong community links to support cultural development and high numbers of parents attended the noho marae weekend, organised by the association. As a result, many values and beliefs and aspects of MƒÅori culture are meaningfully incorporated into centre protocols.<br><br></li>
<li>Infants and younger toddlers are effectively and safely included in sessions. An area, outside of the general flow of play provides a suitable environment for them to explore a range of heuristic play materials and photographs specifically for their use. On the day of the ERO review, members seamlessly shared responsibility for their care and individual well-being was carefully monitored. These young children demonstrate trust in a range of adults and in their environment.<br><br></li>
<li>Children have ready access to a variety of open-ended learning experiences which are likely to foster their creativity, imagination and curiosity.<br><br></li>
<li>Adults are responsive and caring and genuinely engage with children in their play. High levels of oral language are maintained through reciprocal interactions. Praise and affirmation are well used for positive guidance. Some members skilfully demonstrate notice, recognise and respond strategies as they work alongside children. This supports children to be engaged and to persevere in their play.<br><br></li>
<li>Strong leadership and teamwork by members are helping to re-establish good playcentre practices and this supports the smooth running of the session. The environment is well maintained and children appropriately supervised. Good end¬†of¬†session procedures for cleaning ensure members are engaged in a group activity allowing them speedy and easy access to play areas.<br><br></li>
<li>Members are re-establishing assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Some are keeping well-considered records about their children‚Äôs participation in playcentre activities and aspects of learning. Displayed documentation about programme planning and Te Wh√§riki, presents suitable explanations and models for members to follow. Records of children‚Äôs developing strengths and interests are prominently displayed for everyone‚Äôs information. These, together with session summaries and ongoing discussion between members provide rich information about aspects of the programme and individual children. Centre leaders state that the new processes are resulting in greater interest and input from members.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for improvement</h4><ul>
<li>Some aspects of the learning environment require attention to promote independence, investigation and exploration. For example: children are unable to complete the painting process by accessing the drying area; the placement of music and construction together means that interruption of play in these areas is inevitable; carpentry is poorly presented; and the literacy table, adjacent to the piano, is not well sited to promote children‚Äôs engagement.<br><br></li>
<li>Some centre practices are not effectively supporting older children to make choices. While there are few older children on the roll and a choice of activities is made available, additional materials are often not well displayed or made easily accessible.<br><br></li>
<li>Members agree that their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation is in the early stages of development. While progress is being made, they have yet to reintroduce formal planning meetings, choosing instead to complete work more informally, though discussion in and after sessions. As many parents are new, long-term members have a strong focus on gently introducing them to playcentre rather than on more formal requirements. It is likely that further development will occur once more parents are contributing to planning and taking part in training.<br><br></li>
<li>Self review is not yet an established part of members‚Äô practice. Members are working to re-establish systems and develop centre policies and practices. Once the framework is established it is likely to provide a strong foundation that will better support members to review centre operations.</li>
</ul><h3>The Effectiveness of Governance and Management</h3><p align="left">In term 2, 2009 ERO reviewed twelve of the eighteen playcentres affiliated to the Hutt Playcentre Association. These reviews highlighted, at association level, areas of good performance and some concerns particularly in relation to the quality of systems for monitoring accountability. As a result, ERO will undertake a special review of the Hutt Playcentre Association within six months of the confirmation of this report to evaluate the results of actions taken by the association to address concerns.</p><p align="left">Details of this information can be found in the following playcentre reports: Lower Hutt; Belmont; Korokoro; Days Bay; Pinehaven; Normandale; Wainuiomata; Te¬†Marua/Mangaroa; Stokes Valley; Alicetown; Totara Park and Wallaceville.</p><a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Areas of National Interest</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>MƒÅori Children</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and whƒÅnau of MƒÅori children and focuses on the potential of MƒÅori children to develop as competent and capable learners.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><ul>
<li>The establishment of ‚Äúa home away from home‚Äù and the values of man√§kitanga, kaitiakitanga, whakapapa and whanaungatanga are embraced within the playcentre. Everyone is welcomed and respect is demonstrated. A strong sense of family is a feature of the daily programme and the development of good relationships amongst families is seen as a priority. Members encourage and support children‚Äôs social and cooperative play to foster positive interactions. A¬†commitment to partnership inherent in the Treaty of Waitangi is evident.<br><br></li>
<li>The regular opportunities made available for parents to share information are likely to provide good forums for M√§ori families to share aspirations they have for their children with others. In turn, this shared information is likely to result in some targeted support for M√§ori children to help them to achieve success.</li>
</ul><h4>Area for improvement</h4><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Members have identified that they have not yet formally discussed or made decisions about how they might go about identifying and meeting the aspirations parents may have for their children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Recommendation</h4><p align="left">ERO recommends that members formally discuss and make decisions about ways of identifying and meeting the aspirations M√§ori parents may have for their children.</p><a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left"><span>Before the review, the licensee and staff of</span> Woodhatton Playcentre¬†<span>completed an <em>ERO</em></span><em> Centre¬†Management Assurance Statement and¬†Self-Audit Checklist</em><span><em>.</em> In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</span></p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the course of the review ERO identified the following areas of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>The ratio of adults to children is not included in excursion notices.</li>
<li>Some heavy items, such as resources in the cot room and the stereo in the play space, are likely to fall if not restrained and cause injury in the event of an earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to address these the centre management must ensure that:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="left">1.1 Parents/guardians of each child have given written approval to the ratio to be used on any excursion outside the centre.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="left">[R27 3 (b) Education (ECC) Regulations 1998]</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="left">1.2 Heavy items likely to cause injury in the event of an earthquake are secured.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="left">[R23 (2) Education (ECC) Regulations 1998]</p><p align="left">In order to improve practice members should:</p><ul>
<li>request that all parents provide details of the current status of their child‚Äôs immunisations;</li>
<li>monitor the temperature of the water in the children‚Äôs bathroom; and</li>
<li>extend the centre policy to show the procedures for ensuring that there is always someone with a current first aid certificate present at each session.</li>
</ul><a id="6-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">6. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO, the centre support person and the centre management agreed that:</p><p align="left">The playcentre members, with support from the association, should develop an action plan that outlines how they will address the areas for improvement identified in this report and forward it to ERO.</p><a id="7-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>7.
