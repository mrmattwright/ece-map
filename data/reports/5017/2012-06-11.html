<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Raumanga Kindergarten is located in Whangarei. It operates within the Northland Kindergarten Association which provides good systems and support for kindergarten administration and operation. The kindergarten provides all day education for children over the age of two years.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s experienced teachers operate as a strong, cohesive team. The head teacher is a capable and collaborative leader, who values teachers&rsquo; individuality and strengths. A collegial approach to programme development and implementation supports effective practice.</p>
<p>A warm, welcoming and settled environment builds children&rsquo;s confidence and sense of belonging. Respectful interactions are evident amongst children and adults. Parents speak appreciatively of the family atmosphere, effective communication and support for families/wh&#257;nau.<span>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy of whanaungataunga encourages participation and a sense of community.</span></p>
<p>The learning environment is attractive, well organised and invites exploration. Children happily play individually, in pairs or in groups. Teachers respond appropriately, using well considered strategies to support play and demonstrating a commitment to encouraging social skills.</p>
<p>Planning and evaluation processes enable the teaching team to collaboratively assess and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and needs. Programmes are guided by children&rsquo;s interests and aligned with Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are considering ways in which parents and children can be more involved in planning and assessment practices to further build the learning partnership between teachers and families/wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Programmes clearly reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s teaching and learning philosophy. Teachers provide a wide variety of learning experiences and encourage children in making choices. Many opportunities are provided for physical activity and exploration of the natural world. A strong focus on te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori enables children to connect with their culture.</p>
<p>Long-term strategic planning is supported by effective self review and professional development. Teachers have a commitment to delivering quality programmes and improving outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Raumanga Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRaumanga Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report identified many positive features of the kindergarten. These related to the learning environment, programme management, and practices for promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and belonging and good communication with families/wh&#257;nau. These aspects of centre performance remain notable features of the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Kindergarten staff have responded positively to ERO&rsquo;s 2009 recommendations regarding the development of an oral language policy. They have also undertaken significant development of the outdoor area, resulting in an environment that effectively supports the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy of care for children and the nurturing of their learning.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging.Inclusive relationships are a key feature of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and culture.Parents/wh&#257;nau are greeted warmly at the kindergarten. Children engage happily in the programme and are supported by teachers who interact closely with them.Teachers model positive relationships and foster children&rsquo;s social competence. Staff have initiated innovative strategies to increase children&rsquo;s attendance and participation in the kindergarten. Valuable links with local schools are maintained and the kindergarten has effective processes to support children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p>
<p>Partnerships with families. involve them in kindergarten programmes and activities. Parents appreciate the family atmosphere, teachers&rsquo; sensitive approach to the care of their children, and the support provided to family/wh&#257;nau. Noticeboards provide good information about the kindergarten and community.<span>Staff know families well. They proactively seek information from them to support their children&rsquo;s learning and</span><span>Teachers acknowledge their role in supporting parents/wh&#257;nau as the children&rsquo;s first teachers.</span></p>
<p>Teachers are committed to developing competence and confidence in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori, and to the continued enhancement of provision for M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau.<span>Bi-cultural practices are very evident. The kapa haka group promotes connections with the children&rsquo;s culture, provides performance opportunities and is well supported by wh&#257;nau.</span></p>
<p>Learning environment. Attractive, well resourced and well maintained areas of play engage children in a variety of learning experiences. Children are able to easily access equipment, and move confidently between areas to explore and sustain their interests. Significant changes to outdoor areas have resulted in an environment that reflects the value the kindergarten places on natural science, outdoor experiences and physical activity as key elements in children&rsquo;s growth and development. Displayed material is varied, well presented, and reflects the inclusion of family and children in the programme. Information about the value of learning through play is displayed in relevant areas.</p>
<p>Teaching and learning. They work very collaboratively, promoting consistency in approaches and flexibility in programming. They are very responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs. External support is accessed for children as appropriate. Children demonstrate engagement and persistence in tasks. Teachers are committed to developing children&rsquo;s social skills and social potential. They provide options for children to promote self management and decision-making. Teachers provide good support for the development of early literacy and numeracy skills within programmes.<span>Staff have a shared understanding of the kindergarten philosophy and ways in which they can reflect this in their practice.</span></p>
<p>Reflection and self review. Extensive well documented self review is a feature of the kindergarten. This reflects the good support and monitoring services provided by the Northland Kindergarten Association.<span>Contributions from parents and children are evident in self-review processes.</span>A highly reflective culture and collaborative professional leadership by the head teacher also contribute to the centre&rsquo;s focus on ongoing improvement.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Planning, evaluation and assessment. Teachers are continuing to review processes for planning and evaluating the programme and assessing children&rsquo;s learning. They are trialling a range of strategies to increase parent and child voice in planning, portfolios and displays.</p>
<p>Oral language development. To give further effect to the kindergarten&rsquo;s oral language policy, teachers should continue to develop a range of effective teaching strategies to extend children&rsquo;s language development.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Raumanga Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2>
<p>ERO and teachers agree that teachers should continue to use their self-review processes to further refine and embed recently developed planning and assessment systems.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-raumanga-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Raumanga Kindergarten</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Raumanga Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Raumanga Kindergarten is located in Whangarei. It operates within the Northland Kindergarten Association which provides good systems and support for kindergarten administration and operation. The kindergarten provides all day education for children over the age of two years.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s experienced teachers operate as a strong, cohesive team. The head teacher is a capable and collaborative leader, who values teachers&rsquo; individuality and strengths. A collegial approach to programme development and implementation supports effective practice.</p>
<p>A warm, welcoming and settled environment builds children&rsquo;s confidence and sense of belonging. Respectful interactions are evident amongst children and adults. Parents speak appreciatively of the family atmosphere, effective communication and support for families/wh&#257;nau.<span>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy of whanaungataunga encourages participation and a sense of community.</span></p>
<p>The learning environment is attractive, well organised and invites exploration. Children happily play individually, in pairs or in groups. Teachers respond appropriately, using well considered strategies to support play and demonstrating a commitment to encouraging social skills.</p>
<p>Planning and evaluation processes enable the teaching team to collaboratively assess and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and needs. Programmes are guided by children&rsquo;s interests and aligned with Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are considering ways in which parents and children can be more involved in planning and assessment practices to further build the learning partnership between teachers and families/wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Programmes clearly reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s teaching and learning philosophy. Teachers provide a wide variety of learning experiences and encourage children in making choices. Many opportunities are provided for physical activity and exploration of the natural world. A strong focus on te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori enables children to connect with their culture.</p>
<p>Long-term strategic planning is supported by effective self review and professional development. Teachers have a commitment to delivering quality programmes and improving outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
