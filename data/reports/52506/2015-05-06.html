</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Levin Baptist Kindergarten is a community based centre that reflects Christian-based principles. Sessional and full day education and care for up to 40 children aged over two years is offered. The kindergarten is a ministry of Levin Baptist Church and operates under the governance of the Levin Baptist Trust. A representative of the trust is a member of the management committee, which governs the service.</p><p>A manager guides day-to-day operation. Leadership for curriculum design, review and monitoring the quality of teaching and learning is shared between the manager and teaching staff with some delegated responsibilities.</p><p>The Trust employs additional staffing in the kindergarten above the required ratio. Most staff are qualified and registered teachers. Since the June 2013 ERO report, some changes have occurred to staffing.</p><p>The previous ERO report found significant improvement was needed, particularly in relation to responding to children‚Äôs culture, language and identity and providing a responsive early childhood curriculum. Key next steps included developing the quality of assessment, performance appraisal, self review and evaluation, the literacy programme and leadership.</p><p>Since that time the manager and staff have worked to address areas for improvement and received targeted support to further develop their practice through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). They have also participated in private professional development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The manager and teaching team have made good progress in developing their knowledge of an appropriate and responsive early childhood curriculum. They have participated in ongoing learning opportunities to support their knowledge of children learning in a free play setting. The curriculum now provided for children is child-centred and play-based.</p><p>A bicultural perspective is strongly evident through the environment and aspects of the curriculum. At times staff use te reo MƒÅori in authentic ways with children. They acknowledge the need to continue to build their confidence and competence in using te reo MƒÅori. Appropriate Ministry of Education resources have been used to support staff in working with whƒÅnau MƒÅori. Consultation has also occurred with whƒÅnau focusing on their cultural aspirations for children. These aspirations are reflected through the programme. A teacher within the kindergarten is leading and supporting these initiatives.</p><p>While some progress is evident in the use of assessment, planning and evaluation practices, continued development is required. Staff carry out observations of children and highlight their interests and strengths. This information is regularly discussed in the team to promote a shared understanding of individual learning plans. Staff have identified that a next step is to clarify the purpose and use of assessment. Consideration should then be given to incorporating a range of assessment approaches which show a deepening and increasing complexity to children‚Äôs learning.</p><p>Group planning is completed on a seasonal cycle. This shared focus provides opportunities to extend children‚Äôs learning in areas of interest. Evaluation is beginning to inform ongoing programme design. Staff should consider how they can evaluate the learning objective in addition to the individual components of the programme.</p><p>Staff have designed and recently implemented useful initiatives to encourage parents to contribute to their child‚Äôs learning. Families are also informed of changes made to the kindergarten programme. Formal consultation about aspects of the early childhood programme has not yet occurred. It is timely for leaders to find out about parent satisfaction as a result of recent changes.</p><p>Staff have demonstrated a strong commitment to developing their knowledge of providing a responsive literacy programme within a play-based curriculum. Ongoing professional development and learning has supported staff in this approach. Consideration has been given to providing an environment that is a print and resource rich. Staff make use of the opportunities that arise to weave literacy teaching and learning throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Formal self review is not yet an embedded practice. Staff have established a useful framework for undertaking strategic review. Quality indicators have been established from a range of relevant literature and these are informing data gathering. Leaders have identified that strengthening the evaluative aspect of self review is a key next step. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>The appraisal process is robust. A key next step is to strengthen implementation by:</p><ul>
<li>using evidence to feedback on teacher goals and formally documenting this process</li>
<li>leaders supporting teachers with their next steps for development</li>
<li>teachers articulating clearly how they are demonstrating the requirements of the Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have participated in a mentoring programme which has improved administrative systems and processes. Opportunities for other staff to lead initiatives are promoted.</p><p>Staff have begun to consider how the progress of practice and ongoing improvements made at the kindergarten can be sustained. ERO agrees this is a useful next step. The management committee should also consider how continued mentoring and professional guidance can be provided to support leaders in their roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten leaders and staff should continue to focus on strengthening practice to improve outcomes for children. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to promote children‚Äôs culture, language and identity</li>
<li>establishing a shared understanding of the purpose and use of assessment and developing a range of assessment approaches to deepen children‚Äôs learning</li>
<li>strengthening the evaluative aspect of self review and undertaking formal consultation with parents</li>
<li>strengthening the implementation of the appraisal process and providing opportunities for ongoing mentoring of leaders.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Levin Baptist Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The privacy officer has a good understanding of the service‚Äôs responsibilities under the Privacy Act. To improve practice ongoing improvements should include securely storing archived documents onsite and clarification of permission concerning photographing children in the kindergarten.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Levin Baptist Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
