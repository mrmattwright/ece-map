</table><p class="title sixteen columns clearfix" id="page-title">Fairfield Early Education Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fairfield Early Education Centre is located in the grounds of Fairfield College, Hamilton. The centre provides full-day education and care for up to 61 children from three months to school age, in three separate age-based settings. The 52 children in the centre are representative of a culturally diverse community, including 19 who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Early Education Waikato (EEW); which operates seven Education and Care Centres and two homebased education networks on Hamilton.</p><p>Manaakitanga underpins the centre's philosophy. Teachers aim to support and encourage children to become capable, confident and competent life-long learners through respectful and trusting relationships in an environment that is safe, nurturing and fun.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2015, the centre has undergone a complete rebuild and was relicensed to reflect an increase in the centre roll. The centre manager was permanently appointed in February 2018 and there has been a complete change in the teaching team. In July 2018 the purpose-built centre was formally opened, and staff appointments have continued to increase with the growth of the roll. During this time all areas for improvement identified in the last ERO report have been attended to by the centre and EEW.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children actively participate in a programme that is very responsive to their learning and care. They are able to make choices about learning. Teachers acknowledge children's interests, value parent and whƒÅnau aspirations, and use these in planning. Portfolios capture children‚Äôs interests, engagement and learning and are easily accessible to all children and their families. An online platform supports wider whƒÅnau engagement and contributions. There is a calm and settled environment in a well-resourced and purpose-built learning environment.</p><p>Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is fostered through strong responsive and reciprocal relationships among teachers and whƒÅnau. The key teacher strategy is pivotal to building trusting relationships and secure attachments for children. This is particularly evident for infants and toddlers. Well-considered, responsive and individualised transitions foster children's wellbeing and confidence. Inclusive practices further support children with additional learning and development needs. Teachers work closely with parents and whƒÅnau to access outside agencies where necessary.</p><p>Teachers actively participate alongside children, encouraging sustained exploration and play. They genuinely listen to children and foster oral language development. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into learning experiences. Science exploration, music and dance are promoted. The centre is in the early stages of developing a localised curriculum that reflects Tainui heritage, Pacific children and other cultures. Leaders strongly promote and model culturally responsive practices. Te reo and tikanga MƒÅori are woven into daily routines and experiences.</p><p>Leaders have a strong focus on improving the quality of education and care. The centre manager is providing stability for children, whƒÅnau and teachers through a trusting, respectful and collaborative culture. There is clear alignment between strategic and annual plans, internal evaluation, professional learning, and staff appraisal and inquiry. Coaching and mentoring practices are providing leadership opportunities and growing teacher capability.</p><p>The centre vision, philosophy and effective day-to-day management promote positive learning outcomes for children. Sound policies, procedures and guidelines underpin centre operations. The recently reviewed strategic direction provides a clear vision for each child to reach their full potential. Governance demonstrates a strong commitment to providing quality education and care. This is evident through consistent resourcing that supports quality ratios for babies and toddlers, and the recent rebuilding of the centre and grounds.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers is to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>individualised assessment, planning and evaluation informed by specific learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visibility of individual children's language, culture and identity within the learning environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fairfield Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>29 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
