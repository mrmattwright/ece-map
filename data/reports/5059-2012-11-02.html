<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Teachers are well placed to support children's wellbeing, and with focused support from the Association, should become better placed to provide well for children's learning.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Idlewild Kindergarten is a culturally diverse centre in Mangere. The service provides morning and afternoon sessions four days a week for children over two years old. The session groups are wh&#257;nau based to support families and to encourage tuakana/teina relationships between siblings and cousins. The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides a policy framework and professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator also works some hours as a teacher aide to support teachers. The Association is consulting with teachers and the community about changing the kindergarten hours to reflect school hours (known as the kindergarten day model).</p><p>The teaching team has recently been re-established. Two teachers have several years' experience in the kindergarten, while a third returned from prolonged leave to rejoin the team in term three 2012. Teachers have recently developed an annual plan and worked with families to introduce environmental sustainability practices. Most of the areas for development that ERO identified in 2010 continue to be a focus for further improvement.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in five early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Caring relationships are a feature of the kindergarten. Teachers provide a welcoming environment for the multicultural community and encourage families to work with their children in the kindergarten. Parents are recognised as children&rsquo;s first teachers and their aspirations for children&rsquo;s learning are valued. Teachers foster positive tuakana-teina relationships between children as they learn to work in groups and respect each other. In this environment children show a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children enjoy exploring the kindergarten resources. Teachers purposefully stand back to encourage children&rsquo;s independent investigation. However, children&rsquo;s learning is enhanced when teachers work closely alongside them, prompting conversation and thinking skills. The challenge for teachers is to provide this good quality teaching more consistently.</p><p>Teachers identify children&rsquo;s interests to guide programme topics. They provide activities and resources that support children&rsquo;s interests, but could further enrich learning. A greater focus on integrating literacy and numeracy experiences throughout play, and being clear about the learning concepts they are promoting, would also help teachers to challenge children&rsquo;s thinking. Assessment portfolios are attractive records of children&rsquo;s participation in the programme. The quality of assessment and programme evaluation should improve when teachers plan more specifically to extend learning.</p><p>While the Association has been consulting with teachers and the community about changing the kindergarten hours to reflect school hours, planned work on the outdoor environment has been postponed. In the interim teachers must maintain a suitable and safe environment including managing rubbish, raking the sandpit and keeping the safe fall material free of moss and mould.</p><p>The professional services manager (PSM) provides good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Through her regular visits she raises teachers&rsquo; awareness of Association services, documentation and expectations. She has also supported teachers through the relicensing process. Her feedback through the head teacher appraisal process and visit reports has helped teachers to reflect on their planning processes, structure their new review format and evaluate the environment. Association PSMs have developed an action plan to help teachers address the areas for improvement identified in this report.</p><p>Teachers and the PSM agree with ERO that the next priorities for improvement in the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the documentation and depth of self review</li>
<li>identifying learning intentions to enhance the quality of teaching and learning</li>
<li>raising expectations that children will engage in challenging experiences and achieve tangible goals</li>
<li>extending the focus on children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity, and the extent to which these focuses are reflected in policies and management documents.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that teachers work with the PSM to implement the Association&rsquo;s plan for kindergarten improvement.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Idlewild Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>2 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
