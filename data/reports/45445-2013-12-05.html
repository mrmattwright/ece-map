</table><p>The Rabbit Patch - Saffron Street is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool ‚Äì Saffron Street is one of three early childhood centres in Christchurch with the same owners. The three centres are all strongly influenced by the philosophy of Reggio¬†Emilia.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia philosophy makes significant use of the environment as a way of extending children‚Äôs learning. Teachers provide children with a balance of structured and free-choice learning experiences that are appropriate for their needs. The teachers are learners alongside the children.</p><p>The centre is situated in a newly remodelled building. The two nurseries, toddler and preschool areas each have their own separate, well-resourced indoor and outdoor learning areas.</p><p>There are 13 fully qualified teachers and one unqualified support teacher. They have a commitment to making ongoing improvements to the programme and practice through self review.</p><p>The centre was opened in June 2010.This is the first Education Review of this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is an important part of how this service operates. The Reggio Emilia approach is highly evident in the way teachers relate with children, the set up of the environment and the way the programme responds to children‚Äôs interests and wonderings.</p><p>Children, parents, whƒÅnau and families are warmly welcomed into the preschool. There are respectful, positive and friendly relationships among children, and among adults and children.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and young children benefit from calm and nurturing interactions with their teachers. Teachers use effective ways to help children to settle successfully into the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers make good use of in-depth questioning to help children talk about their ideas and theories. They have long conversations with children about their ideas and ways to develop the child‚Äôs interests further. This supports and builds on children‚Äôs oral language development. Teachers integrate some te reo and tikanga MƒÅori into the learning programme.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs programme is well paced and child-led. It builds on children‚Äôs interests. Child choice is promoted and children's independence fostered. There is a wide range of tactile and sensory opportunities for children.</p><p>Children play in well-planned, purposeful spaces that make good use of the natural environment and resources. Children benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>playing with equipment that can be used in a variety of ways to foster their exploration and curiosity</li>
<li>spacious and attractive outdoor areas that provide them with good opportunities to learn about the natural world</li>
<li>participation in a range of interesting activities and experiences, including the use of community resources and links with local schools.</li>
</ul><p>Journals about individual children‚Äôs learning show that teachers know children, their strengths, and their interests well, and that they can recognise children‚Äôs progress in learning over time. Teachers receive effective feedback from the centre manager about the quality of assessment. Managers provide teachers with clear guidelines for planning.</p><p>There is a culture of effective teamwork. Teachers regularly support each other and have frequent discussions and meetings focused on children‚Äôs learning. The centre has in place a range of useful practices to help teachers work together in identifying what is working well and what could be improved (self review). Teachers follow clear guidelines to help them record their self-review process.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. A feature of the centre is effective management systems and support for staff. Managers have well-developed long-term plans that focus on making improvements over time. Managers have high expectations for what effective teaching and learning should look like. They provide regular, well-targeted and purposeful opportunities for teachers to extend their skills and knowledge.</p><p>The centre managers of the three Rabbit Patch Centres have regular opportunities to provide leadership support to each other. They make good use of their strengths and skills to develop consistent practices and promote improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have made good use of self-review processes to identify appropriate areas for continued improvement. They have identified that they need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the teacher appraisal system to ensure their high expectations for teaching continue to be met consistently</li>
<li>self review by involving parents more in aspects of the process, including sharing the steps taken and outcomes more with parents.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that other next steps include building on existing good practice in assessment by ensuring children's learning journals are available in the classroom to children and parents, developing further ways to incorporate parents‚Äô perspectives on their children‚Äôs learning, and promoting MƒÅori children‚Äôs cultural identities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rabbit Patch - Saffron Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rabbit Patch - Saffron Street will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>5 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
