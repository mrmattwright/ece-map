</table><p>The service requires external support to further develop its internal evaluation practices, clear understanding and documentation of effective governance, developing an engaging curriculum that is responsive to children's interests, and meeting legislative requirements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whiz Kids is a privately owned centre that offers full day education and care for up to 35 children, including 12 children under two years old. Enrolments have increased significantly over the past three years. All children identify with MƒÅori heritage, and some also have MƒÅori/Tongan identity.</p><p>The centre owner has managed a complete change of staff since ERO's 2013 review. Five staff are registered teachers, and two are training in relevant qualifications.</p><p>Key next steps in ERO's 2013 review included the development of assessment and programme evaluation, developing robust self review and improving the quality of conversations with children. These areas continue to need further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>While ERO has concerns about aspect of this centre's operation, there are positive features that contribute to children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Acknowledging MƒÅori as tangata whenua is central to all centre systems, practices and organisation. Teachers strongly enact their commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. They use their knowledge and understanding of te reo and te ao MƒÅori in meaningful ways in the programme.</p><p>Children in this centre are active and confident. Nurturing and caring relationships are well established. Children and their whƒÅnau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers maintain a calm slow pace with infants and toddlers that promotes children‚Äôs wellbeing.</p><p>Children enjoy positive relationships with each other. There are good examples of literacy, mathematics and science being naturally incorporated in the programme. Children show a strong sense of belonging and know that teachers value their culture and background.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of effective assessment and planning. Teachers could now strengthen the children's engagement in the programme by genuinely listening to them and exploring their deeper meanings in learning through open questioning. This approach would help teachers to more fully acknowledge children as capable, self-managing learners.</p><p>Teachers have benefited from recent professional learning and development about literacy in early childhood education. The centre owner is keen to work with her staff to develop a systematic way of evaluating the effectiveness of the curriculum and of teaching and learning that builds on this professional learning. Teachers should also increase their knowledge of current theories of learning, and use this knowledge to design the curriculum and make assessment responsive to infants‚Äô, toddlers' and young children‚Äôs deep interests. They should review the learning environment, particularly for infants and toddlers, to evaluate the extent to which it promotes children's natural curiosity, invites exploration and responds to children's interests.</p><p>Teachers are justifiably proud of the attractive all-weather outdoor area at the front of the centre. The play area at the back of the centre provides ample space and opportunity for physical activity and challenge. Teachers should ensure that children of all ages have ongoing access to the outside learning environment and to a variety of resources that encourage imaginative play.</p><p>The centre owner promotes shared responsibility for strategic and annual planning. Further work is required to make planning more meaningful. The challenge is to develop alignment between long and short-term planning, action plans, systems and practices that focus on positive outcomes for children. The planning needs to clearly define the centre's key priorities for development and how these are to be achieved.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and teachers need support to strengthen curriculum, governance and management. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing an engaging curriculum that clearly responds to children's interests and empowers them to lead their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing consistent positive guidance for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing a stimulating environment for children, including infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering ways to improve independent access to outdoors areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing more specific, aligned strategic and annual planning that guides ongoing development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing policies and procedures to better reflect good practice and legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whiz Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance in Whiz Kids. To meet requirements the service must improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teaching practices and curriculum evaluation that demonstrate an understanding of children's learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of internal evaluation that promotes improvement in all areas of centre operations , including all required policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systems for staff performance appraisal and the endorsement of teacher practising certificates that meet the requirements of the Education Council of New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records of parent approval for the ratios of adults to children, and assessment and management of hazards, in relation to excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Vulnerable Children Act 2014, HS17, Education Act 1989.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whiz Kids will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
