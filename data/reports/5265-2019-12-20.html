</table><p><span>Roslyn Kindergarten¬†<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Roslyn Kindergarten is located in Palmerston North. Opening hours are Monday to Friday from 8.30am until 2.30pm. Full day places are available to children from two to six years. At the time of this review, there were 32 children enrolled and seven identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises 'manaakitanga/whanaungatanga (relationships), kotahitanga (connectedness), ukaipotanga (belonging and contribution)'.</p><p>The kindergarten is administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association). The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the chief executive officer who is responsible to the board. An operations manager supports the service‚Äôs compliance and policy development. Two senior teachers provide educational leadership across the teaching teams.</p><p>Since the September 2016 ERO report, most teachers are new. The ERO report identified that strengthening internal evaluation and the assessment, planning and evaluation process was required. Although some progress has been made to address these areas, they remain key next steps.</p><p>This kindergarten is part of Palmerston North East KƒÅhui Ako.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews and one early learning service review in the Ruahine Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Trusting, respectful and nurturing relationships between teachers, children and families are highly valued to promote a strong sense of belonging within the kindergarten. Children settle quickly into their play and engage with a wide range of open-ended resources. The philosophy is highly evident in practice.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take on leadership roles and confidently contribute to the daily curriculum. Deliberate teaching strategies foster children's developing social and emotional competencies and are consistently implemented. Teachers model effective practice to support early language development. Predictable routines and expectations promote a sense of security during times of transition.</p><p>Aspects of te ao MƒÅori are woven throughout the curriculum. Connections to the natural world and links with the wider community are well promoted. Shared gardening opportunities and a focus on sustainable environmental practices promote kaitiakitanga. Children experience waiata, karakia, and opportunities to learn local iwi pepeha. Favourite stories are used to make links to MƒÅori and Pacific children's cultures to extend their learning in meaningful ways.</p><p>Children from diverse cultural backgrounds are well supported in an inclusive learning environment. Good use of Ministry of Education equity funding is used to provide additional staff to support the needs and first languages of children and their families. Teachers work alongside parents and access external agencies as needed.</p><p>A collaborative approach to planning responds to children's individual needs and interests. Children's learning portfolios show their participation and engagement in the curriculum. Teachers continue to build their knowledge of children‚Äôs unique cultures, languages and identities to enhance learning opportunities. Further refining the assessment process is a next step to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the visibility of children's cultural contexts, particularly for MƒÅori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently document the impact of targeted strategies to progress children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers work collaboratively to build teacher and leadership capability. There is a strong commitment to growing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning, research opportunities and the sharing of good practice.</p><p>A recent review has led to improved teaching strategies and initiatives to progress children's oral, language and literacy development. As a new team, the next step is to continue to build a shared understanding of effective evaluation for improvement. This should support teachers to identify what is working well and who for, to inform future decision making.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Robust systems and processes are in place for monitoring, reporting and evaluating the quality of operations. Information is used to inform decision making and to improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At kindergarten level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to refine the planning, assessment and evaluation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a shared understanding of effective internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level, the Ruahine Kindergarten Association have identified that their priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen and build their knowledge and understanding of tikanga MƒÅori and seek engagement with local iwi, with kaumatua support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support Roslyn Kindergarten to implement internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roslyn Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai P≈´tahi Nui</span></p><p>20 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
