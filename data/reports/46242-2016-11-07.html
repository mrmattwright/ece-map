</table><p>While there are good learning experiences provided in homes for children there is an urgent need to improve management and leadership practices including the documenting of health and safety systems. There is a concern about the viability of the service with only 3 children enrolled at the time of the review.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO review of the AKO-hia Home-based ECE Service, which was established in 2013. and works within a kaupapa MƒÅori framework. A central part of the service‚Äôs philosophy is to support and nurture each child on their learning journey. Providing a bilingual curriculum underpinned by concepts of ako, aroha and whanaungatanga underpin the service‚Äôs approach to home-based education and care. Kaitakap≈çkai/Educarers and whƒÅnau are encouraged to participate in adult education opportunities.</p><p>The service provides for children up to six years of age and all Kaitakap≈çkai are in the south Auckland area. Kaitakap≈çkai work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. Children enrolled in this network are all of MƒÅori heritage. Children and kaitakap≈çkai speak both MƒÅori and English during the day. One visiting teacher/kaiako, who is a registered early childhood teacher, visits homes and supports kaitakap≈çkai to provide educational programmes for children. The service provider/owner is responsible for the overall governance of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Respectful and responsive relationships underpin the positive interactions between children and kaitakap≈çkai. Children experience a culturally responsive curriculum that affirms their wairua, mana and whakapapa. They play and learn in home settings that affirm their identity as competent MƒÅori learners. Te reo me ≈çna tikanga MƒÅori are embedded in everyday activities.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be curious, and to make choices and discoveries as they play. Children are able to make connections with the wider world and interact positively with familiar adults. Their emotional wellbeing and sense of belonging are well supported through nurturing individualised care with kaitakap≈çkai.</p><p>Assessment documents show kaitakap≈çkai have a very good understanding of individual children‚Äôs interests, strengths and preferences. They show a good range of learning opportunities in the home and community settings.</p><p>Working with and supporting whƒÅnau is a priority for the service. The owner, kaiako and kaitakap≈çkai have developed trusting relationships with whƒÅnau and tamariki. They are keen to build on these good relationships and encourage whƒÅnau to contribute to their children‚Äôs learning goals. Service leaders are clearly committed to the principle of inclusion and demonstrate understanding and empathy in this area.</p><p>The overall management of the service is guided by a kaupapa MƒÅori approach. A sound policy and procedure framework is in place. The owner, visiting teacher and kaitakap≈çkai share a strong commitment to the service's vision and philosophy. They work collaboratively, utilising group and individual strengths to enact the philosophy and foster positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service owner agrees that key next steps to improve the quality of management include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing a robust process of self review that includes systematic policy review, is evaluative and focused on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring a person responsible is available at all times the service is operating for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan to guide ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring and evaluating the progress and outcomes of the annual plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service owner also agrees that key next steps for the kaiako include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documenting conversations with whƒÅnau and using this information to help them plan for children‚Äôs learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting how she coaches and mentors to improve kaitakap≈çkai/educarers practice</p>
</li>
<li>ensuring that kaitakap≈çkai maintain the required health and safety records.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of AKO-hia Home-based ECE Service completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure systems for monitoring hazards, health and safety procedures and other legal requirements in homes are monitored and documented.</p>
</li>
<li>establish documented self review</li>
<li>
<p>ensure a person responsible is available at all times the service is operating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a system of regular appraisal</p>
</li>

ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
