</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carterton Preschool Littlies is located in Carterton. It is a new centre owned and operated by three experienced, registered early childhood teachers. It caters for up to 30 children aged from birth to three years. The day-to-day running of the centre is the responsibility of the team leader.</p><p>The centre provides mixed-age learning areas to meet the developmental needs of younger children. The philosophy is evident in practice. A primary caregiving system enables children to develop secure attachments.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy focuses on warm responsive and respectful interactions to support children‚Äôs sense of belonging. Children and parents are warmly welcomed on arrival. Parents spend time settling their children with the support of teachers. A home-like atmosphere prevails.</p><p>Children learn in a happy and secure environment. Routines are calm, unhurried and responsive to the needs of children. Independence and self-help skills are encouraged. Choices for children are highly evident. Teachers use routines as learning opportunities.</p><p>The centre philosophy and curriculum are guided by <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children‚Äôs emerging interests. Ongoing discussion guides programme planning. There is an established procedure for assessing children‚Äôs learning. Teachers agree they should continue to develop assessment practices to show the breadth and complexity of children‚Äôs learning over time.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They engage in conversation with the children as they play and offer support and encouragement. Language development and a love of books are fostered.</p><p>Teachers are developing their confidence to use te reo MƒÅori for instruction and during routines. Leaders have acknowledged the need to continue to develop staff bicultural practices.</p><p>Children lead their own learning. They have easy access to a good range of resources appropriate to their ages and stages of development. Natural resources are integrated. These provide opportunities for children to develop early mathematical concepts of colour, shape, size and capacity.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to support children‚Äôs learning. Ongoing communication ensures the needs of children are responded to as they move within and between the indoor and outdoor spaces.</p><p>Positive relationships with parents, families and outside agencies and well-planned transitions support the inclusion of children with special education needs.</p><p>Leadership is supportive and focused on providing high quality education and care provision for children. Parents are regularly consulted and contribute to the programme and centre operations.</p><p>Teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development to strengthen their practice. It is now timely to better align this to staff appraisal and the strategic direction of the centre.</p><p>Self review is beginning to inform decision making. Leaders recognised that self review is at early stages of development. Strengthening teachers‚Äô knowledge and understanding of the purpose of self review and how the process can be used to support ongoing centre developments should improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree on the following next steps, to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to strengthen teachers‚Äô knowledge and understanding of self review and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to develop staff bicultural practices</li>
<li>align professional development to appraisal and strategic priorities</li>
<li>continue to review how easily children can independently access toilet facilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carterton Preschool Littlies completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the centre management should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>a record of all medicine given to children left in the care of the service includes evidence of parent acknowledgement.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS28]</em></li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the centre has provided ERO with additional information to show that steps have been taken to address this non-compliance.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Carterton Preschool Littlies will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>15 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
