</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mahora Kindergarten is located in Mahora, Hastings and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. It is licensed for up to 40 children in the morning and 30 children in the afternoons. It offers both morning and afternoon sessions and an extended day of six hours, within an all-day licence. Children are representative of a diverse community.</p><p>The teachers are welcoming and responsive. The teaching team is fully qualified and the kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two education managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have access to a wide range of learning resources in a play-based programme. Teachers work alongside to support them in their play and learning. Some teachers use effective strategies to add challenge and complexity to children&rsquo;s learning. Greater consistency by teachers in using a wider range of teaching strategies to extend children&rsquo;s learning is a key next step.</p><p>Teachers support children&rsquo;s developing social and emotional competence effectively through a recent focus on mindfulness. This is where they support children to work in a collaborative and cooperative way and to share their thoughts and feelings with one another.</p><p>Teachers have identified it is timely to review the kindergarten philosophy to show how the focus on mindfulness is valued in the programme. ERO affirms this direction. To support the implementation of the agreed philosophy, the teaching team should then collectively determine and record indicators of what best practice looks likes for their curriculum.</p><p>The spacious environment encourages children to explore and engage in imaginative play. They are confident to make choices and have a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten. Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers liaise with external agencies to support the child and family where appropriate.</p><p>Clear expectations are established through regular communication with parents for supporting their child to successfully transition into the kindergarten setting. Children and families are also supported as they transition onto school through access to a range of appropriate resources. Teachers are knowledgeable of the local schooling community and share this information with families.</p><p>Well-presented profiles highlight children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme, developing relationships, and at times, skills and approaches to learning. Assessment practices require further development.</p><p>Next steps should include celebrating children&rsquo;s cultural identity through these documents and regularly revisiting and reflecting parents' aspirations. Planning to extend children&rsquo;s learning should be formally documented and enacted to more effectively show learning and development over time.</p><p>Teachers are continuing to build their confidence and competence in the use of te reo M&#257;ori. They are strengthening their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori through participating in the Harae Whakamua initiatives supported by the association. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Success for M&#257;ori and Pacific families should be further enhanced through consulting with parents about cultural aspirations they may have for their child.</p><p>Spontaneous review is being used to reflect on aspects of the programme and make ongoing improvements. In order to strengthen self review and evaluation teachers should develop a clearer understanding of the process and build their evaluative capacity to know how well they provide for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to leaders and teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear longterm direction for the association. Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide professional support and guidance and access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers&rsquo; capabilities in te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori through the introduction of the Haere Whakamua project. This project is based around progressing the organisation&rsquo;s journey in becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identifies, and ERO confirms, that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>updating the appraisal process and policy</li>
<li>providing clear expectations, through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations and monitoring their implementation.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the philosophy and develop shared indicators of best practice</li>
<li>improve the consistency of the use of intentional teaching strategies to extend and deepen children's learning</li>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>consult with M&#257;ori and Pacific families about cultural aspirations</li>
<li>strengthen self review and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor implementation</li>
<li>undertake strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mahora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mahora Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>10 April 2014</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
