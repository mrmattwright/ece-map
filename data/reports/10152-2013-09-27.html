</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Bears Early Childhood Centre, on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, provides full day education and care for children from the surrounding districts. The owner leads a qualified and well established team of teachers. The centre has recently been relicensed by the Ministry of Education under the 2008 regulatory framework. The centre provides an education and care programme for children between two and five years of age.</p><p>The comprehensive and aspirational philosophy developed by teachers states that Bright Bears is committed to providing a safe, nurturing and positive environment for children and their families. The overarching goal is that children will leave the centre as happy, competent and confident learners.</p><p>The centre has children who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Teachers develop positive relationships with families and interweave aspects of children‚Äôs cultures into the programme as a way of promoting a sense of belonging and enrichment.</p><p>The centre was last reviewed by ERO in 2010. The report suggested that parent partnerships should be extended, and that teachers should review their ways of promoting the success of MƒÅori children. Teachers have strengthened these aspects of the programme, with a particular focus on integrating te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori into the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly greeted when they arrive at the centre. Positive relationships between teachers and children are obvious and children settle to play quickly. The day starts with opportunities for children to make choices about their play by selecting from the wide range of activities available to them.</p><p>Children respond enthusiastically to opportunities to develop their self-chosen play. They are imaginative, sharing ideas and negotiating their play. Children develop their own understanding about literacy in these meaningful contexts as part of their games. Routines during the day include opportunities for children to learn about literacy and numeracy in more formal ways. Teachers could now use self-review processes, including a review of relevant literature and research, to evaluate the effectiveness of these two approaches in helping children gain deeper understanding about the foundations of literacy and numeracy.</p><p>Teachers successfully integrate te reo me ngƒÅ tikanga MƒÅori into the programme. Children understand basic words and phrases in te reo MƒÅori and are able to sing MƒÅori action songs and waiata. Teachers also incorporate songs and words in the home languages of those who have English as an additional language. Wall displays and a focus on festivals important to cultural groups help children to gain a sense of belonging and contribution.</p><p>Children benefit from the high quality resources and equipment provided for their play. The environment is attractively organised to encourage children‚Äôs exploration. The outdoor area is set up to help children to make choices from a number of activity options and physical play. The indoor playroom is well used to display children‚Äôs artwork.</p><p>Teachers keep parents well informed about their children‚Äôs time in the centre. At present, teachers are developing on-line portfolios as a way of informing parents about children‚Äôs progress and their participation in activities. This development could also provide a good opportunity for teachers to comment about children‚Äôs learning through play.</p><p>Teachers have started to use self review as a tool to assess their work with children. It would now be useful for teachers to use their philosophy statement as a starting point for reflecting on the ways in which they feel the programme successfully meets their aims and increases the effectiveness of teachers‚Äô practices.</p><p>Management of the centre ensures that the property is well maintained. The manager is updating some aspects of personnel management. New appraisal processes are currently being developed to align with the criteria for teacher registration.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In discussion with the manager and a staff member, ERO proposed that next steps for the centre include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>review curriculum with a focus on assessment and planning to promote teachers‚Äô reflection about their teaching</li>
<li>develop appraisal processes that will usefully support teachers to identify individual performance goals and areas where professional development would strengthen practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Bears Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Bears Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
