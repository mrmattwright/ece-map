</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Queens High Preschool is a small service located on the grounds of Queens High School. It has a close association with the high school. The centre is a community-based, non-profit service governed by a trust board of parents.</p><p>Children from birth to five years old attend the centre. While the centre is structured in two areas, for children under and over two years of age, there are many opportunities for mixed-age interactions. Staffing has been stable for several years and is well balanced with new and experienced teachers. Most teachers are qualified early childhood educators.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review identified a number of areas for improvement. There has been some progress towards meeting the recommendations. This includes setting valuable learning priorities for children, and developing and implementing internal evaluation and aspects of the system for appraisal. Internal evaluation and appraisal remain areas for improvement in this report.</p><p>The board and centre manager have developed useful guidelines for roles and responsibilities. New members to the board now go through an induction process to support them in this role.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Queens High Preschool receive good quality care and education. However, there are significant aspects of governance and management that need to be improved in order for the centre to be well placed to improve and sustain its performance.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p>Children are confident and capable learners. They play and learn in a family-like atmosphere. They benefit from respectful and caring relationships with their teachers and each other. They have a strong sense of belonging, developed through many outings with the community and further afield. </p><p>Children under two have a safe, calm area where they spend time exploring and developing strong connections with adults who are familiar to them.</p><p>Early literacy and numeracy teaching and learning happens naturally throughout the daily programmes. Careful attention is paid to ensuring children make smooth transitions through and out of the centre. The head teacher for the older children has established good relationships with local schools and provides support for parents to help the transition process.</p><p>Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of children and their families. They have good relationships with parents. Parent aspirations for their child's learning and development are sought and included in planning and learning stories. Teachers use this information well to support and extend children's learning and interests</p><p>Parents’ opinions about how the centre is providing for their children are sought regularly and analysed. The changes made as a result of this need to be recorded to support strategic management and internal review.</p><p>Stories about children's learning show links to the centre priorities and Te Whāriki, the Early Childhood curriculum, with some next steps evident. Strategies teachers use to support children's next learning are becoming more evident in learning stories, but this is not yet consistent practice. All children are discussed and planned for by the teaching team on a regular basis.</p><p>Children are becoming familiar with te reo and tikanga Māori and Māori perspectives. This is an integral part of everyday language and programmes.</p><p>Teachers work well together to manage the daily routines and programme. Their strengths are respected and valued and used effectively to benefit children's learning.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken a number of evaluations. The process they have followed has good aspects to it but needs a stronger focus on answering 'how well' things are working, and includes indicators to measure quality against. Nevertheless, some of these evaluations have led to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Systems to support the functioning of the centre are in place. Some of these are working well but need to be improved to be more effective. Aligning priorities, internal evaluation topics, appraisal goals, and teachers' professional development with a future-focused strategic plan would improve purpose and efficiency.</p><p>The centre needs to improve governance and management systems and practices to improve outcomes for children. The leaders need to seek external support to build the capability and capacity of the board and centre manager to more effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities in the areas of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning to better guide future direction and to support and improve practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation including a schedule for reviewing key aspects of learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>becoming familiar with and understanding Early Childhood Education Guidelines that support good practice and licensing criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership and management.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Queens High Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><p>ERO identified that some aspects relating to the manager's appraisal need to be improved to demonstrate good practice.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Queens High Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>12 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
