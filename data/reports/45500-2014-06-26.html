The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>how well the curriculum and teaching practices support children to be independent learners</li>
<li>the use of assessment information to plan age-appropriate learning experiences for the children</li>
<li>the use of self-review systems and strategic goals to promote quality learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunshine Christian Preschool is administered by the Manukau Christian Charitable Trust (MCCT). The preschool is licensed for 80 children, including five up to two years of age. Currently children from three to six years old are catered for in three large rooms and in a small classroom. Strong Christian beliefs, values and teaching principles underpin the centre philosophy and curriculum.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy reflects the Trust Board’s commitment to providing early childhood education for children from mainly low socio-economic backgrounds. The Trust offers an integration of education-based services to support families and children to become life-long learners.</p><p>Children at the centre continue to spend time in two age-related groups. They take part in a variety of both structured and play-based programmes. A small group of predominantly Māori and Pacific children between the ages of five and six participate in a daily transition to school programme.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report expressed concern that the curriculum for children featured an over-emphasis on structured tasks directed by adults, including formalised numeracy and literacy. ERO recommended that children be provided with increased opportunities to become independent learners and to develop problem-solving skills consistent with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. To support this, the report also recommended that teachers should develop more age-appropriate programmes for groups of children.</p><p>ERO recommended that the preschool seek support from the Ministry of Education (MOE) to meet its licensing requirements more effectively.</p><p>This 2014 report identifies that Sunshine Christian Preschool requires continued development in the areas outlined in the terms of reference in order to strengthen positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>There has been some positive enrichment of the learning environment. A wider range of equipment is accessible to children and provides them with increased opportunities to make choices about their engagement in learning activities. There is now some flexibility around children being able to play in other rooms. However, children are still quite dependent on teachers. Further progress is needed with curriculum design and teaching practices to better support children to become independent learners.</p><p>The quality of learning interactions and conversations with children suggest that some teachers are in the early stages in their understanding of what it means to be an effective teacher. There is a need for continuing external professional training to help teachers to consistently engage in appropriate high quality learning interactions with children.</p><p>The programme continues to require further development. Providing increased opportunities for children’s input into the programme is an important area for development. Next steps are for teachers to use children’s individual interests to guide the programme, and to ensure that there is a range of child-initiated learning interests to stimulate ongoing learning.</p><p>Teachers put a great deal of effort into planning, and are increasing their understandings of how to plan effectively to meet the differing needs of young learners. However, further work in this area remains a priority, and professional support is needed to help teachers develop and implement a shared understanding of good planning, assessment and evaluation that is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the centre’s licensing requirements.</p><p>Self review also requires further development. Spontaneous reviews often do not result in action plans. It is not clear how long-term strategic planning is being used to improve centre management or the quality of learning outcomes for children. The centre’s philosophy, long-term strategic planning and annual planning should all align so that governance and management values, vision and goals are used to strengthen learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The Trust, through centre managers, leaders and teachers should focus on supporting children to become more independent learners by:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop programmes based on the different interests and needs of children</li>
<li>continuing to improve the quality of learning interactions between teachers and children</li>
<li>more closely aligning programme planning, assessment and evaluation to <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>improving self review.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation-to-other-agencies" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation to other agencies</h2><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education provides support to help the centre develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><a id="5-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must ensure that:</p><ul>
