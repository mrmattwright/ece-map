</table><p>Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre require significant support to develop clear understandings of effective governance, management and leadership roles and responsibilities.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre is located in Hawera and caters for children aged from six months to five years. It is an all-day centre licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 aged under two years. At the time of this review there were 70 children enrolled, including 12 MƒÅori.</p><p>The centre is a non-profit community-based service governed by a parent committee. The teaching team comprises nine qualified teachers, including one who is provisionally registered. Four staff are in training.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environment provides opportunities for exploration and collaborative play for infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>Since the July 2013 ERO review a new centre manager has been appointed. She is also the team leader for the Tui room which caters for older children. A new team leader in the Kea and Morepork rooms, for infants and toddlers, has also been appointed.</p><p>Priorities for improvement identified in the previous ERO review have yet to be sufficiently addressed. These include developing high quality strategic review, evaluating the impact of teaching strategies on children's learning, strengthening the links between strategic and annual plans, fully implementing the revised appraisal system and aligning teachers goals to centre-wide professional development. Policies and procedures to do with employment practices also required updating. These remain a priority.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are engaged and active in their learning. Nurturing and caring relationships are well established. Children are well supported to make decisions about their learning. These respectful interactions positively contribute to the individual child's strong sense of belonging. A well-considered approach to supporting children with additional needs is evident.</p><p>Children's interests are supported through provision of a wide range of activities and excursions. Teachers promote their curiosity in the learning environment and encourage them to take risks through play-based experiences. Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments.</p><p>The team has recently reviewed and amended the philosophy. This should now be reviewed in consultation with parents' and whƒÅnau to ensure it reflects the centre community. When this process is complete next steps are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>collectively determine what best practice looks like for the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formulate indicators of good practice which will be useful in informing internal evaluation, future decisions, appointments and teacher appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of tikanga MƒÅori were observed by ERO. Some adults use te reo MƒÅori when working with children. Leaders have identified that enacting their expressed commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand is an area that requires further development. Promoting educational success for MƒÅori is yet to be explored by the service.</p><p>A collaborative culture is evident across the teaching team. Staff regularly share and discuss children's emerging interests and consider how they can deepen their learning. Assessment documentation shows how teachers support and respond to children's emerging interests. As recent changes to planning and assessment embed, a more consistent approach is developing.</p><p>Establishing a strategic direction for the centre is a priority. This was identified in ERO's 2013 report and limited progress has been made. Next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building and enhancing systems and processes so they align with the strategic direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an annual plan to guide the centre's operation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager, through external support, has recently implemented the appraisal process for teachers. The system requires further strengthening to meet current best practice expectations. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal practices in an annual cycle linked to professional development and the provision for ongoing coaching or mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making expectations explicit through performance indicators linked to job descriptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly observing teaching practice to support development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing evidence-based teaching portfolios linked to the Practising Teacher Criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appropriately endorsing teacher's practising certificates for issue or renewal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is timely to review the centre's policies and procedures to ensure they have sufficient depth to guide practice, reflect licensing criteria and incorporate recent changes to legislation.</p><p>In 2015, the centre initiated a new approach to self review. Teachers are now more skilled at researching and exploring theory in relation to their practice. Developing understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool for measuring the quality and effectiveness of practices should promote better outcomes for children.</p><p>The parent committee, which operates as a governing body, does not have position descriptions or clearly stated expectations of their roles and responsibilities. This is a priority area for development. In addition, stronger leadership is required to effectively guide centre operations and lead internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent committee and manager need support to strengthen curriculum, governance and management. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing a culturally responsive curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing robust systems and processes that promote sustainability, including appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of governance and management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building the capability of the leader to effectively guide centre operations and internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and governance and management practices. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the curriculum acknowledges and reflects the unique place of MƒÅori as tangata whenua</p>
</li>
</ul><p>and that children are given the opportunity to develop knowledge and an understanding of the cultural heritages of both parties to <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em></p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement a system of regular staff appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an annual plan to guide service operation.<em>(Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, R47 1(a), C5, GMA7, GMA8)</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to¬†</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
