</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Victoria University Wellington Clermont Terrace Early Childhood Service is one of two communitybased centres situated near Victoria University‚Äôs Kelburn campus. The service provides education and care for children aged 3 months to 5 years in two adjacent houses and caters for children of university staff and postgraduate students. Although the amalgamation of Tui House and Kea House under one licence occurred in early 2013, families continue to have a choice of which house they would like their child to attend.</p><p>Victoria University Early Childhood Services is responsible for governance of the service and in early 2013 appointed a new manager of early childhood services. In mid 2013, a senior management team carried out a rigorous review that investigated ways to ensure the service remained viable while offering a high quality service that is responsive to families‚Äô needs.</p><p>The centre manager and head of complex work collaboratively to oversee the provision for infants, toddlers and young children and initiatives to assist families as partners in teaching and learning. Draft strategic plan goals focus on teaching and learning and centre operations. These objectives have the potential to improve outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are busy, purposeful, active learners. Teachers increasingly foster and encourage emerging interests, and support child-led inquiries and investigations. Early literacy and numeracy experiences are integrated meaningfully throughout the programmes. Children are developing skills that support them as capable, confident lifelong learners. Learning and development are celebrated and shared between teachers and parents in informative portfolios. Teachers‚Äô focus is on further developing close partnerships between homes and the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers develop trusting relationships with key teachers. They form close connections with these adults. Children‚Äôs sense of belonging is enhanced through positive interaction with caring adults who know them and their families well. The centre‚Äôs youngest children are effectively catered for by adults who enthusiastically encourage developing verbal and expressive language and recognise their cues and wishes. Infants and toddlers actively explore the appropriate range of play equipment and activities available.</p><p>Teachers work successfully in providing an environment that acknowledges New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage, and the cultures of the children attending, through the provision of some resources and encouragement of basic use of te reo MƒÅori. Teachers should continue to build their confidence, knowledge and understanding of implementing a bicultural programme.</p><p>The head of complex has high expectations of teachers and has a sound knowledge of best practice in early childhood. Staff reflect on the impact of what they do to promote positive outcomes for children. They have opportunities to access professional learning and development to enhance their own professional growth.</p><p>Centre leaders demonstrate a strong focus on improvement. Since the restructuring of the service, work has begun to refine and develop sound systems, policies and procedures, ensuring that processes are consistent and well aligned within teams. Collegial relationships are a priority, and teachers are purposefully involved in professional learning and development that is focused on team building, with an external facilitator.</p><p>Leaders use evidence systematically to review processes and practices, to reflect on the quality of teaching and learning and to guide planning. Annual goals and action plans are firmly based on promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service philosophy has not been reviewed recently. This review should occur to ensure parents' aspirations and agreed teaching practice underpins the centre philosophy and determines curriculum priorities and emphases. Developing a shared philosophy for teachers of the service‚Äôs youngest children should be a further consideration for teachers.</p><p>Leaders should continue to develop capacity for evaluation and self review to promote teachers' inquiry into the impact of teaching practice on outcomes for children by:</p><ul>
<li>enhancing understanding of effective teaching practice and developing consistency through clear expectations for teaching and learning</li>
<li>strengthening the appraisal system</li>
<li>implementing programmes for provisionally registered teachers to support their developing competence</li>
<li>implementing the draft strategic plan.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Victoria University of Wellington Clermont Terrace Early Childhood Services completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Victoria University of Wellington Clermont Terrace Early Childhood Services will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 April 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
