</table><p>Beginnings Early Learning Centre¬†is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beginnings Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre on Waiheke Island, Auckland. The centre is organised into two main areas to cater for children up to the age of two, and those between two years and school age. The roll includes a group of MƒÅori children, and small numbers with diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>A new centre manager leads a team of long-serving qualified teachers. The centre has a philosophical focus on whanaungatanga, connectedness and belonging in the Waiheke community.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report, the environment for infants and toddlers has been updated, and there has been progress toward using internal evaluation for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and relaxed in the programme. They demonstrate confidence and curiosity, and are articulate communicators. Children engage very actively and enjoy sustained play and learning.</p><p>Respectful relationships are evident in the centre. Teachers recognise the importance of building responsive connections with children and their families.</p><p>Younger children enjoy a calm and gentle environment. They receive very good quality care with supportive individualised attention from adults who know them well. A low fence that separates the older and younger children's outside areas allows some communication and connection between groups.</p><p>Transitions and routines within the centre are unhurried. These aspects encourage children to engage in longer periods of play. Teachers could now look carefully at embedding more intentional teaching strategies for the mixed-age group in the over two area.</p><p>The centre manager has led recent positive developments. These include introducing new planning approaches and aspects of science concepts and the natural environment, to reflect and capture the local context. Another priority is a deliberate focus on children‚Äôs individual strengths and interests. These initiatives should enable teachers to better align their planning with their assessment of children's learning and development.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop bicultural practices. The centre manager intends to provide support for teachers to learn and include te reo MƒÅori and tikanga MƒÅori in the centre programme.</p><p>The manager has begun to build a collaborative, professional team to support greater shared ownership of decisions. Extending approaches to teachers' appraisal should increase collective capacity across the centre. There is a good policy framework to guide centre operations and ensure health and safety requirements are met.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used to identify areas for improvement. Leaders and teachers are currently reviewing the centre philosophy. A priority for teachers is to use evaluation to identify ways to include parent aspirations and a commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and centre manager recognise that key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement intentional teaching strategies for the mixed-age group of children over the age of two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly align planned teaching strategies with assessment of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the learning environment to support more complex play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Beginnings Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>10 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>
