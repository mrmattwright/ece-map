</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gate Pa Preschool is a privately owned, newly established centre located in Gate Pa Tauranga. It is licensed for 30 children, including 10 aged under two years. At the time of this ERO review, the centre had been in operation for two years, and there were 30 children on the roll, including four who identify as MƒÅori.</p><p>Children learn and play in a homelike and stimulating environment that provides infants, toddlers and young children with rich opportunities to explore and investigate their world. The centre manager and teachers actively welcome and support children and their families who come from diverse backgrounds. A significant feature of the centre is the way in which staff respond effectively to children with complex educational needs.</p><p>The centre has a highly committed and competent teaching team who ensure that the needs of all children and their families are well catered for. The knowledgeable and experienced centre manager has been in the process of employing two new teachers after the departure of two staff members at the end of 2014.</p><p>The centre philosophy believes in building children‚Äôs sense of respect for themselves, their peers, whƒÅnau and community, and their environment. Caring and respectful relationships are at the heart of all centre interactions.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner/manager, supported by her team, has established highly effective systems and processes that guide and support all centre operations including financial management. The service‚Äôs philosophy underpins centre values and beliefs, and reflects a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Self review is effective in promoting ongoing centre improvement.</p><p>Centre staff place the well being of children, parents and whƒÅnau at the heart of all centre interactions, activities and events. They have developed an inclusive culture in which children from diverse backgrounds are lovingly cared for, accepted, and have a strong sense of belonging. A working strategic and annual plan provides clear direction for policy review, centre operations and management.</p><p>The centre manager models effective teaching practice and provides ongoing professional development for teachers. She encourages staff to use their initiative and take on leadership roles. She also recognises and acknowledges the skills and experiences of parents/whƒÅnau and the wider community, and invites them to contribute to children‚Äôs experiences. A particular strength of the centre leaders is their knowledge and skills in managing children with high learning needs.</p><p>The curriculum emerges from children‚Äôs ideas, interests and the contribution from teachers and whƒÅnau. The learning environment is rich and stimulating, providing opportunities for exploration, problem solving, experimentation, creativity and risk taking. Activities are presented attractively to invite infants, toddlers and young children into play. Te Ao MƒÅori is well integrated across the curriculum and teachers are exploring local historical contexts and events, and the surrounding natural environment, to enhance further learning opportunities for children.</p><p>There are very effective systems and processes that support children‚Äôs assessment and teacher planning. The centre manager identified through self review that a next step is to focus more on the recording of children‚Äôs progress and development over time. The experienced and knowledgeable teaching team continue to enhance their professional practice through professional learning and development, good quality reflection and evaluation, and effective communication.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be independent and take responsibility for leading their learning and play. Teachers follow children into play and enter into their imaginary world. They listen to children and support them in sustaining their play and revisiting their learning. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into children‚Äôs play throughout the indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers encourage and support children to use their words and non-verbal skills to resolve problems, find solutions, and negotiate outcomes. Children are confident communicators who willingly engage in conversations with adults, each other and visitors to the centre.</p><p>Children are nurtured in their transitions within the centre as well as onto school. Infants and toddlers enjoy tuakana/teina relationships and have the opportunity to learn in a quiet, low-stress environment. They receive nurturing and comfort from adults who are sensitive to children‚Äôs rhythms and needs. Children demonstrate caring relationships with each other and especially with children who have high needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for centre staff are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>use self review to enhance their practice</li>
<li>maintain high trust relationships within an effective learning community.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gate Pa Preshool and Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‚Äòhave‚Äô or ‚Äòhave not‚Äô taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gate Pa Preshool and Childcare will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 March 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
