</table><p><br> Systems and practices at Little Wonders Childcare (Aoraki) are not yet effective and require further development. The owner also needs to provide greater support for the centre leadership.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Childcare (Aoraki) is a new purpose-built education and care centre in Timaru. It opened in August 2013 and is one of eight Little Wonders centres in New Zealand.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for up to 100 children aged from birth to school-age. It has had a large growth in its roll recently. Families can choose whole-day, school-day, or half-day attendance. The children play and learn in five different rooms according to their ages. The centre provides meals for the children.</p><p>Since opening there have been significant staff changes at the centre. There have also been changes in the leadership team. A range of experienced and beginning teachers are employed. The acting manager has been in her role since February 2015.</p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children have warm and caring relationships with their teachers. They are familiar with the routines at the centre, and establish good friendships. Teachers have a variety of ways to communicate with parents about their children’s care, interests, and learning. There are planned transitions for children into the centre and between rooms. </p><p>The children benefit from a range of worthwhile learning experiences including baking, gardening, and excursions for the older children. Recent professional development has led the teachers to place a greater focus on planning for individual children. The profile books are an attractive record of the children’s experiences at the centre and comment on their learning and individual goals. </p><p>The teachers are continuing to develop their planning and assessment practices. However, the many changes in staff have made it difficult to establish common understandings about the centre’s philosophy and approaches to learning and teaching.</p><p>Children and teachers use te reo Māori in the course of the day and te reo Māori is well represented in wall displays. The teachers have identified that a next step is to bring more Māori perspectives into the programme. </p><p>Teachers in the infants and toddler rooms have close, responsive interactions with the children. They maintain a calm and unhurried pace, and give the children time and space to make choices for themselves. The teachers provide a wide range of sensory learning experiences for infants and toddlers. </p><p>The owner provides a policy framework to guide the centre operations. The systems in place are not robust and comprehensive enough to confirm for the owner:</p><ul>
<li>whether or not the centre is meetings its legal requirements</li>
<li>how well it is providing for the children’s education and care.</li>
</ul><p>The leaders and teachers have started to develop a long-term plan for the centre that identifies priorities for teaching and learning. They have allocated responsibility to particular teachers to lead these developments. While there is a network for the leaders of the eight Little Wonders centres to meet and provide mutual support, the acting manager has not been well supported in her role within the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve outcomes for children the owner must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>there is better information about the operations of the centre and provide greater support for the centre leaders</li>
<li>there are effective systems in place for monitoring the operations of the centre and building improvements in understanding and practice</li>
<li>that the next steps in this report are addressed.</li>
</ul><p><em>Philosophy and shared expectations</em></p><p>Leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>review the centre philosophy with current staff to ensure they have common understandings</li>
<li>find ways to ensure effective communication and reporting within the centre in order to ensure centre-wide consistency.</li>
</ul><p><em>Long term planning</em></p><p>The owner, leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>further develop the centre’s long-term plan with associated goals towards achieving its vision</li>
<li>monitor progress towards the goals in a systematic way</li>
<li>align other processes in the centre (such as appraisal, planning and assessment, self review, professional development, and communication systems) to the priorities in the plan.</li>
</ul><p><em>Self review</em></p><p>Leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared understanding of effective self review</li>
<li>implement a schedule for planned review to ensure all aspects of centre operations are reviewed over time.</li>
</ul><p><em>Māori perspectives</em></p><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to build Māori perspectives in the programme.</p><p><em> Planning, assessment &amp; evaluation</em></p><p>Leaders and teachers need to develop a shared understanding of curriculum priorities for children’s learning. They should continue to develop a consistent approach to planning, assessment and evaluation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>documenting what the intended learning is, the strategies and experiences they provide and the difference they have made to children’s learning</li>
<li>showing how they respond to parents’ wishes for their children’s learning</li>
<li>showing children’s progress over time</li>
<li>evaluating how well the programmes and teaching strategies are supporting children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Childcare (Aoraki) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>fire and earthquake drills are held with adequate frequency and recorded</li>
<li>more rigorous management plans for dealing with possible risks on excursions are put in place</li>
<li>there is a robust system for ensuring that heavy furniture and equipment are secured.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><p>Implementation of effective processes for human resource management, including:</p><ul>
<li>induction procedures for new staff</li>
<li>a system of regular appraisal</li>
<li>advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>a system to ensure police vetting is up to date</li>
<li>support for centre leadership.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Childcare (Aoraki) will be within two years. </p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>21 August 2015 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
