</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Kidd Inn Too in Glen Eden, Auckland provides for up to 35 children including 15 up to two years of age. The centre is one of three that are privately owned by an experienced early childhood educator. The centre operates in a modified house where children play and learn together in two age related groups. A calm, natural aesthetic quality exists throughout the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has been influenced by a range of educational theorists. Teachers have extracted key elements from these teachings to define approaches and programmes that are particularly appropriate for children in their care. The 'natural phenomena' movement, that emphasises a commitment to children interacting with nature on a daily basis, is an important component.</p><p>Children are valued as capable and competent individuals who contribute to each other's learning and development. All teachers are fully registered and work together as a highly professional team. Trusting and supportive relationships are sustained between teachers and parents.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted effective leadership, positive learning relationships between children and teachers, and that children highly engaged in their play. These features continue to be evident. Extending children's thinking, and promoting greater success for Māori as Māori were identified for development in the 2013 report. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. The calm and purposeful tone supports children to be relaxed and set their own pace. Children are very settled and well engaged in a range of play opportunities that match the centre's philosophy. Children form close friendships. They play cooperatively and respectfully together from a young age.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are warm and respectful. Children are confident and articulate in communicating their ideas and needs to teachers and with their peers. Children trust teachers to be responsive and to encourage them in their learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for and nurtured. They form warm bonds with teachers and especially with their primary care giver. The uncluttered play areas for infants and toddlers support their development and exploration well. Teachers and parents communicate informally and in writing to ensure the details of the young child's day are shared.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well included in the centre. Teachers are kept well informed about how they can best support the children. The centre works closely with external agencies to promote learning and development for these children.</p><p>While children mostly direct their own play, they also benefit from teacher planned events and objects that are designed to promote and extend thinking and play. Teachers act as facilitators of children's learning by observing, waiting and listening before they involve themselves in children's play. This good practice respects children as capable learners, and ensures teachers understand the purpose of the play before they become involved.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively for learning opportunities and provocations that support and extend children's interests. Teachers have strengthened their use of te reo Māori. Children are familiar and confident with the aspects of tikanga Māori that teachers incorporate into the programmes.</p><p>An 'Extended Programme Time' provides four year olds with further opportunities to learn as a group and from each other. This group of older children take weekly excursions to a wide variety of natural environments. Children benefit from these occasions as they provide additional motivation and experiences from which to learn. Revisiting favourite excursion places builds children's confidence and encourages exploration and creative play.</p><p>Teachers record children's learning and development in online portfolios. Parents add comments and stories from home that contribute to what teachers know about the children. This practice is encouraging parents to support their children's learning at home and in the centre.</p><p>The centre owner and head teachers provide effective leadership. Their high expectations of care for children and of the enactment of the centre's philosophy are shared and understood by teachers. Professional learning and development is matched to teachers' specific interests and to increasing learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers use a comprehensive internal evaluation process to support ongoing improvement. They inquire into the effectiveness of important aspects of their work. Teachers critique their practices and are open to different ways of working. Leaders ensure that current research and thinking in early childhood education are considered during this process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO consider that key next steps for centre improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining appraisal policy documentation so that it better reflects the good practice already in place to support teachers to reflect on and extend their practice</p>
</li>
<li>continuing to build centre practices that acknowledge Māori as tangata whenua and New Zealand as a bicultural nation. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Kid Inn Too Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Just Kid Inn Too Ltd will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 September 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
