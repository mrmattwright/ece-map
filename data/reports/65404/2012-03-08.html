The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc caters for children between six months and five years of age.

Parents are enthusiastic in their support for the centre.

Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atGolden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The June 2008 ERO report stated that the centre provided high quality education and care, meeting the needs of families from the wider Golden Bay area. Its effective teaching practices and positive adult/child interactions supported learning. Since then staffing has remained stable and teachers have worked to maintain the quality of their service. Changes have been made to the outdoor environment to enhance its appeal to children and encourage exploration and play.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Programme</em></p><p>Programme planning is of high quality. Teachers have a consistent and well defined approach to planning that clearly demonstrates how teachers reflect on and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging and developing interests. Wide-ranging contexts, including strong links to the community are used to promote children&rsquo;s learning, well-being, belonging and sense of identity.</p><p>Children play for sustained periods both independently, and in groups of their own choosing. Routines are familiar and well understood.</p><p><em>Environment</em></p><p>The learning environment strongly reflects the community&rsquo;s interests and aspirations with its focus on conservation. The centre ethos promotes care and protection of the natural environment and of living things.</p><p>Children are calm and settled. They freely make choices about their play from a wide range of resources designed to encourage their exploration and creativity. They engage in dramatic play and experiment with different roles.</p><p><em>Interactions </em></p><p>Adults are warm and friendly in their interactions with children. Teachers know the children well, respectfully support individuals through their challenges and promote their ability to participate confidently in centre activities. They respond to children&rsquo;s communication with curiosity, interest and attention. Te reo M&#257;ori is naturally incorporated into conversations and respect for te ao M&#257;ori is evident.</p><p>Staff relationships are positive. They work collaboratively to maximise learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Children are responsive and cooperative as they participate in both free play and in more structured activities. They are encouraged to care for each other and support their playmates.</p><p><em>Parent Partnerships </em></p><p>Good communication promotes strong parent and community partnerships. Parents are enthusiastic in their support for the centre. Events involving various wh&#257;nau members scheduled throughout the year contribute to the community&rsquo;s sense of belonging.</p><p><em>Transitions </em></p><p>Smooth transitions into, through and beyond the centre are the result of careful consideration by staff. Each child&rsquo;s needs are catered for flexibly and many transitions are celebrated as children progress through the centre.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Self review</em></p><p>While self review has been used to effectively strengthen programme planning, continuing to deepen shared understandings of self review is likely to enhance the quality of centre practices. Staff have a useful self-review framework. Developing robust evaluative questions and indicators of success would assist the review process.</p><p><em>Appraisal</em></p><p>ERO identified and management agrees that it is timely to undertake a review of appraisal processes. Formal observation of teaching practice has not been part of recent appraisal.</p><p><em>Learning stories</em></p><p>Next steps in learning stories frequently describe how teachers will keep supporting children. There is scope for these assessments to record how children&rsquo;s learning might be extended.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service, centre staff demonstrate effective communication with families and provide a positive and responsive approach to the needs of individuals. The centre approaches support agencies when appropriate.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4.&nbsp;Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified an area where personnel practices could be improved. While there are a policy and templates to guide performance appraisal, these are in need of review to ensure that they enable all aspects of the process to be adequately documented.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-golden-kids-early-learning-centre-inc" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc.</p><p>Golden Kids Early Learning Centre Inc caters for children between six months and five years of age. The June 2008 ERO report stated that the centre provided high quality education and care. Its effective teaching practices and positive adult/child interactions supported learning. Since then staffing has remained stable. They have worked successfully to maintain the quality of their service.</p><p>Positive changes have been made to the outdoor environment to enhance its appeal for children and encourage exploration. This attractive play space reflects the community&rsquo;s interests and aspirations with its focus on conservation. The centre ethos promotes care and protection of the natural environment and of living things.</p><p>Programme planning is of high quality. Teachers have a consistent and well defined approach that clearly demonstrates how they reflect on and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging and developing interests. Wide-ranging contexts, including strong links to the community are used to promote children&rsquo;s learning, well-being, belonging and sense of identity. Children are calm and settled. They freely make choices about their play from a wide range of resources designed to encourage their exploration and creativity.</p><p>Adults are warm and friendly in their interactions with children. Teachers know the children well, respectfully support individuals through their challenges and promote their ability to participate confidently in centre activities. They respond to children&rsquo;s communication with curiosity, interest and attention. Te reo M&#257;ori is naturally incorporated into conversations and respect for te ao M&#257;ori is evident.</p><p>Smooth transitions into, through and beyond the centre are the result of careful consideration by staff. Each child&rsquo;s needs are catered for flexibly. Children are responsive and cooperative as they participate in both free play and in more structured activities. Children are encouraged to care for each other and support their playmates.</p><p>Good communication promotes strong parent and community partnerships. Parents are enthusiastic in their support for the centre. Events involving various wh&#257;nau members are scheduled throughout the year.</p><p>Next steps for development include reviewing appraisal processes and continuing to strengthen self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
