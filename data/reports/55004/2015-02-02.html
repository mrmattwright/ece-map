</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Gisborne Community Education Centre Te Whare Tiaki Tamariki is a community based early childhood service located in the central business district of Gisborne. The centre is licensed for up to 45 children including 15 under two-year-olds. Full time care and education is offered in areas designed to suit the developmental stages of infants, toddlers and young children. Many children attend the centre part time. Over a third of the roll identify as MƒÅori.</p>
<p>An executive management committee governs the centre. The manager (Tumuaki) works closely with committee members and reports about the centre programme. Most of the teachers are qualified in early childhood education and one is in training. There is a strong commitment to ensuring there is a high ratio of qualified teachers to children. The centre has had a positive reporting history with ERO.</p>
<p>The teaching philosophy advocates viewing children as confident and competent learners, acknowledging and celebrating their individuality and working in partnership with parents.</p>
<p>The centre currently has a transitional licence. Renovations to the premises are required to ensure facilities for washing children are adequate. The committee is currently exploring renovation options.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children participate in a child-centred, play-based programme. There are many opportunities for them to learn about science and literacy in the well-resourced environment. Teachers work alongside children as they engage in their play and learning. They use a range of effective teaching strategies to extend their thinking, understanding and development of skills. The well-considered environment fosters children‚Äôs exploration and curiosity.</p>
<p>Mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting learning opportunities and children make use of open-ended resources to explore concepts. A next step is for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of the mathematics programme within the curriculum.</p>
<p>Responsive and respectful relationships are a key feature of this centre. Each child is valued as a unique learner. Teachers listen to children and engage them in conversations about things of interest to the child. Rich, descriptive conversations support language development. Teachers capitalise appropriately on opportunities that arise to support children‚Äôs developing social and emotional competence. The philosophy is evident in the programme and teaching practice.</p>
<p>Teachers are committed to providing a bicultural programme. Te reo and aspects of tikanga MƒÅori are incorporated throughout the curriculum in meaningful ways. A wide range of well-considered strategies is implemented at all levels to promote success for MƒÅori as MƒÅori.</p>
<p>Partnership with parents is highly evident. Their involvement is encouraged at governance and centre level. Regular, useful information is made available to parents about centre activities and how children learn and develop.</p>
<p>Transitions are very well managed. Self review has assisted to inform this process. Clear policies provide overall guidance for teachers as children transition into the centre, between rooms and on to school.</p>
<p>A spacious and separate area for children up to two years of age allows for quiet care, individual exploration and free physical movement. The Pikler philosophy strongly influences the approach taken in this area. Routines are unhurried and interactions are calm and responsive. Teachers are attuned to infants‚Äô and toddlers‚Äô non-verbal cues. Care times are promoted as learning times and children have a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Assessment documentation builds children‚Äôs identity as successful learners. Continuity of learning experiences assists in highlighting the child‚Äôs progress over time. Teachers should continue to strengthen this practice by integrating parents‚Äô aspirations and celebrating children‚Äôs cultural diversity through the documentation.</p>
<p>The annual plan is well considered and provides a clear strategic direction. A systematic process of self review is evident. This approach is improvement focused, informed by research and considers multiple perspectives. Teachers have identified that more systematic documentation which evaluates the impact of the focus under review would strengthen this approach.</p>
<p>Appraisal is robust and improvement focused. Appropriate and targeted professional development is undertaken by teachers. Strong professional leadership is provided by the manager. She works closely with teachers to support them to embed professional learning. Leadership opportunities are also promoted throughout the centre.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The manager and leaders agree the next steps for improvement are to:</p>
<ul><li>strengthen self review and evaluation</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the mathematics curriculum</li>
<li>continue to develop assessment and planning processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gisborne Community Early Education Centre Te Whare Tiaki Tamariki Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Actions for compliance</h3>
<p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. The service provider must ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>the manager is regularly appraised¬†<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 GMA7</em>]</li>
<li>police vetting of non-registered staff is undertaken.¬†<em>[The Education Act 1989, section 78C]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of Gisborne Community Early Education Centre Te Whare Tiaki Tamariki Inc will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
