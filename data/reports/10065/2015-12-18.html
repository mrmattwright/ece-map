</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuatara Preschool has served the Browns Bay community in Auckland for over 20 years. Since the 2012 ERO review, the preschool has been relicensed under the 2008 licensing criteria. It now provides education and care for up to 40 children from two years to school age. The roll is over 60 percent PƒÅkehƒÅ and nearly 20 percent Asian.</p><p>The preschool consists of one large building that is split into distinct areas of play, some separate rooms for quieter individual and group activities, and a kitchen. All children play together but the younger and older ones are sometimes separated for special programmes.</p><p>The current staff to child ratio is better than minimum requirements. The staff comprise four qualified teachers, one unqualified teacher, a teachers‚Äô aide and a cook. One of the teachers has full teacher registration.</p><p>The preschool‚Äôs philosophy reflects the principles of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It notes the importance of creating an environment that helps maximise children‚Äôs engagement in their learning. ERO‚Äôs 2012 report on the centre noted strengths in the implementation of this philosophy and in the partnership being developed with parents and whƒÅnau. These strengths remain, and staff continue to make progress in addressing areas for improvement identified in the 2012 report.</p><p>The preschool has undergone significant change over the past year. It has a new manager, who was previously a teacher at the preschool, and it has a new owner/service provider, the Evolve Education Group 3. Evolve provides the centre with business management and professional management support with policy and procedures.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle well into the preschool. They are all welcomed, valued and included in the programme. They enjoy each other‚Äôs company and have well established friendships. Children approach teachers with confidence, and receive good levels of adult interactions and attention. They are well cared for and benefit from the centre‚Äôs homely environment. Attractive displays celebrate children‚Äôs learning experiences and acknowledge their participation in the programme.</p><p>Children show their independence and interest in learning as they play and explore activities that interest them. Much of the equipment is freely accessible, and additional resources are well labelled and displayed to promote further child choice. New weatherproofing screens have extended times when children can play comfortably in the large patio area. The top outdoor playground has been re-turfed and improved, and a ‚Äúwild‚Äù garden developed. All of these positive developments enhance learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The programme includes a good amount of time for children to engage in play. During these times children develop their oral language, and their early literacy, numeracy and science skills and understandings. Such play-based learning is the foundation of the early childhood curriculum. In developing the programme, teachers have also focussed on strengthening their bicultural understandings and practices. They are becoming more confident in helping children to develop early appreciation of New Zealand‚Äôs dual cultural heritage. Projects around celebrations and community events help ensure that Auckland‚Äôs multicultural makeup is also acknowledged.</p><p>Assessment portfolios are well presented records of children‚Äôs participation in varied learning experiences. The portfolios are now available digitally, enabling busy parents to participate in a more active partnership in their child‚Äôs learning. The portfolios include rich information to help parents understand the purposes of centre activities, and they capture children‚Äôs voices and opinions well. Teachers could now use learning stories about individual children more, to identify their interests and consider how these might be extended. They could then use this knowledge as the basis for their programme planning.</p><p>The preschool manager has effectively led staff and parents through a period of ongoing change. She has collaborated well with Evolve personnel to adapt management systems to meet new expectations. Evolve‚Äôs professional support manager has high expectations for the health and safety provision for children and adults. She also provides a professional development role, especially for provisionally registered teachers. Both the preschool‚Äôs management and its service providers demonstrate the capacity to guide ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>During the review process preschool leaders and ERO agreed that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the quality and challenge of learning opportunities, especially those provided in the outdoors</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the preschool‚Äôs bicultural practices</li>
<li>improving the way teachers use assessment of children‚Äôs learning to plan more individualised programmes</li>
<li>focusing programme evaluations more directly on the quality of children‚Äôs learning experiences</li>
<li>continuing to help parents appreciate the value of play-based early childhood education and how it supports children‚Äôs transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuatara Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tuatara Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
