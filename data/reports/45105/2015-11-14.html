</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Bear Park Centre of Learning is located in Remuera, Auckland, and provides full day education and care for children from three months to five years of age. The centre is licensed for 90 children, including 35 up to the age of two years.</p>
<p>The vision for the centre incorporates <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the philosophy and approaches of Reggio Emilia. Teachers place a strong focus on children‚Äôs creativity as part of their holistic development. The specifically designed centre is an architectural expression of this vision. Facilities for learning include a central piazza, three atelier rooms for specialist art, and a performing arts studio.</p>
<p>The centre is privately owned and the premises also act as the head office for the Bear Park franchised group of services in Auckland and Dunedin. From here, centralised policies and systems, together with a support and guidance team, promote levels of consistency across the Bear Park brand.</p>
<p>The centre manager oversees and guides the day-to-day operations in collaboration with the centre director and teachers. A specialist art teacher supports teachers in the learning environment and fosters creative approaches requested by children in many different learning contexts.</p>
<p>Children play and learn in age-related areas, each with an adjoining outdoor playground. Infants and toddlers benefit from primary care and generous teacher to child ratios. Transitions into, within and out of the centre are carefully and effectively managed by centre staff.</p>
<p>The 2011 ERO report suggested that centre leaders continue to focus on planning for individual children‚Äôs learning, review strategic and annual planning, and include more measurable goals for teacher development within their annual appraisal processes. All of these matters have been addressed.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>High levels of respect for children underpin the professional practice in this centre. The pace of learning is appropriate and relevant for each child. Children learn to value the natural global environment and see themselves as part of it. The creative influences of the Reggio Emilia approach are clearly evident in the child-centred programmes. Children‚Äôs complex conversations about their interests and discoveries add many layers to their understanding of the wider world.</p>
<p>Children display a thirst for knowledge and often plan their own learning directions. Literacy, mathematics, science and nature are all woven through programmes that encourage curiosity and wonderment. At a deeper level, children learn important social competencies and negotiation skills as they play and work together.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed genuine learning partnerships with families. Programmes clearly reflect what teachers know about children. A strategic parent group meets regularly to add the parent voice to centre planning. The centre uses communication technologies to encourage parent access to children‚Äôs learning and to encourage their feedback.</p>
<p>Teachers understand their professional role as early childhood educators. Processes for reflecting on and evaluating their work with children are well documented and support the achievement of planned outcomes. Infants and toddlers are respectfully cared for in a restful environment that has the ambience of home. Their teachers are highly attuned to their needs and are sensitive and caring.</p>
<p>Staff manage children‚Äôs transitions in carefully considered ways. Parents have frequent opportunities to be a part of this process. Gentle settling times help children to bond with teachers and feel a sense of belonging in the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers are gaining more confidence with bicultural components in their programmes. The centre promotes a monthly focus on MƒÅori-based values. Although few MƒÅori children attend the centre, teachers recognise the importance of all children learning to understand and share in New Zealand‚Äôs bicultural heritage. Teachers and children enjoy important celebrations for MƒÅori and for families from other cultures.</p>
<p>Centre leaders invest generously in the professionalism of centre staff. Teachers are trained as lifelong learners. They receive regular professional learning opportunities and a specialist team guides the development of teaching practices.</p>
<p>Governance and management of the centre is coherent and transparent. Centre leaders foster a high trust model and focus on growing their leadership from within the centre. A positive, energised work culture results from this approach.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>In discussions with ERO, centre leaders identified a focus on continuing to:</p>
<ul><li>strengthen the bicultural focus and encourage teachers to be more confident in the use of te reo MƒÅori</li>
<li>use well developed self-review processes to further enrich centre programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Centre of Learning completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Centre of Learning will be in four years.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO‚Äôs overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‚ÄòHow well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?‚Äô ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">NgƒÅ Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou ƒÄrahi</em> ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>MƒÅtauranga</em> ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
