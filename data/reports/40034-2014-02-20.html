</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group is community owned and located at Lake Okareka which is east of Rotorua city. The centre is licensed for 25 children over two years of age. At the time of this ERO review the roll was 24 and includes two children of MƒÅori descent. The centre is sessional, in the mornings Monday to Friday, with three extended sessions each week for older children.</p><p>The centre‚Äôs philosophy aims to provide a holistic learning environment that values young children, acknowledging and promoting parents, whƒÅnau and caregivers as contributors integral to their children‚Äôs education. Since the 2011 ERO review the preschool has changed its management structure from a committee management model to a board governance model. This has included redefined job descriptions for board members and staff. There are three qualified and experienced teachers including the centre manager. They work collaboratively with board members to make decisions and manage the centre.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to strengthening aspects of self review indentified in ERO‚Äôs 2011 report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A significant strength of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group is the involvement of, and contribution, by parents and whƒÅnau. The newly formed board, made up of parent representatives, is providing effective governance of the centre. These members contribute relevant skills, knowledge and experience to their governance roles. Opportunities for training in relation to early childhood education services, including the performance management of teachers, are needed. This should assist board members to deepen their understanding of personnel management and the governance of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group.</p><p>There is a collaborative and shared approach to leadership in this centre. Teachers and parents are encouraged to share their strengths and talents to enrich the curriculum and promote positive learning outcomes for children. Effective processes for self review, focused on improving outcomes for children are developed. The teaching team has successfully established relationships based on respect and trust with each other, parents, whƒÅnau and children. They are now focused on providing more opportunities for families to share their goals and aspirations about their children‚Äôs learning and development.</p><p>Children benefit from extensive opportunities to engage in interesting projects and sustained play and exploration. There is a strong emphasis on fostering independence, social skills and promoting children‚Äôs interest in literacy, mathematics, the sciences and arts. Teachers understand and value children‚Äôs play as real work and learning.</p><p>Teachers have a good knowledge of children‚Äôs interests and learning needs, and this information is used to plan responsive programmes and learning experiences. Children use their imagination and creativity during a wide range of self-directed learning experiences. Teachers provide a wide range of high-quality resources and materials that motivate and challenge children.</p><p>A feature of the learning environment is the way that teachers listen and respond to the language, culture and identities of all children and their families/whƒÅnau. Teachers use te reo MƒÅori throughout the programme and are committed to strengthening Te Ao MƒÅori perspectives within the learning environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, centre management and teachers agree to improve:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for families/whƒÅnau to share their goals and aspirations about their children‚Äôs learning and development</li>
<li>performance management of teachers through more specific goal setting, deeper reflection on teaching and links to current research and best practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lake Okareka Preschool Education Group will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
