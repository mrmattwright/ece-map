</table><p>Systems to support sustained good practice and improvement of outcomes for children require strengthening. Some key aspects of operation are not sufficiently developed.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Marlborough St Childcare Centre is a community-based, all-day early learning service located in Silverstream, Upper Hutt. It is licensed for 30 children including 15 aged up to two years. Of the 35 children enrolled, two are MƒÅori. The centre has a long-term, well-demonstrated commitment to working with children that require additional learning support.</p><p>A trust board has oversight of operation. A committee made up of parents has management responsibility, works in collaboration with the head teacher and reports to the board.</p><p>The majority of the staff have worked at the centre for many years. Six out of the eight teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, tuakana teina (collaboration) and the principles and strands of <em>Te WhƒÅriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is resourced to provide a variety of learning experiences. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into the programme in play-based ways. Children have choices about their involvement at certain times of the day. At these times they are well engaged in their learning. They are supported by a team of caring and respectful adults who know them well. To better support children's independence and empowerment as learners, teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the balance between child-initiated and adult-directed learning to provide more opportunities for child choice and perseverance in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide ongoing opportunities for children to participate in creative, open-ended activities in sustained ways.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Enduring relationships with families have led to high levels of family support. Parents' and whƒÅnau views are sought and valued to inform decision-making about operation.</p><p>Provision for children requiring additional learning support is prioritised. Good knowledge of support agencies in the local community is evident.</p><p>Flexible routines and consistency of caregiving, support infants' and toddlers' wellbeing and sense of belonging. However, aspects of provision for these youngest children need further development, particularly in relation to the organisation and implementation of play and routine times.</p><p>Teachers plan for children's transitions into and out of the centre. New children are supported by an entry process that is suitably flexible and based on their own and their family's needs. A programme and practices are in place to support children's transitions from the service to primary school. The next step is to further develop relationships with local schools and seek ways of sharing information about children's learning with new-entrant teachers.</p><p>The philosophy expresses a commitment to integrating a MƒÅori perspective into the programme. Short phrases in te reo MƒÅori are used by some staff and some resourcing has been put in place. Priority should be given to strengthening understanding of te ao MƒÅori to inform a more bicultural approach and better support for MƒÅori learners and their families.</p><p>Written guidelines outline expectations for the development of the learning programme for children. Teachers regularly identify themes and children's interests in play and use these as a basis for planning activities. Some portfolios show how teachers are noticing, recognising and responding to children's interests and working to include parents' input in their approach. To strengthen planning for learning, teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the emphasis on children's learning and progress and plan strategies to add complexity to their learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to encourage parents' input into their children's profile books and formally plan to meet the aspirations they have for their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledge families' cultures, languages and identities in assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider reviewing their approach to planning for the group.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Self review is at a very early stage of implementation. Teachers should develop and use a framework for evaluation that supports good decision-making about change and results in improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The staff team is well established. Although teachers are collaborative and supportive of each other, at the time of this review there was insufficient support in place to build and sustain the quality of their professional practice. Building staff capability is identified as strategic priority, however it is not sufficiently funded, nor is it well supported through the appraisal process. A revised approach to appraisal is being developed that has the potential to better support teachers' build their capability and reflect on their practice, in relation to professional teaching requirements.</p><p>The management committee works collaboratively with the head teacher to govern and manage the service. High levels of commitment from members are evident. Regular meetings support discussion about issues and plans for development. Decision-making is informed by a suitable reporting process. A strategic plan outlines priorities for development. To further promote improvement and decision-making committee members should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further define governance roles and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>redevelop the annual management plan to better support the timely review of policies, and other governance requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify desired outcomes, timelines, actions and responsibilities in the strategic plan to support the reporting of progress and decisions about next development steps.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation has found that next steps for development are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the programme for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning and organisation for children's learning, including routines and resourcing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development of teachers' understanding of te ao Maori and implementation of a</p>
</li>
</ul><p>more bicultural perspective across the service</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ongoing support for teacher capability through planned development opportunities linked to centre priorities and teacher needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and internal evaluation to support sustained good practice and continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Marlborough St Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service‚Äôs systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children‚Äôs health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Marlborough St Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>29 September 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO‚Äôs reports provide information for parents and communities about each service‚Äôs strengths and next steps for development. ERO‚Äôs bicultural evaluation framework NgƒÅ Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere ‚Äì how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou ƒÄrahi ‚Äì how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>MƒÅtauranga ‚Äì whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako ‚Äì how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> ‚Äì self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> ‚Äì partnerships with parents and whƒÅnau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are MƒÅori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and NgƒÅ Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO‚Äôs Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO‚Äôs Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed ‚Äì The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development ‚Äì The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO‚Äôs website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service‚Äôs context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
